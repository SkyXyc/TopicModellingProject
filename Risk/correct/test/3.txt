Much of the Company’s lending is in northern and central New Jersey. As a result of this geographic concentration, a further continued significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions in the New Jersey metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, results of operations and future growth potential. A prolonged decline in economic conditions in our market area could restrict borrowers’ ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due, and consequently, adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of the Company’s business.
