The Company faces significant competition from many other banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions which have branch offices or otherwise operate in the Companyâ€™s market area. Non-bank financial institutions, such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies and money market funds, engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business, which has also led to greater competition. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the Company, including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the Company is able to accommodate and the ability to aggressively advertise their products and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable. There can be no assurance that the Company and the Bank will be able to successfully compete with these entities in the future.
