On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule (the “Final Rule”) to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. banking organizations. On July 9, 2013, the FDIC approved an interim final rule (which became final in April 2014 with no substantive changes) that was substantially similar to the Final Rule. Effective January 1, 2015, these new requirements establish the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition, there is a new requirement to maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of CET1 capital, in an amount greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over the minimum capital required by each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on the organization’s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in, beginning January 1, 2016, and initially require a buffer amount greater than 0.625% during 2016 in order to avoid these limitations. Following 2016, the required amount of the capital conservation buffer will continue to increase each year until January 1, 2019 when the buffer amount must be greater than 2.5% in order to avoid the above limitations.
