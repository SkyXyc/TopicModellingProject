As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC modified its assessment rules so that an institutionâ€™s deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity. These assessment base rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks and up to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV banks. Risk Category II and III banks have assessment base rates ranging from 9 to 33 basis points, respectively. If the risk category of the Bank changes adversely, our FDIC insurance premiums could increase.
