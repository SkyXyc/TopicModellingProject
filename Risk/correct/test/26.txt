Our belief that cost savings and revenue enhancements are achievable in any future acquisition is a forward-looking statement that is inherently uncertain. The combined bankâ€™s actual cost savings and revenue enhancements, if any, for any future acquisition cannot be quantified at this time. Any actual cost savings or revenue enhancements will depend on future expense levels and operating results, the timing of certain events and general industry, regulatory and business conditions. Many of these events will be beyond the control of the combined bank.
