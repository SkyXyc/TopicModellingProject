The Company is currently authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,954,314 shares were outstanding on February 29, 2016. We may decide to issue additional shares of common stock for any corporate purposes. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock in public offerings or up to 20% of our outstanding common stock in non-public offerings. Any issuance of shares of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our common shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock or dilute the book value of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.
