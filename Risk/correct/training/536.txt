While this relationship applies to all fixed-rate financial instruments, the primary instruments whose carrying values are affected by price/market risk are traded instruments. Since the Company currently has only an available-for-sale portfolio and does not maintain investment securities in a trading account, market fluctuations are recorded through equity and not the statements of operations. On-going adverse fair values could cause some security fair values to deteriorate to the extent that they are considered to be other than temporary. At that time, the Company would be required to write-down security values to their fair value as a charge to earnings.
