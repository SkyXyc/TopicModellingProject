Our principal business operations are conducted through our subsidiary banks. Cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid by the subsidiary banks. The ability of the subsidiary banks to pay dividends, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of operations of the subsidiary banks and by certain legal and regulatory restrictions. Further, any lenders making loans to us may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than regulatory requirements with respect to our payment of dividends to stockholders. There can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends to our stockholders.
