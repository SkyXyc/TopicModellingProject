We may not be able to correctly identify profitable locations for new branches and the costs to start up new branch facilities or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest expense and decrease earnings in the short term. If other banks or branches of other banks become available for sale, we may acquire them. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage our growth through the establishment of these branches. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these branch sites will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses of operating these branch sites. Our failure to identify profitable locations, or to manage such branches in a profitable manner could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and on the value of our common stock. Furthermore, any new or acquired branches will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in securing such approvals.
