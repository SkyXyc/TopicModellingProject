Identity theft and data breaches are on the rise. To date, our losses have been immaterial due in part to our client awareness program, systems and controls. While we regularly review activity and adopt new practices when warranted to control exposure, we have no way of predicting when a compromise may occur and the magnitude or liability arising from such a compromise. In particular, the occurrence of identity theft or data breaches could expose the Corporation to risks of data loss or data misuse, could damage the Corporation’s reputation and result in the loss of customers and business, could subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose the Corporation to civil litigation, possible financial liability and costly remedial measures. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.
