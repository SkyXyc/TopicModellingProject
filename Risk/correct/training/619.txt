We have supported our continued growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trust and the accompanying sale of a $10.0 million junior subordinated debenture to such trust. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of this trust are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures that we issued to the trust are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holder of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, however, in the event of such a deferral, no dividends may be paid on our common stock.
