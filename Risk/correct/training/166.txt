Our success is, and expected to remain, highly dependent on our senior management team, including Messrs. Orlando, Schupp, Marino, Jacobson, and Ostermayer. As a community bank, it is our managementâ€™s extensive knowledge of and relationships in the community that generate business for us. Successful execution of our growth strategy will continue to place significant demands on our management and the loss of any such services may adversely affect our growth and profitability.
