Our status as a nonbank systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010, Dodd-Frank, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years.
