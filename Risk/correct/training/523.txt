The Company was notified by NASDAQ on December 9, 2009 of its non-compliance with listing standards. After regaining compliance on January 4, 2010, the Company once again was notified of non-compliance on March 8, 2010. The notification requires compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements within 180 days. If the Company is unable to regain compliance, the common stock would be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Delisting could reduce the ability of investors to purchase or sell AMCORE’s common stock as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically.
