In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board released its final rules which will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets of 4.5% and a Common Equity Tier I Capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also, among other things, raises the minimum ratio of Tier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets from 4% to 6% and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. We must begin transitioning to the new rules effective January 1, 2015. The impact of the new capital rules is likely to require us to maintain higher levels of capital, which will lower our return on equity.
