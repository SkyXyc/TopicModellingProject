As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our loan clients may not repay their loans according to their terms and any collateral securing payment may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs we incur disposing of the collateral. Although we have collateral for most of our loans, that collateral can fluctuate in value and may not always cover the outstanding balance on the loan. With most of our loans concentrated in Northern Virginia, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of our real estate collateral. Consequently, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our net income and capital than on the net income and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.
