We also periodically review products for potential loss recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products.  This review involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires significant management judgment about assumptions including mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including net realized capital gains (losses). If actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which could negatively affect our results of operations.  For further discussion of DAC and future policy benefits, see Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
