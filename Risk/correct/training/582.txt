We may not be able to effectively manage changes in interest rates that affect what we charge as interest on our earning assets and the expense we must pay on interest-bearing liabilities, which may significantly reduce our earnings and reduce the value of our common stock. Since rates charged on our loans often tend to react to market conditions faster than do rates paid on our deposit accounts, these rate cuts may have a negative impact on our earnings until we could make appropriate adjustments in our deposit rates. Fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable and, therefore, there can be no assurances of our ability to continue to maintain a consistent positive spread between the interest earned on our earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities.
