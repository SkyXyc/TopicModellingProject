Among the Dodd-Frank Act’s significant regulatory changes, the Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a financial consumer protection agency that has the authority to impose new regulations and include its examiners in routine regulatory examinations conducted by the Comptroller. The CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, which may directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Corporation and the Bank.  This agency’s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction or consumer financial product or service.  Although the CFPB generally has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Corporation, the Bank and/or the Mortgage Division by virtue of the adoption of such policies and best practices by the Federal Reserve Board, Comptroller and FDIC.  The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that may be placed upon the Corporation with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined.  However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may produce significant, material effects on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
