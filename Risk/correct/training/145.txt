Our failure to comply with the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements or to properly service the loans and OREO under the requirements of the Loss Sharing Agreements may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss sharing payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated.
