We may not be able to realize the full value of our deferred tax asset. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, coupled with unused tax credits and tax benefits from operating loss carryforwards. At DecemberÂ 31, 2014, our net deferred tax asset was $4.3 million. The net deferred tax asset was composed of approximately $1.2 million of tax benefit from both state and federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $954,000 of tax benefit from temporary differences between book and tax income and an unused federal tax credit of $2.7 million, reduced by a valuation allowance of $608,000.
