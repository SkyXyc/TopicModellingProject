The fact that certain significant shareholders have additional shares registered for sale may depress market prices of our common stock â€” We have filed a registration statement with the SEC covering the potential sale by 1st Source Bank as trustee of the certain trusts established for the benefit of the extended families of two of the children of Ernestine Raclin. Approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock remained registered for sale as of December 31, 2015, and may be sold after February 28, 2016, under the registration statement at the direction of the principal beneficiaries of the pertinent trusts and certain other selling shareholders. Such holders may choose to sell their remaining registered shares at any time. Some market participants may assume that such remaining shares will become available to the market relatively soon and choose to defer purchasing our shares on the market. This may, in turn have an effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. In addition, the future sale of substantial amounts of common stock by the holders of such registered shares may also depress the market price of our common stock.
