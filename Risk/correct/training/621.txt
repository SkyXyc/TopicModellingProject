Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Uncertain expectations for global economic growth have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for credit and payment products. A prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors, including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and also tend to decline during general economic downturns. Further, economic instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and business spending in other parts of the world. If economic conditions were to worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
