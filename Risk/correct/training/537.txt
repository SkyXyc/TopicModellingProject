Our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risk. At December 31, 2014, our loan portfolio consisted of $111.5 million, or 34.7%, of commercial real estate loans, $13.6 million, or 4.2%, of construction loans (primarily commercial properties) and $29.4 million, or 9.1%, of commercial and industrial loans and leases. We intend to continue to maintain our emphasis on the origination of commercial loans. However, these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers and, for construction loans, the accuracy of the estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. Commercial and construction loans typically involve larger loan balances compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrower’s business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four-family residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans. Also, many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.
