In the U.S., the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which specifies the regulatory actions the insurance regulator may take if an insurer’s RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. Regulators at the federal and international levels are also considering the imposition of additional group-wide capital requirements on certain insurance companies designated as systemically important, that may augment state-law RBC standards that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made on bases other than the statutory statements of our insurance subsidiaries. See “Our status as a nonbank systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows” and “Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation” below for additional information on increased capital requirements that may be imposed on us. We cannot predict the effect these initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
