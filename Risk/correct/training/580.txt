Our strategy has been to increase the size of our company by opening new offices, acquiring other banks and by pursuing business development opportunities. We have grown rapidly since we commenced operations. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that our further expansion will be profitable or that we will continue to be able to sustain our historical rate of growth, either through internal growth or through successful expansion of our markets, or that we will be able to maintain capital sufficient to support our continued growth. If we grow too quickly, however, and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, rapid growth also could adversely affect our financial performance. Any of these risks could negatively impact the value of our common stock.
