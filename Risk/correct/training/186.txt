1st United provides its customers the ability to bank online. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking. 1st United’s network or those of its customers could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems. 1st United may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that 1st United’s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose 1st United to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in 1st United’s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and its ability to generate deposits.
