Although the Company employs a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, or that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed.  Additionally, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
