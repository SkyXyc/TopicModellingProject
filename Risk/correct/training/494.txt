Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and competition. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest that the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of loans and securities which are collateralized by mortgages. Earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by interest rate changes.
