Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position.  Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised.   Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
