We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the receivables generated with respect to its program, which could result in a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding. For example, we previously announced that our U.S. cobrand relationship with Costco is set to end in 2016 and we expect to sell the outstanding Card Member loans associated with the Costco portfolio. For a discussion on Costco and our expectations regarding the portfolio sale, see “Business Environment” under “MD&A.” In November 2015, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, with which we have a cobrand relationship, announced that it agreed to be acquired by Marriott International, which has a cobrand relationship with a competing card issuer.
