Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our U.S. bank subsidiaries. The FDIA in certain circumstances prohibits banks, including Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, from accepting brokered deposits and applies other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates we may pay. See “Prompt Corrective Action” under “Regulation and Supervision” for additional information. A significant amount of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits has been raised through third-party brokerage networks, and such deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes.
