We maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of our clients relative to their financial obligations with us. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in borrowersâ€™ circumstances and economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values that are beyond our control, and these future losses may exceed our current estimates. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio, we cannot predict such losses or guarantee that our allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material impact on our financial performance and reduce our net income and capital.
