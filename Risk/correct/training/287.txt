The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is further limited by certain restrictions imposed generally on Florida corporations under the Florida Business Corporation Act, specifically, no cash dividends may be paid if, after payment, (a) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or (b) the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
