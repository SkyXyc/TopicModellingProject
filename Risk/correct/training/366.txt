We have grown substantially in the past several years from approximately $2.03 billion in total assets at December 31, 1999 (as restated for a 2001 pooling-of-interests transaction) to approximately $7.67 billion in total assets at December 31, 2006. This growth has been achieved through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Our future profitability will depend in part on our continued ability to grow. We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow our business at all in the future. We may also not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for additional acquisitions in the future. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may impede or prohibit our ability to acquire additional bank subsidiaries or open or acquire new branch offices.
