From time to time as part of the Company’s normal course of business, customers make claims and take legal actions against the Company based on actions or inactions of the Company.  If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services.  This may also impact customer demand for the Company’s products and services.  Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
