Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key human resource talent. Competition for the best employees in most activities and functions we are engaged in can be intense and we may not be able to hire employees or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.
