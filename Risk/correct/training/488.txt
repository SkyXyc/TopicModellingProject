Credit risk is affected by a variety of factors including the credit-worthiness of the borrower or other party, the sufficiency of underlying collateral, the enforceability of third-party guarantees, errors in underwriting, changing economic and industry conditions and concentrations of credit by loan type, terms or geographic area, changes in the financial condition of the borrower or other party, and by credit and underwriting policies.
