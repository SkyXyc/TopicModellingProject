A significant portion of our primary markets are located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather, or in response to climate change, that could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business.  Additionally, surrounding areas, including New Jersey, may be central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the United States. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused destruction along the East Coast, including in New Jersey, and resulted in, among other things, severe property damage and the closure of many businesses and financial markets.  The financial impact to the Company was minimal as our mortgage loan customers in the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy did not sustain severe damage to their real properties and we experienced no loan delinquencies specifically related to Hurricane Sandy. In 2014 and 2015, our market area was the subject of severe cold weather and several snow storms which disrupted commercial activities and the Bank’s operations.
