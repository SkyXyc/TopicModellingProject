Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reported past substantial losses and a need for substantial amounts of additional capital. Such losses were due to these entities’ business models being tied extensively to the U.S. housing market which severely contracted during the recent economic downturn. In response to the deteriorating financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the U.S. housing market contraction, Congress and the U.S. Treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these entities. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, was established in July 2008 pursuant to the Regulatory Reform Act in an effort to enhance regulatory oversight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal conservatorship in September 2008. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have returned to profitability as a result of the housing market recovery, but their long-term financial viability is highly dependent on governmental support. If the governmental support is inadequate, these companies could fail to offer programs necessary to an active secondary market. In addition, future policies that change the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government, including those that result in their winding down, nationalization, privatization, or elimination may have broad adverse implications for the residential mortgage market, the mortgage-backed securities market and the Mortgage Division’s business, operations and financial condition. If this were to occur, the Mortgage Division’s ability to sell mortgage loans readily could be hampered, and the profitability of the Bank could be significantly reduced.
