In consultation with its professional advisors, the Bank resubmitted a combined CRP and Disposition Plan by the required December 4, 2009 due date. By return letter dated January 8, 2010 (the “Response Letter”), the OCC notified the Bank that its CRP was not acceptable. According to the OCC, the CRP was not accepted because, among other things, it did not meet the statutory requirements that the CRP be based on “realistic assumptions” and be likely to succeed in restoring the Bank’s capital. In addition, on January 12, 2010, the FRB notified the Company that the Company’s capital plan previously submitted to the FRB continued to be unacceptable in addressing the capital erosion of the Company and the Bank. The Response Letter provided that even if the Bank’s capital ratios improve to the undercapitalized category, the Bank would continue to be subject to operational restrictions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions until such time as the Bank has submitted to the OCC an acceptable CRP. The OCC also stated its view that the recently announced asset sales by the Bank have increased the overall risk to the Bank’s capital base.
