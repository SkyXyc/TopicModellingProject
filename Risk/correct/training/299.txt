Changes in interest rates, particularly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, also affect the value of our loans. In setting its policy, the Federal Reserve Board may utilize techniques such as: (i) engaging in open market transactions in United States government securities; (ii) setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) determining reserve requirements. These techniques may have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or our business and operations. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers’ ability to pay the principal or interest on existing loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in our non-performing assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from our loans, any of which could have a material and negative effect on our results of operations. We try to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but we are unable to completely eliminate this risk. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material and negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board’s Federal Open Market Committee has stated that it expects to keep the federal funds target rate at 0.25% - 0.50% until economic and labor conditions (as indicated by the unemployment rate and the inflation rate) improve. Sustained low interest rates could put further pressure on the yields generated by the Corporation’s loan portfolio and on the Corporation’s net interest margin.
