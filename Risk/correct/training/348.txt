Reputation risk, or the risk to our businessesâ€™ (including our primary commercial banking business and secondary mortgage lending business) net income and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees or our access to the capital markets and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action.
