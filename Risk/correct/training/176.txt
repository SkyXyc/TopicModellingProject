As of December 31, 2013, 1st United’s allowance for loan losses was $9.6 million, which represented approximately 0.85% of its total amount of loans. 1st United had $15.8 million in non-accruing loans as of December 31, 2013, of which approximately $6.8 million are covered by Loss Sharing Agreements. The allowance may not prove sufficient to cover future loan losses. Although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to 1st United’s non-performing or performing loans. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen. Material additions to 1st United’s allowance for loan losses would adversely impact our net income and capital.
