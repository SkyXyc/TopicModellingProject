On March 9, 2011, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax loss and credit carryforwards, and on January 8, 2014, the Board adopted an amendment to the Plan, extending its expiration date to January 8, 2017. The amendment of the Plan was ratified by our shareholders at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in an “ownership change.” At our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to adopt a successor to the Protective Amendment that contains substantially the same terms as the Protective Amendment and that expires on May 12, 2017, the third anniversary of the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
