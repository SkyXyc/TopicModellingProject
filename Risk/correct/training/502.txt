As of December 31, 2009, the Bank was considered “significantly undercapitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines. As a result of this designation, the Bank is no longer eligible to participate in the brokered CD market and is also subject to limitations with respect to interest rates it can offer on deposits, generally limited to rates equal to no more than 75 basis points above prevailing market rates. These limitations, as well as recent increased collateral requirements and advance limitations with respect to other funding sources, may have a material impact on the Bank’s deposit levels and liquidity. In particular, the inability to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits could put a severe strain on the Bank’s liquidity because of the limited ability to replace maturing brokered deposits with core deposits.
