We regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences, as well as tax strategies available to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income. We currently expect that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at DecemberÂ 31, 2014 will be fully realizable based on our expected future earnings. Realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings and capital through a related reversal of the current valuation allowance.
