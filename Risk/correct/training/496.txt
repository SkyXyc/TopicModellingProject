Maintaining sufficient capital serves as a buffer against potential credit and other losses that the Company may encounter during difficult times. There are five levels of capital defined by regulation: “well-capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”. The OCC has advised the Bank that it is being treated as “significantly undercapitalized”. Capital risk includes the potential effect on the Company’s reputation as well as certain other potential consequences should the capital level fall below well-capitalized. As a result of the Bank being “significantly undercapitalized”, the Bank is currently experiencing changes in the Bank’s borrowing costs and terms from regulatory authorities and other third parties, the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance premiums, and AMCORE’s ability to access brokered CD markets.
