Virtually all of our businesses operate under the “Access National” brand. Any actual or alleged conduct by one of our businesses could result in negative public opinion about our other businesses under the Access National brand. Because our businesses rely on and leverage the strength of the Access National brand any negative public opinion that tarnishes our Access National brand may negatively impact our business, client relationships and financial performance. Although we take steps to minimize our reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, due to the nature of the commercial banking and mortgage lending businesses we will always face some measure of reputational risk.
