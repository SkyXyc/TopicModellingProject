We may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth, to fund losses or additional provisions for loan losses in the future, or to maintain certain capital levels in accordance with banking regulations. Such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital may also be restricted by the Loss-Sharing Agreements we entered into with the FDIC if the capital raise would effect a change in control of 1st United.
