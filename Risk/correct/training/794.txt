Our restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency. We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect to result from our restructuring initiatives. Actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement these initiatives, and the implementation of these initiatives may harm our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. The successful implementation of these initiatives has required us and will continue to require us to effect workforce reductions, business rationalizations, systems enhancements, business process outsourcing, business and asset dispositions and other actions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position, our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected.
