The Company’s capital has declined due to recent credit losses. The Company lost $98 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 and lost $224 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. While it expects to be able to generate profits at some point in the future, there can be no assurance of when, or if, it will return to profitability. Given recent losses, asset quality issues, and overall financial condition, the Company must raise additional capital to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to comply with regulatory requirements and to meet its commitments and business needs. AMCORE may not be able to raise the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
