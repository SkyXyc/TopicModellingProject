Liquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by our inability to access secured lending markets, brokered deposit markets or raise funding in the long-term or short-term capital markets. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair our ability to raise funding. In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) or deposit brokers develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity, regulatory authorities take significant action against us, or we discover employee misconduct or illegal activity, among other things. If we were unable to raise funds using the methods described above, we would likely need to liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment and loan portfolios, to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect our operations.
