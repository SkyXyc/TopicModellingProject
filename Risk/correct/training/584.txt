Our success depends to a large degree on the general economic conditions in our market areas. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we make to our borrowers, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect our financial condition and performance and the value of our common stock.
