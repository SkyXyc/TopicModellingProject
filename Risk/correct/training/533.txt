Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose AMCORE to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client. In addition, AMCORE’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, investment or derivative exposure. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect AMCORE’s financial condition and results of operations.
