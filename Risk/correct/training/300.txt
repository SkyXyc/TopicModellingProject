At December 31, 2015 approximately 58% of the loans held for investment were variable rate loans. A majority of these loans are based on the prime rate and will adjust upwards as the prime rate increases. While the variable rate structure on these loans reduces interest rate risk for the Bank, increases in rates may cause the borrowerâ€™s required payment to increase which, in turn, may increase the risk of payment default.
