Our nonperforming loans have declined, however, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. For 2014, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $322,000. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $412,000. Although we have experienced a slowly improving local economic recovery, other real estate owned has remained at a relatively high level totaling $6.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Our nonperforming loans totaled $4.4 million, representing 1.37% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. Loans classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss totaled $11.9 million, representing 3.72% of total loans at December 31, 2014. If these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance, we may be required to add further reserves to our allowance for loan losses or we may experience loan losses, which could have a material effect on our operating results. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results.
