Interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time and we expect interest rates to rise in the future. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net income, could fall. Our interest expense was approximately $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 1.0 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately $216 million as of December 31, 2015. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balance amounts Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations.
