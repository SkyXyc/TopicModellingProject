Presently, the Company has four primary strategic initiatives: credit risk management, cost efficiencies, capital and liquidity, and broadening customer relationships. The Company’s ability to successfully execute these initiatives depends upon a variety of factors, including its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities and locations, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in its new market areas, the stability of the Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio, and the ability to manage client relationships across all of its business segments. For an expanded discussion on these initiatives, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
