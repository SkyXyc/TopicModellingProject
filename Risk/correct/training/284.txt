We declared a special dividend in December 2012 and December 2013 and also commenced a regular quarterly dividend in 2013. However, the payment of dividends to our shareholders depends largely upon the ability of 1st United to declare and pay dividends to us, as the principal source of our revenue is from such dividends. Our ability to declare and pay dividends depend primarily upon earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and 1st United.
