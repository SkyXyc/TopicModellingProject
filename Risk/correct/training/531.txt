The Company is taking all appropriate actions, including pursuing capital raising activities in order to increase capital and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in the FRB Agreement and Consent Order. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in those efforts. Any such capital raising alternatives could dilute the percentage ownership of existing holders of AMCORE’s outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock.
