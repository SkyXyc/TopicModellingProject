The Corporationâ€™s success depends significantly on the general economic conditions in the markets in which it operates. The economy of our primary market, the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area is significantly affected by federal government spending. In particular, Fairfax County, Virginia receives more federal procurement dollars than any other county in Virginia. Some of our customers may be particularly sensitive to the level of federal government spending, which is affected by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, administrative and congressional priorities and the ability of the federal government to enact relevant appropriations bills and other legislation. Any of these or other factors could result in future cuts in, or uncertainty with respect to, federal spending, which could have a severe negative impact on individuals and businesses in our primary market areas. Any related increase in unemployment rates or reduction in business development activities in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area could lead to increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral values, as well as other adverse implications that we cannot predict, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and financial condition.
