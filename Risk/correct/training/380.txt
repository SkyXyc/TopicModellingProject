Our success depends to a certain extent on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets served by our subsidiary banks in the states of Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the subsidiary banksâ€™ commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the Southeastern United States in general or any one or more of these local markets could negatively impact the financial results of our banking operations and have a negative effect on our profitability.
