At December 31, 2013, our nonperforming assets (which consist of non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90+ days delinquent, and foreclosed real estate assets) totaled $34.4 million, or 1.87 % of total assets, which is a decrease of $8.5 million or 19.9% over nonperforming assets at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, our nonperforming assets were $42.9 million or 2.74% of total assets and $57.0 million or 4.01%, respectively. Nonperforming assets included $17.6 million, $24.6 million, and $23.0 million assets covered by Loss Sharing Agreements as of December 31, 2013, DecemberÂ 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses as well as from time to time, as appropriate, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity. Finally, if our estimate for the recorded allowance for loan losses proves to be incorrect and our allowance is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly.
