By letter dated November 4, 2009 (the “Letter”), the OCC notified the Bank of its finding that the capital plan submitted pursuant to the Consent Order (the “Capital Plan”) was “not acceptable”, stating that the OCC was unable to determine that the Capital Plan “was likely to succeed in restoring the Bank’s capital at this time.” The OCC further advised the Bank that it was being treated as “significantly undercapitalized” within the meaning of the prompt corrective action (the “PCA”) provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and implementing OCC regulations. The Bank was required to submit a capital restoration plan and a disposition plan pursuant to the Letter. On November 6, 2009, the FRB notified the Company in writing that the Company’s capital plan submitted under the terms of the FRB Agreement was unacceptable in addressing the capital erosion of the Company and the Bank. For further information regarding the requirements and limitations of the OCC Agreement, the FRB Agreement, the Consent Order and the Letter, see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
