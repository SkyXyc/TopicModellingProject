A wide range of regulatory initiatives directed at the financial services industry has been proposed and/or implemented in recent years. One of those initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010 and mandates significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape that have impacted and will continue to impact all financial institutions, including the Corporation and the Bank.  Since its enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act has increased, and will likely continue to increase, the Corporation’s regulatory compliance burden and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation by increasing the costs associated with regulatory examinations and compliance measures. However, it is too early to fully assess the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent regulatory rulemaking processes on the Corporation’s and the Bank’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
