Our results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, particularly in light of the continuing threat of terrorist acts and the current military operations in the Middle East, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or the business and earnings of Alabama National. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to such terrorist attacks and the military operations in the Middle East may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.
