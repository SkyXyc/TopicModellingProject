AIG Parent’s ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. AIG Parent has in the past and expects to continue to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flow obligations.  If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary insurer’s financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.
