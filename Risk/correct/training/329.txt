The Dodd-Frank Act also increases regulatory supervision and examination of bank holding companies and their banking and non-banking subsidiaries. These and other regulations included in the Dodd-Frank Act could increase the Corporation’s regulatory compliance burden and costs, restrict the financial products and services the Corporation can offer to its customers and restrict the Corporation’s ability to generate revenues from non-banking operations. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies, which may cause the Corporation to reevaluate elements of its business focus and shape future capital strategies.
