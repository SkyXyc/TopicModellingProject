I was originally planning on having lunch at La Perdiz but I am turned off by what appears to be a prepubescent child's private, 20+ person birthday party (complete with balloons and noisemakers) around 13:00, and the fact that the restaurant is completely empty (yet fully staffed) at 14:30. I instead decide to go to La Abadia. Although I had been there on my last visit, it is still highly recommended on the Internets. By the time I trek across the city to get there (around 15:00), the restaurant is packed. I thankfully grab one of the last seats in the house, down in the smoking section (i.e. a subterranean vault). Somehow on my previous visit to Toledo I had neglected to try Perdiz Toledo (partridge), which was what originally interested me in La Perdiz. Luckily La Abadia has Perdiz on the menu and it is divine (albeit very bony, which is expected). The partridge is falling off of its tiny little bones into a dark, allspice flavored broth thickened with natural gelatin. I start off with a salad of saut√©ed goat cheese and pine nuts, which is quite good also, but not nearly as memorable. 
After lunch I visit a three-fingered sword smith/engraver, eat some marzipan at Santo Tom√© and head back to Madrid. 
I decide to give Tienda de Vinos another try, this time attempting to arrive a bit earlier to avoid the rush. I arrive at about 21:30 (an hour or so before the typical Madrid dinner rush) and score one of the last seats in the house. Now, I've been to a handful of restaurants that have the same type of setup/philosophy as Tienda de Vinos, and they invariably turn out to be some of the best meals of my life; this one was no different. The telltale signs of an awesome place include: 
I order (in my no doubt heavily-accented Spanish) the sopa de ajo and Callos a la Madrileña, upon which the waiter just smiled and whisked away to get me my wine and water. I was, for a moment, tempted by the Sesos (fried cow brains), but recommendations for the Callos (not to mention fears of bovine spongiform encephalopathy) swayed me otherwise. The soup is surprisingly subtle and delicate, tasting more of unicorn tears than garlic. Amazing. The Callos is the best tripe I have ever had. 
Even though deep down I believe it to have passed, I'd like to blame my jet lag for how long it took me to wake up this morning. I could also blame the weather, which is piss poor. I shower, dress, and step out on my balcony to survey an animal rights protest in front of one of Madrid's only McDonalds outposts in the plaza seven floors below.  It's cold and I'm getting wet. I lucked out yesterday in Toledo with overcast skies and, once in a while, a spot of sunshine, but today it's really raining.
