Along with the coffee the waitress kindly pours me a shot of a golden spirit which she informs me is a specialty from somewhere in the North. As I am never one to offend with the refusal of such hospitality, I graciously oblige. The spirit tasted subtly of anise, almost like liquid fennel. It is wonderful. My only regret is that I cannot remember the name. 
From lunch I take the metro directly to the Atocha station to see the Reina Sofia museum; I'm told it has free admission on Saturday afternoons. I had visited the museum on my previous visit to Madrid, but it really is one of my favorites. Apparently I am not the only one with the bright idea of saving a few Euros on admission: the queue is huge.  It ends up being a 30 minute wait, in the rain, under my flimsy little hotel loaner umbrella. It is worth it, though. 
After a few hours ogling the likes of Dal’ and Picasso, I zip over to Sol to try and find a famed sherry bar called La Venencia. Unfortunately the bar hasn't yet opened, so I walk another few blocks with the intention of completing my tapas crawl from two days prior. The tapas places haven't yet reopened after siesta, though, so I am out of luck. The single eatery that is open is the Museo del Jam—n. Despite its name, it's really more of a franchised bar/restaurant than a museum. It's a very touristy, but I am hungry for a snack so I enter and order a plate of Iberica. The Japanese businessman next to me is just finishing a plate of his own and wishes to ask for the bill. He whips out his Madrid tour guide, studies it for what seems like five minutes.
The train from Madrid to Lisbon departs at 22:45. It's an eleven hour journey. Due to extenuating circumstances includingâ€”but not limited toâ€”the perihelion of Mercury, I have somehow scored a first class cabin all to myself, including a meal in the dining car. I settle into my tiny cabin; the only "first class" aspect of which is that it has an ensuite bathroom, which was not entirely unexpected. 
I am the only unaccompanied person in the first class car, and seemingly the only one below retirement age. The other three cabins are all likewise occupied by non-Europeans. My neighbors, I learn, are a couple that live in Jamaica. The husband, one Clinton P. Chin, J.P. (which I assume stands for "Justice of the Peace") is the chairman of the Chinese Twinning Commission for Hangzhou ? Montego Bay and Zhejiang Province. Apparently, the Twinning Commission oversees relations and commerce between the aforementioned regional pairs. I do not discover this until His Worship, the Honourable Mr. Chin gave me his business card, so I do not have a chance to ask him what types of commerce occurs between Hangzhou and Zhejiang and their respective Rasta relations.
