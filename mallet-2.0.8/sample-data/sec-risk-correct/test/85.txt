The Company’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition.  Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company’s assets or liabilities and financial results.  The Company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security impairment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.
