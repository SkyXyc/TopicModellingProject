The application of these capital requirements could increase the Company’s required capital levels and the cost of capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase in the Company’s cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities, among other things. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations or items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could also result in management modifying the Company’s business strategy and limiting the Company’s ability to repurchase our common stock. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in us having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Although most financial institutions would be affected, these business impacts could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business and product mix of each institution. Other potential adverse effects could include higher dilution of common shareholders if we had to issue additional shares and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in an adverse economic cycle.
