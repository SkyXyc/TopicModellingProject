The price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market constantly changes and recently, given the uncertainty in the financial markets, has fluctuated widely.  From the beginning of fiscal year 2014 through the end of fiscal year 2015, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $12.37 per share and a low of $8.80 per share.  We expect that the market closing price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
