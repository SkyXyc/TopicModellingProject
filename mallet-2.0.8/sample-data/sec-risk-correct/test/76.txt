Insured depository institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, could significantly increase the loss provisions of the FDIC, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to historical lows. Effective January 1, 2011, the FDIC increased the designated reserve ratio from 1.25% to 2.00%. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per insured depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, which may result in even larger losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
