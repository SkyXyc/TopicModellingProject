Our primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, the inherent primary risks are deteriorating credit quality, a decline in the economy, and a decline in New Jersey real estate market values. Any one, or a combination, of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies, loan losses and increased future provision levels.
