During the last eight years, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. As a result, yields have been at levels lower than were available prior to 2008 on securities we have purchased and loans we have originated. Consequently, the average yield on our interest-earning assets has decreased during the low interest rate environment. As a general matter, our interest-bearing assets re-price or mature more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. Our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. While the Federal Reserve Board raised the targeted federal funds rate and discount rate in December 2015 and may further raise the targeted federal funds rate and discount rate in 2016, we believe that interest rates may remain relatively low for the near future. Accordingly, our net interest margin may decline, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability.
