Our customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services. Our success depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services. We need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth. In addition, competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individualsâ€™ relationships with their customers and communities and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals. If we are unable to attract and retain our branch managers and lending officers, and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, our business strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
