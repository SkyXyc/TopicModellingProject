In addition, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") recently updated the criteria in its Internal-Control Integrated Framework for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has adopted such updated criteria, which materially changed the manner in which the Company assesses its internal controls over financial reporting. In the future, there may be further changes to the criteria used to assess the effectiveness of internal controls, which may result in the Company expending more resources to assess its internal controls.
