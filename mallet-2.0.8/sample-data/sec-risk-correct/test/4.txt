The Company’s loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate collateral located in the State of New Jersey. Conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the Company’s loans are located strongly influence the level of the Company’s non-performing loans and results of operations. A continued decline in the New Jersey real estate markets could adversely affect the Company’s loan portfolio. Decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for the Company’s loans. Adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.
