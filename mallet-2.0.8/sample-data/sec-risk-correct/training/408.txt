Certain provisions of state and federal law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws might have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including our shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquiror and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholderâ€™s best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by shareholders and may make removal of management more difficult.
