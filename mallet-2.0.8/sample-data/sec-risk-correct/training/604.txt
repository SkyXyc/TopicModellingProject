Our articles of incorporation include anti-takeover provisions, including a supermajority vote requirement for a merger under certain circumstances as well as a provision allowing our Board of Directors to consider the social and economic effects of a proposed merger. Such provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock and discouraging a change of control even when favored by a majority of the shareholders.
