We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth. Because of our relatively small size and short operating history, it will be difficult for us to replicate our historical earnings growth as we continue to expand. Consequently, our historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of our future operations. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, and competition, may also impede our ability to expand our market presence. If we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of our operating costs are fixed expenses.
