As of DecemberÂ 31, 2012, approximately 33% of our loan and lease portfolio consisted of commercial loans and leases net of unearned income. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than conventional residential real estate loans or most consumer loans. Commercial loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
