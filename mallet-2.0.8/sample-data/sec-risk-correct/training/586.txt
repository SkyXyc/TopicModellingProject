Our success is largely dependent on the personal contacts of our officers and employees in our market area. If we lose key employees temporarily or permanently, our business could be hurt and the value of our common stock could decline as a result. We could be particularly hurt if our key employees went to work for our competitors. Our future success depends on the continued contributions of our existing senior management personnel.
