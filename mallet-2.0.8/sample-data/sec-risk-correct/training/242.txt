In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, 1st United has been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. If 1st United’s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that it has already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, 1st United would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions. Such regulatory action may include restrictions on 1st United’s ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including its acquisition plans. In addition, because 1st United operates in Florida and because of the recent acquisitions of Old Harbor Bank and the acquisition of AFI and EBI, we expect that 1st United will face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.
