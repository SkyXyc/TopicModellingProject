The integration of companies we acquire from time to time may not be as successful as we anticipate. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal and tax risks. Difficulties in integrating an acquired company may result in the acquired company performing differently than we expected or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. Risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
