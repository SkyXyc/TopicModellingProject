The Company’s Board of Directors continues to actively pursue strategic alternatives. The Company can give no assurance that AMCORE will identify an alternative that allows its stockholders to realize an increase in the value of the Company’s stock. The Company also can give no assurance that a transaction or other strategic alternative, once identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to its stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price. In addition, a transaction, which would likely involve equity financing, would result in substantial dilution to its current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of AMCORE’s common stock.
