If the Corporation were to require additional capital as a result of phasing in the Basel III Final Rules, it could be required to access the capital markets on short notice and in relatively weak economic conditions, which could result in banks raising capital that significantly dilutes existing shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation could be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios and interest income, to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. Higher capital levels may also lower the Corporationâ€™s return on equity.
