Price/market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. While this includes credit and liquidity risk, the Company considers interest-rate risk to be its most significant market risk. When interest rates increase, the fair value of a financial instrument on the asset side of the balance sheet will decrease. Conversely, when rates decline the fair value of the same instrument will increase.
