In January 2014, the Qualified Mortgage (QM) and Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) rules became effective under the Dodd Frank Act and may impact the willingness and ability of community banks and secondary market participants to make mortgage loans. Among other requirements, these rules require lenders to show that borrowers met an “ability to repay” test – which can be challenged in court for the entire life of the loan, raising the risk of litigation. Failure to prove the ability to repay can result in the lender’s obligation to reimburse the borrower for all payments made. Together with newly imposed timeline restrictions covering the liquidation of problem consumer mortgage loans, litigation over “ability to repay” may delay the time to collect on soured consumer mortgages and result in elevated problem assets and increased loss rates.
