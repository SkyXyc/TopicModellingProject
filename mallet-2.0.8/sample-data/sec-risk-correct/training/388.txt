Our profitability depends to a significant extent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. Changes in interest rates could also adversely affect the income of certain of our non-interest income businesses. For example, if mortgage interest rates increase, the demand for residential mortgage loans will likely decrease, and this would have an adverse effect on our gain on the sale of mortgages.
