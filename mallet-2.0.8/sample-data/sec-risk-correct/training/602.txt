The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been comparable to other similarly sized bank holding companies since trading on the Capital Market began in July 2001. Nevertheless, this trading volume does not compare with more seasoned companies listed on other stock exchanges. Thus, the market in our common stock is somewhat limited in scope relative to some other companies, which may impact the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares at a desirable price. In addition, we can provide no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for our stock will develop in the future.
