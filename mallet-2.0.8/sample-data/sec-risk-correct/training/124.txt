Changes in economic conditions may negatively impact the fees generated by our wealth management and trust business â€” Wealth management and trust fees are largely based on the size of client relationships and the market value of assets held under management. Changes in general economic conditions and in the financial and securities markets may negatively impact the value of our clients' wealth management accounts and the market value of assets held under management. Market declines, reductions in the value of our clients' accounts, and the loss of wealth management clients may negatively impact the fees generated by our wealth management and trust business and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
