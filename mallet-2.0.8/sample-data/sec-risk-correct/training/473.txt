Our shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors and on various other matters affecting our company. After the merger, our shareholders will hold a percentage ownership of the combined organization that is much smaller than such shareholderâ€™s current percentage ownership of Alliance. Accordingly, our shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of our company.
