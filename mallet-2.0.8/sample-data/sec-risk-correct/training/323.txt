We operate in a highly regulated industry, and both the Corporation and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller, and the FDIC. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors and the FDICâ€™s DIF rather than our shareholders.
