A significant percentage of our assets is secured by residential and commercial real estate mortgages. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, particularly decreases in real estate values. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments. If poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments may earn less income than real estate loans.
