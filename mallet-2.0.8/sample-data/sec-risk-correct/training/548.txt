The building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues. We opened a full-service banking center in Fishers, Indiana in October 2008, a second banking center in Carmel in December 2008 and a third in Westfield in May 2009. We also purchased property in Plainfield in 2008 with the expectation of building a new full-service banking center, but those plans were put on hold and the Bank is in the process of determining the appropriate time to begin construction based on its long-term expansion strategy. The Bank purchased two vacant banking centers in June 2013 located in Hamilton County, which is in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, and opened the Noblesville Office in September 2014 and the Fishers Crossing Office in November 2014. A Broad Ripple Banking Center, our first brick and mortar location in Marion County, is scheduled to open in mid-2015. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches a certain customer base.
