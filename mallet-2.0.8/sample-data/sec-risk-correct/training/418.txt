There are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic or credit market conditions in the markets where we operate as well as the State of New York and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic or credit market conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against us.
