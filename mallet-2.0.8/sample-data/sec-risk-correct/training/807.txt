Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are party to numerous legal proceedings, including class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due to the nature of these proceedings, the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or maximum liability for these actions. Developments in these unresolved matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) has brought suit against the United States challenging the government’s assistance of AIG, pursuant to which (i) AIG entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and (ii) the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership interest in AIG.  The United States has alleged that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any recoveries in these lawsuits.  A determination that the United States is liable for damages in such suits, together with a determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any such damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of the SICO litigation and other unresolved matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
