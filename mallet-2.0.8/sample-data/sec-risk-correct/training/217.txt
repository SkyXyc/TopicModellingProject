As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area and our lending territory. Consolidation and increasing competition may reduce or limit our margins, net interest income and our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
