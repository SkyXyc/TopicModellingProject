We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries â€” Our parent company, 1st Source Corporation, receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to our parent company. In the event our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to our parent company, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
