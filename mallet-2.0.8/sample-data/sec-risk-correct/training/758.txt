The performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates.   Our investment securities are subject to market risks and uncertainties. In particular, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary policy, domestic and international economic and political issues and other factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rates to rise, which would adversely affect the value of the fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to significant management judgment. For a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain market risk factors, see Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Market Risk Management. Furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through operating income and are therefore subject to significant volatility.  In an economic downturn or declining market, the reduction in our investment income due to decreases in the fair value of alternative investments could have a material adverse effect on operating income.
