Our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. Also, our only source of funds with which to pay dividends to our shareholders is dividends we receive from our Bank, and the Bankâ€™s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions. If these regulatory requirements are not satisfied, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock. We have paid quarterly cash dividends since our first cash dividend on February 24, 2006. We cannot guarantee that dividends will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods.
