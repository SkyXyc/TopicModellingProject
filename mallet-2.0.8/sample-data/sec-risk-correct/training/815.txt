We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The DOL has proposed a new regulation that could, if enacted as originally proposed, materially affect our ability to sell and service certain types of annuities and other investment products.  If the new DOL proposals are finalized as originally proposed, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to ERISA-covered plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis could be substantially limited compared to what is allowed under current law, and these changes could have a material impact on the types and levels of and compensation structures associated with the investment products and services we provide.  For additional information, see Item 1 – Business – Regulation and Item 7 – MD&A – Executive Overview – Consumer Insurance Strategic Initiatives and Outlook.
