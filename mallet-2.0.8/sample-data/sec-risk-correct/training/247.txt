Our interest-earning assets are heavily concentrated in mortgage loans secured by properties located in South and Central Florida. As of December 31, 2013, 71.3% of our loans secured by real estate were secured by commercial and residential properties located in Palm Beach, Miami-Dade, Broward, Hillsborough, Orange and Pasco Counties, Florida. The concentration of our loans in this region subjects us to risk that a downturn in the area economy, such as the one the area is currently experiencing, could result in a decrease in loan originations and an increase in delinquencies and foreclosures. As a result of this concentration, we may face greater risk than if our lending were more geographically diversified. In addition, since a large portion of our portfolio is secured by properties located in South and Central Florida, the occurrence of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties, and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us. We may suffer further losses due to the decline in the value of the properties underlying our mortgage loans, which would have an adverse impact on our operations.
