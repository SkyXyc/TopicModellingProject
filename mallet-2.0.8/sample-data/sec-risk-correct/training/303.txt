In addition to assessing the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of each of our borrowers, the Bank often secures loans with real estate collateral. At December 31, 2015, approximately 74% of our Bankâ€™s loans held for investment have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our net income and capital could be adversely affected.
