Further, in the event that we offer additional shares of our common stock in the future, our Articles of Incorporation do not provide shareholders with preemptive rights and such shares may be offered to investors other than our existing shareholders for prices at or below the then current market price of our common stock, all at the discretion of the Board. If we do sell additional shares of common stock to raise capital, the sale could reduce market price per share of common stock and dilute your ownership interest and such dilution could be substantial.
