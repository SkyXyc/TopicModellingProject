While we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, reserves may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net charge of $3.6 billion to strengthen our Non-Life Insurance Companies' loss reserves, reflecting adverse development in classes of business with long reporting tails, primarily in U.S. & Canada casualty, U.S. & Canada financial lines and run-off lines. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment duration, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including the judicial environment. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see Item 7.
