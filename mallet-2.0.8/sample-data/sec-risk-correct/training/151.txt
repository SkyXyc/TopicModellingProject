Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to record troubled loans acquired through acquisitions at fair value which may underestimate the actual performance of such loans. As a result, if these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the “discount”) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially appear higher. In 2013 and 2012, our net interest margins were increased by 1.56% (which 1.13% was due to the resolution of and changes in cash flows on acquired assets) and 1.50% (which 0.81% was due to the resolution of and changes in cash flows on acquired assets), respectively, because of these discount accretions. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margin and lower interest income in future periods.
