The Dodd-Frank Act also requires depository institution holding companies with assets greater than $500 million to be subject to capital requirements at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depository institutions, meaning, for instance, that such holding companies will no longer be able to count trust preferred securities issued on or after May 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital. The Dodd-Frank Act permits holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion to continue to count securities, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital if the securities qualified as Tier 1 capital on that date for the remaining life of the security. However, in its proposed capital rules, the Federal Reserve Board included a provision requiring bank holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion to phase-out the inclusion of trust preferred securities over a 10-year period. Holding companies with total consolidated assets of $15 billion or greater will be required to phase out existing trust preferred and other non-qualifying securities from Tier 1 capital over a 3-year period beginning on January 1, 2013. Moreover, agreements among bank regulators across the world (including the United States) known as the Basel III capital accord also call for the removal of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, encourage more reliance on common equity as the main component of capital, and call for increased levels of capital. Rules implementing Basel III have been proposed in the United States and are still pending.
