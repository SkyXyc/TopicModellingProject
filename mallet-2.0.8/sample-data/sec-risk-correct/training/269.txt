The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts and they may not cover our common stock. If securities research analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we are covered by securities analysts and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which would cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
