Certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and applicable Virginia corporate and banking law may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of our company even if such a transaction is favored by some of our shareholders and could result in shareholders receiving a substantial premium over the current market price of our shares.  The primary purpose of these provisions is to encourage negotiations with our management by persons interested in acquiring control of our Corporation.  These provisions may also tend to perpetuate present management and make it difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of the shares to be able to elect even a single director.
