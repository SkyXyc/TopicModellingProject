Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation.  We cannot predict the impact laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows.  It is possible such laws and regulations, the impact of our designation as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), our status as an Internationally Active Insurance Group (IAIG) and certain initiatives by the FSB and the IAIS, including, but not limited to, the application of HLA capital and the ongoing development of an ICS, and implementation of Solvency II in the European Union, may significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs.  It is possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions including the United States.
