Management of each of our subsidiary banks maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses based upon, among other things, (1) historical experience, (2) an evaluation of local and national economic conditions, (3) regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, (4) current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans, (5) the existence and effect of concentrations of credit, (6) growth rates in the loan portfolio and (7) results of regulatory examinations. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the respective loan portfolios. Although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses at each of the subsidiary banks is adequate, there can be no assurance that such allowances will prove sufficient to cover future losses. Future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ or adverse developments arise with respect to nonperforming or performing loans. Material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a material decrease in our net income, and possibly our capital, and could result in the inability to pay dividends, among other adverse consequences.
