Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In their primary market areas, our subsidiary banks compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than our subsidiary banks and may offer certain services that our subsidiary banks do not or cannot provide. Additionally, some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same regulations that govern Alabama National or the Banks and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Our profitability depends upon the subsidiary banksâ€™ continued ability to compete effectively in their market areas.
