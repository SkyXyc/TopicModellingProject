The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. We are subject, in certain respects, to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Alabama State Banking Department, the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Georgia State Banking Department. Our success depends not only on competitive factors but also on state and federal regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, not stockholders. The ultimate effect of recent and proposed changes to the regulation of the financial institution industry cannot be predicted. Regulations now affecting us may be modified at any time, and there is no assurance that such modifications, if any, will not adversely affect our business.
