Our profitability depends significantly on the general economic conditions of Upstate New York and the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Upstate New York counties of Cortland, Erie, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego and nearby counties. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities or credit markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
