Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations.
