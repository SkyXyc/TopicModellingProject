Due to the relatively close proximity of our geographic markets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded. Specifically, due to the nature of our markets, a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 66.8% and 15.8% of our $1.1 billion loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate and residential real estate (including home equity loans), respectively. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 3.1% of total loans were secured by property under construction and land development.
