Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks.  A failure in or breach of the Company’s operational or information security systems, or those of the Company’s third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses.  As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect the Company’s systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company.
