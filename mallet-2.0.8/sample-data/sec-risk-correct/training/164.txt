Economic conditions began deteriorating during the latter half of 2007 and have not fully recovered since that time. Although economic conditions are improving, business activity across a wide range of industries and regions, including South and Central Florida, has been greatly reduced. While unemployment in the U.S. and our market areas has begun to improve, unemployment remains elevated compared to recent historical levels prior to 2007. As a result of this economic crisis, many lending institutions, including us, have experienced declines in the performance of their loans, including construction, land development and land loans, commercial loans and consumer loans. Moreover, competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. Loan demand has not returned to pre-recession levels. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages declined during the recession, and despite recent increasing property values in our markets, prices have not fully recovered. Overall, the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business, and the environment may not improve in the near term. Accordingly, unless and until conditions improve, our business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected.
