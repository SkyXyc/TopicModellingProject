We use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely, and we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates. When rates change, we expect to record a gain or loss on derivatives that would be offset by an inverse change in the value of loans held for sale and mortgage-related securities. We utilize a third party consulting firm to manage our hedging activities and we typically hedge 80% of our loan pipeline and 100% of our loans being warehoused. The derivative financial instruments used to hedge the interest rate risk of our loan pipeline and warehoused loans are forward sales of 15 year and 30 year mortgage backed securities. The notional amount and fair value of these derivatives are disclosed in Note 8 of the financial statements.
