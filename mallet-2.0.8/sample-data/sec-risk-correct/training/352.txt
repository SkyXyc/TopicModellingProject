Among many other contributing factors, the recent recession was triggered by instability of financial institutions and large measures of volatility and fear in the financial markets. This financial instability led to an economic downturn and current stagnant recovery which, in turn, has harmed the financial condition and performance of our small to medium sized business target market. If despite such laws, regulations, and programs the financial markets again destabilize, or recent financial market conditions deteriorate rather than continuing to improve or remain steady, the financial condition of our small to medium sized business target market would suffer and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock.
