We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices. We must also meet regulatory capital requirements. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” for regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our cost of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, and our ability to make acquisitions.
