Our reserve for loan and lease losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses in our loan and lease portfolio — In the financial services industry, there is always a risk that certain borrowers may not repay borrowings. The determination of the appropriate level of the reserve for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Our reserve for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover the loan and lease losses that we may actually incur. If we experience defaults by borrowers in any of our businesses, our earnings could be negatively affected. Changes in local economic conditions could adversely affect credit quality, particularly in our local business loan and lease portfolio. Changes in national or international economic conditions could also adversely affect the quality of our loan and lease portfolio and negate, to some extent, the benefits of national or international diversification through our Specialty Finance Group’s portfolio. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our reserve for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan or lease charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours.
