Our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2013 has been designated as available-for-sale pursuant to U.S. GAAP relating to accounting for investments. Such principles require that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale portfolio be “marked to market” and reflected as a separate item in shareholders’ equity (net of tax) as accumulated other comprehensive income.
