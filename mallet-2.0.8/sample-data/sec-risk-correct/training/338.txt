Currently, we generally sell all of the mortgage loans originated by the Mortgage Division. We only underwrite mortgages that we reasonably expect will have more than one potential purchaser. The profitability of our Mortgage Division depends in large part upon our ability to originate or purchase a high volume of loans and to quickly sell them in the secondary market. Thus, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to sell loans into that market.
