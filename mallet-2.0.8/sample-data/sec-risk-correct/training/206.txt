A substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to Latin America and, as a result, we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions in Latin America. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $269.5 million of our deposits were from foreign nationals whose primary residence is Latin America. U.S. and global economic policies, political or political tension, and global economic conditions may adversely impact the Latin American economies. If economic conditions in Latin America change, we could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to Latin America.
