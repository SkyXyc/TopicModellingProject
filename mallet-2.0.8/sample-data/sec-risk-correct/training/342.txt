The Mortgage Division makes representations and warranties that loans sold to investors meet their programâ€™s guidelines and that the information provided by the borrowers is accurate and complete and that the loan documents are complete and executed by the borrowers. In the event of a default on a loan sold, the investor may make a claim for losses due to document deficiencies, program compliance, early payment default, and fraud or borrower misrepresentations. The Mortgage Division maintains a reserve in other liabilities for potential losses on mortgage loans sold. Net income may be impacted if this reserve is insufficient to cover claims from the investors.
