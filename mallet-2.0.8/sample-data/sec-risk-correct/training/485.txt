As noted above, the Consent Order requires the Bank to create and implement a capital plan. The Bank has twice submitted capital restoration plans that have been rejected by the OCC and there is no assurance it will be able to submit an acceptable plan. Moreover, the condition of the Bank’s loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate in the current economic environment and thus continue to deplete the Bank’s capital and other financial resources. Therefore, should the Bank fail to implement an acceptable CRP and comply with its terms, or fail to comply with capital and liquidity funding requirements, or suffer a continued deterioration in its financial condition, the Bank may be subject to being placed into a federal conservatorship or receivership by the OCC, with the FDIC appointed as conservator or receiver. If these events occur, AMCORE probably would suffer a complete loss of the value of its ownership interest in the Bank, and the Company subsequently may be exposed to significant claims by the FDIC and the OCC.
