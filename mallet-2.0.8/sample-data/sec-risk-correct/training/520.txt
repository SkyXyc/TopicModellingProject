Transaction/operation risk is a function of internal controls, information systems, employee integrity and operating processes. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal processes, controls, staff or systems could lead to impairment of liquidity, financial loss, disruption of the business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or damage to the Company’s reputation. For example, the Company is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. Failure of financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and controls to operate properly, becoming disabled, or to keep pace with increasing volumes, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to capture, process and accurately report these transactions.
