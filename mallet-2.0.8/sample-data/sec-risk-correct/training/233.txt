A major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. Our interest-earning assets include outstanding loans extended to our customers and securities held in our investment portfolio. We fund assets using deposits and other borrowings. Our goal has been to maintain non-interest-bearing deposits in the range of 15% to 25% of total deposits, and, as of December 31, 2013 we maintained approximately 34% of deposits as non-interest bearing.
