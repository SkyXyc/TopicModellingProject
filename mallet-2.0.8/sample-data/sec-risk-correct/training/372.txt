We offer residential and commercial construction programs for builders and developers, which constituted 34.8% of our loan portfolio as of DecemberÂ 31, 2006. Builder construction loans are considered more risky than other types of real estate loans. While we believe we have established adequate reserves to cover the credit risk associated with our construction loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our reserves, which could adversely affect our earnings.
