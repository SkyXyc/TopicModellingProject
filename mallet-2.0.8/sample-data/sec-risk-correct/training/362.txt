As of December 31, 2015, our chairman of the board, executive officers and directors and one other principal shareholder collectively beneficially owned approximately 30.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Our executive officers and directors collectively beneficially owned approximately 23.6% of our common stock and one other individual shareholder has declared beneficial ownership of an additional 7.1% of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may allow our directors, acting in their role as substantial shareholders, to exert a major influence over the election of their nominees as directors, especially if voting together with our officers and other significant shareholders. Our directors, officers, and major shareholders could exercise similar influence over other corporate actions that require a shareholder vote, including change in control transactions.
