Our officers, directors and principal shareholders, together with their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 41% of our voting shares. As a result, these few shareholders, even if they do not act in concert, will exert significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, as well as any charter amendment and other matters requiring shareholder approval. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control and may have a negative impact on the market price of the Company’s common stock by discouraging third party investors. In addition, the interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of the Company’s other shareholders.
