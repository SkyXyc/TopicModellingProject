We target our commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and, therefore, may be more vulnerable in an economic downturn. If general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which we operate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, the success of a small or medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on the business and its ability to repay a loan.
