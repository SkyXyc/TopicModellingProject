The Company and the Bank continue to diligently work with their financial and professional advisors in seeking qualified sources of outside capital, and in achieving compliance with the requirements of the Consent Order, the FRB Agreement, the Letter and the Response Letter. The Company and the Bank continue to consult with the OCC, FRB and FDIC on a regular basis concerning the Company’s and Bank’s proposals to obtain outside capital and to develop action plans that will be acceptable to federal regulatory authorities, but there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful, or that even if one or more of the Company’s and Bank’s proposals are accepted by the Company’s and Bank’s Federal regulators, that these proposals will be successfully implemented. While Company’s management continues to exert maximum effort to attract new capital, significant operating losses in 2008 and 2009, significant levels of criticized assets and low levels of capital raise substantial doubt as to Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern was previously disclosed in the Company’s December 31, 2009 earnings release furnished with its February 2, 2010 Form 8-K, Current Report. If the Company is unable to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Consent Order, the FRB Agreement, the Letter and the Response Letter with the OCC and the FRB, or an acceptable CRP under the OCC’s Prompt Corrective Action guidelines, and if the Company cannot otherwise comply with such commitments and regulations, the OCC could force a sale, liquidation or federal conservatorship or receivership of the Bank.
