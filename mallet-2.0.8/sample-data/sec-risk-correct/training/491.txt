Recent negative developments in the financial industry and credit markets may continue to adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. There is no precise method of predicting loan losses, and therefore there is a risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will otherwise be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would cause results of operations to decline in the period(s) in which such additions occur and could also have a material adverse impact on the Company’s capital and financial position. For further information regarding provisions for loan losses, concentrations, credit losses, and non-performing loans, see the discussion of provision for loan losses, and the Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management section of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
