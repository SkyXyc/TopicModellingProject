We currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks.Â  Further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited. As a result, we rely heavily on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the United States. TRIPRA was reauthorized in January 2015 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. Under TRIPRA, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a deductible equal to 20 percent of our commercial property and casualty insurance premiums for covered lines for the prior calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for losses in excess of our deductible, starting at 85 percent of losses in 2015, and reducing by one percentage point each year, ending at 80 percent in 2020, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion. TRIPRA does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as consumer property and consumer casualty.
