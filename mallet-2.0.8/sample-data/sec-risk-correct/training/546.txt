Our cost of operations is high relative to our assets. Our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits. Our operating expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, furniture and equipment expense, professional fees, data processing expense, FDIC insurance premiums and assessments, and marketing, totaled $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, with $614,000 of the $1.1 million increase related to a prepayment penalty paid to the Federal Home Loan Bank. Newer banking centers in the Indianapolis metropolitan area that have not yet become profitable are currently having a negative impact on our efficiency ratio. The Company’s efficiency ratio totaled 82.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 81.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Failure to control our expenses could hurt future profits.
