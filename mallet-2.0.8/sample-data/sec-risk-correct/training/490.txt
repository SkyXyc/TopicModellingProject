Credit risk in the Bankâ€™s portfolio is high due to a concentration in commercial real estate loans with significant deterioration in asset quality and collateral values. The value of real estate collateral supporting many construction and land development loans, commercial loans and multi-family loans have declined and may continue to decline. Extensions of credit for these types of loans has generally ceased, and AMCORE is working actively to manage its remaining construction and development and commercial real estate loan portfolios. However, AMCORE could experience further delinquencies and credit losses in these challenging economic times, if current trends in housing and real estate markets continue to deteriorate, and if efforts to limit losses through workouts of bad loans are unsuccessful.
