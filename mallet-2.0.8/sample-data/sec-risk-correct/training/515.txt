Due to the impact on the FDIC insurance fund resulting from the recent increase in bank failures, the FDIC raised its insurance premiums and levied special assessments on all financial institutions. In addition, the FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC places all financial institutions into one of four risk categories using a two-step process based first on the respective institution’s capital ratios and then on the CAMELS composite supervisory rating assigned to the institution by its primary federal regulator in connection with its periodic regulatory examinations. As of December 31, 2009, the Bank is “significantly undercapitalized” under regulatory guidelines. Due to the “significantly undercapitalized” status of the Bank and other factors indicating higher risk, the FDIC will charge the Bank a higher premium for deposit insurance. The combination of the general increase in FDIC insurance rates and higher FDIC insurance rates resulting from the classification of the Bank in a higher risk category will have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the impact in future periods in the event the economic crisis continues or the Bank continues to be deemed “significantly undercapitalized”.
