The primary risks related to our hedging activities relate to incorrect assumptions regarding pull through and the amount of the pipeline being hedged. A hedging policy and hedging management committee are in place to control, monitor and manage risks associated with our hedging activity. The hedging policy quantifies risk tolerance thresholds that ensure the economic risk taken is not material to the Corporation’s financial condition or operating performance. See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” and “Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
