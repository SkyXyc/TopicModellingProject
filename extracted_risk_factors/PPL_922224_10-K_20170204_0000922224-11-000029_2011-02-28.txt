PART I




ITEM 1. BUSINESS




BACKGROUND




PPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown, PA, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994.  Through subsidiaries, PPL generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern U.S., markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in northeastern and northwestern portions of the U.S., delivers electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee and the U.K. and delivers natural gas in Kentucky.  On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.  Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE).  LKE is engaged in regulated uti
lity operations through its subsidiaries, KU and LG&E.  PPL acquired LKE for approximately $7.6 billion, including debt assumed through consolidation.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition.  The acquisition of LKE substantially reapportions the mix of PPL's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens PPL's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability.  An increase in regulated assets provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover costs of capital investments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions.  In 2011, PPL projects that 50% of its net income will be provided by its regulated businesses and the remainder will be provided by its c
ompetitive supply businesses.  As of December 31, 2010, PPL has:




 





·  


More than $10 billion in projected annual revenues (up from $8.5 billion recorded by PPL in 2010 including two months of LKE revenue).




 





·  


5.3 million utility customers (including 1.3 million served by the Kentucky-based companies).




 





·  


Approximately 19,000 MW of generation (including 7,700 MW of regulated capacity in the Kentucky-based companies).




 





·  


Approximately 14,000 full-time employees (including about 3,100 in Kentucky).




 




As of December 31, 2010, PPL's principal subsidiaries are shown below (* denotes a SEC registrant):

 






In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.




In addition to PPL Corporation, the other SEC registrants included in this filing are:




PPL Energy Supply, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PPL formed in 2000, is an energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in the generation and marketing of electricity, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern power markets of the U.S. and in the delivery of electricity in the U.K.  PPL Energy Supply's major operating subsidiaries are PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Global.  As noted above, in January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Energy Supply owned or controlled 11,729 MW of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in Pennsylvania
 and Montana to provide 247 MW of additional generating capacity by 2013, and is in the process of disposing of certain non-core generation facilities with a capacity of 961 MW in 2011.




PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, incorporated in 1920, is a direct subsidiary of PPL and a regulated public utility.  PPL Electric delivers electricity in its Pennsylvania service territory and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act.




PPL's utility subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent certain of its non-utility subsidiaries, are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC including:  wholesale sales of power and related transactions, electric transmission service, accounting practices, issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of utility properties and payments of dividends.  PPL is subject to certain FERC regulations as a holding company under PUHCA 2005 and the Federal Power Act, including with respect to accounting and record-keeping, inter-system sales of non-power goods and services and acquisitions of securities in, or mergers with, certain types of electric utility companies or holding companies.




Segment Information




(PPL)




Following the November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, PPL is organized into four segments:  Kentucky Regulated, International Regulated (formerly International Delivery), Pennsylvania Regulated (formerly Pennsylvania Delivery) and Supply.  Other than PPL adding a Kentucky Regulated segment, there were no other changes to reportable segments except the renaming of segments and allocating interest expense related to the Equity Units to the Kentucky Regulated segment.




(PPL Energy Supply)




At December 31, 2010, PPL Energy Supply's segments consisted of Supply and International Regulated (formerly International Delivery).  In 2010, there were no changes to these segments except the renaming of segments.  However, in January of 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.




(PPL Electric)




PPL Electric operates in a single business segment.




(PPL, PPL Energy Supply, and PPL Electric)

Kentucky Regulated Segment


  
  

  

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU.  The Kentucky Regulated segment also includes interest expense related to the Equity Units issued in June 2010 to partially finance the acquisition of LKE.







LKE became a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL on November 1, 2010.  LG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee.  KU provides electric service to approximately 514,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, to approximately 30,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia and less than ten customers in Tennessee.  In Virginia, KU operates under the name Old Dominion Power Company.  KU also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in Kentucky.  LG&E provides electric service to approximately 395,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties.  
LG&E provides natural gas service to approximately 320,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky.







  

PPL Acquisition







In September 2010, the KPSC approved a settlement agreement among PPL and all of the intervening parties to PPL's joint application to the KPSC for approval of its acquisition of ownership and control of LKE.  In the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that LG&E and KU would commit that no base rate increases would take effect before January 1, 2013.  The rate increases for LG&E and KU that took effect on August 1, 2010 (as described below) are not impacted by the settlement.  Under the terms of the settlement, LG&E and KU retain the right to seek approval for the deferral of "extraordinary and uncontrollable costs."  Interim rate adjustments will continue to be permissible during that period through existing fuel, environmental and demand side management recovery mechanisms. &
#160;The agreement also substitutes an acquisition savings shared deferral mechanism for the previous requirement that LG&E and KU file a synergies plan with the KPSC post-closing.  This mechanism, which will be in place until the earlier of five years or the first day of the year in which a base rate increase becomes effective, permits LG&E and KU to each earn up to a 10.75% return on equity.  Any earnings above a 10.75% return on equity will be shared with customers on a 50%/50% basis.  The KPSC Order and the settlement agreement contained a number of other commitments by LG&E and KU with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters.




In October 2010, both the VSCC and the TRA approved the transfer of control of LKE to PPL.  Certain of these Orders contained additional commitments with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters.




Also in October 2010, the FERC approved the application for the transfer of control of the utilities.  The approval includes various conditional commitments, such as a continuation of certain existing undertakings with protesters in prior cases, an agreement not to terminate certain KU municipal customer contracts prior to January 2017, an exclusion of any transaction-related costs from wholesale energy and tariff customer rates to the extent that LG&E and KU have agreed to not seek recovery of the same transaction-related cost from retail customers and agreements to coordinate with protesters in certain open or ongoing matters.







  

Franchises and Licenses







LG&E and KU provide electric delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their various service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. 







  

Competition







There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LKE.  Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky.  The nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted.  Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation which implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation; KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.




Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of LKE.  Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users.  Approximately 25% of LG&E's annual throughput is purchased by large commercial and industrial customers directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through LG&E's distribution system.  LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability.  However, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or 
other natural gas distribution systems.




In April 2010, the KPSC commenced a proceeding to investigate the regulatory, financial and operational aspects of natural gas retail competition programs, and the potential benefits to Kentucky consumers.  A number of entities, including LG&E, were parties to the proceeding.  In December 2010, the KPSC issued an Order in the proceeding declining to endorse natural gas competition at the retail level, noting the existence of a number of transition or oversight costs and an uncertain level of economic benefits in such programs.  With respect to existing natural gas transportation programs available to large commercial or industrial users, the Order indicates that the KPSC will review utilities' current tariff structures, user thresholds and other terms and conditions of such programs, as part of such utili
ties' next regular natural gas rate cases.







  

Electric Operations







LKE serves approximately 939,000 electric customers.  LKE's transmission and distribution system territory covers approximately 7,300 square miles.  For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, 83% of the Kentucky Regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from electric operations.  Details of electric revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010 are shown below.

Power Supply







At December 31, 2010, LKE owned, controlled or had ownership interest in generating capacity (winter rating) of 7,933 MW in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio.  See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of LKE's generating capacity.  For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, LKE's power plants generated 6,008 GWh of electricity.




During 2010, approximately 95% of the electricity generated by LG&E, and 98% of that generated by KU, was produced by their coal-fired electric generating stations.  The remainder was generated by natural gas and oil-fired combustion turbines and hydroelectric power plants.  Also during 2010, substantially all of the electricity generated was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base.




See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" and Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Unit 2 of the Trimble County generating station (TC2).  With limited exceptions LKE took care, custody and control of TC2 on January 22, 2011, and has dispatched the unit to meet customer demand since that date.  LG&E and KU and the contractor agreed to a further amendment of the construction agreement whereby the contractor will complete certain actions relating to identifying and completing any necessary modifications to allow operation of TC2 on all fuels in accordance with initial specifications prior to certain dates, and amending the provisions relating to liquidat
ed damages. LKE cannot currently estimate the ultimate outcome of these matters.  LKE owns a 75% interest in Unit 2.  Unit 2 is coal-fired and has a capacity of 760 MW, of which LKE's share is 570 MW.







  

Fuel Supply







Coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E and KU for baseload generation for the foreseeable future, with natural gas and oil being used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.




Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units.  Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.




LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2016 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases.




For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western and eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, southern Indiana, southern Illinois and Ohio.  With the installation of flue gas desulfurization systems (sulfur dioxide removal systems, or scrubbers), LG&E and KU expect their use of higher sulfur coal to increase.  In 2011 and beyond, LG&E and KU may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Unit 2 of the Trimble County generating station.  Coal is delivered to the generating stations primarily by barge, truck and rail.







  

Natural Gas







LG&E purchases, transports, distributes or stores natural gas for 320,000 customers in Kentucky.  Its service area covers over 700 square miles in 17 counties and includes 391 miles of transportation mains, consisting of natural gas transmission lines of 255 miles, natural gas storage lines of 119 miles and natural gas combustion turbine lines of 17 miles.  LG&E's natural gas distribution system includes 4,235 miles of distribution mains. For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, 17% of the Kentucky Regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from natural gas operations.  Shown below are details of natural gas revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010.

LG&E's natural gas billings include a weather normalization adjustment mechanism which adjusts the distribution cost component of residential and commercial customer bills based on normal temperatures during the heating season months of November through April, somewhat mitigating the effect of above- or below-normal weather on residential and commercial revenues.




Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 Bcf, help provide economical and reliable natural gas service to ultimate consumers.  By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads.  Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal the following winter heating season.  Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be forced to buy additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and when the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest.  Several suppliers under contracts of varying duration prov
ide competitively priced natural gas. The underground storage facilities, in combination with its purchasing practices, enable LG&E to offer natural gas sales service at competitive rates.  At December 31, 2010, LG&E had a 12 Bcf inventory balance of natural gas stored underground valued at $60 million.




A number of large commercial and industrial customers purchase their natural gas requirements directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through LG&E's distribution system.  These large commercial and industrial customers account for approximately 25% of LG&E's annual throughput.







  

Natural Gas Supply







LG&E also has a portfolio of supply arrangements of various terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations.  These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive.  In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.




LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines.  LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2013 and 2018.  Total winter capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer on-demand natural gas capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day.  LG&E has a contract with the other pipeline that expires in 2012.  Total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 51,000 MMBtu/day.







  

Rates and Regulation







LG&E and KU are subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC in virtually all matters related to electric and natural gas utility regulation.  In addition, KU is subject to the VSCC and the TRA.  LG&E and KU withdrew from the MISO in 2006.  Since exiting from the MISO, LG&E and KU have been operating under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.  LG&E and KU now contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. to function as their independent transmission operator, pursuant to FERC requirements.  Certain operations of LKE are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.  LKE is subject to certain FERC regulations as a holding comp
any under PUHCA 2005 and the Federal Power Act.




LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and notes payable) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and environmental compliance costs recovered separately through the environmental cost recovery (ECR) mechanism.  As such, regulatory assets are generally earning a return.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.




KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base.  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates.  In January 2011, KU filed a notice of intent to file a rate case with the VSCC for the test year ended December 31, 2010.  The case is expected to be filed on or after April 1, 2011.




KU's wholesale requirements rates for municipal customers are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates.




See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.




2010 Kentucky Rate Case




In January 2010, LG&E and KU filed applications with the KPSC requesting increases in electric base rates of approximately 12%, or annual increases of $95 million and $135 million, respectively.  In addition, LG&E requested an increase in its natural gas base rates of approximately 8%, or $23 million annually.  In June 2010, LG&E and KU and certain intervenors agreed to a stipulation providing for increases in LG&E's and KU's electric base rates of $74 million and $98 million on an annual basis, and LG&E's natural gas base rates of $17 million on an annual basis, and those parties filed a request with the KPSC to approve such stipulation.  In July 2010, the KPSC issued an Order in the proceeding approving all the provisions of the stipulation, including a return on equity range of 9.75-10.
75%, with rates effective on and after August 1, 2010.




Virginia Rate Case




In June 2009, KU filed an application with the VSCC requesting an increase in electric base rates for its Virginia jurisdictional customers in an amount of $12 million annually or approximately 21%.  The proposed increase reflected a proposed rate of return on rate base of 8.586% based on a return of equity of 12%.  As permitted pursuant to a VSCC Order, KU elected to implement the proposed rates effective November 1, 2009, on an interim basis.  During December 2009, KU and the VSCC Staff agreed to a Stipulation and Recommendation authorizing a base rate revenue increase of $11 million annually and a return on rate base of 7.846% based on a 10.5% return on common equity.  In March 2010, the VSCC issued an Order approving the stipulation, with the increased rates to be put into effect as of April 1, 
2010.  As part of the stipulation, KU refunded approximately $1 million in interim rate amounts in excess of the ultimate approved rates.




FERC Wholesale Rate Case




In 2008, KU filed an application with the FERC for increases in electric base rates applicable to wholesale power sale contracts or interchange agreements involving, collectively, twelve Kentucky municipalities.  The application requested a shift from an all-in stated unit charge rate to an unbundled formula rate, including an annual adjustment mechanism.  In 2009, the FERC issued an Order approving a settlement among the parties in the case, incorporating increases of approximately 3% from prior rates and a return on equity of 11%.  In May 2010, KU submitted to the FERC the proposed current annual adjustments to the formula rates, which incorporated certain proposed increases.  Updated rates, including certain further adjustments from a review process involving wholesale requirements customers, bec
ame effective as of July 1, 2010.

International Regulated Segment


  
  

  

Includes WPD, a regulated electricity distribution company in the U.K.







WPD, headquartered in Bristol, England, operates two of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.  WPD (South West) serves 1.5 million end-users in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest England.  WPD (South Wales) serves 1.1 million end-users in a 4,550 square mile area within Wales.

WPD's energy-related businesses revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunications and real estate.  WPD's telecommunication subsidiary derives revenue from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to WPD's overhead electricity distribution network.  WPD also provides meter services to businesses across the U.K.







  

Franchise and Licenses







WPD is authorized by the U.K. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations.  For instance, WPD is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.







  

Competition







Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network.  WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) are thus regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls.







  

Rates and Regulation







The operations of WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) are regulated under their distribution licenses under which income is generated subject to a price cap regulatory framework set by the regulatory body, Ofgem, that provides economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs.  The charges made for the use of the distribution networks are regulated on the basis of the "RPI plus/minus X" formula where RPI is a measure of inflation and X is an efficiency factor established by Ofgem following their review.  Under the review, Ofgem assesses the revenue and capital expenditure plans of companies and determines what they consider an efficient level of that expenditure.  Ofgem also considers the required cost of capital sufficient to encourage the required investment and determines customer s
ervice targets.  In December 2009, Ofgem completed its rate review for the period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015.  Ofgem allowed WPD an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 6.9% in each of the five years.  The revenue increase includes reimbursement to electricity distributors for higher operating and capital costs to be incurred.  Also, Ofgem set the weighted average cost of capital at 4.7%, which includes pre-tax debt and post-tax equity costs and excludes adjustments for inflation, for all distribution companies.  This is a 0.8% decrease from the previous regulatory period.  Additionally, Ofgem has established strong incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability or customer service.  In October 2010, Ofgem announced a new pricing model that will be effective for the electricity distribution sector, inclu
ding WPD, beginning April 2015.  The model, known as RIIO (Revenues = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), is intended to encourage investment in regulated infrastructure.  Key components of the model are: an extension of the price review period to eight years, increased emphasis on outputs and incentives, enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers, a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation, expansion of the current Low Carbon Network Fund to stimulate innovation and continued use of a single weighted average cost of capital.







  

Customers







The majority of WPD's revenue is derived from the delivery of electricity to end-users and thus its customers are the suppliers to those end-users.  It is a requirement of Ofgem that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement.  This agreement sets out how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to provide collateral.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment


  
  

  

Includes the regulated electric delivery operations of PPL Electric.







PPL Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act.  PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central Pennsylvania.

Franchise,  Licenses and Other Regulations







PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC.  PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions.  In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.




Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.







  

Competition







Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated transmission and distribution monopoly in its service area.  Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity transmission and distribution businesses.







  

Rates and Regulation







Transmission and Distribution




PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.




PJM serves as a FERC-approved RTO to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves.  Besides operating the electric transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.  A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets.  Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities.  PPL Electric is entitled to fully recover from customers the charges that it pays to PJM for transmission-related services.




In November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard Act (the AEPS), which requires electric distribution companies and retail electric suppliers to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from alternative energy sources by 2020.  Under this state law, alternative energy sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells.  If an electric distribution company is unable to meet these targets, it will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 (or, in the case of solar, 200% of the average market value of solar credits) for each MWh that it is short.  PPL Electric's initial compliance obligation covered the period January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2010.  PPL Electric was required to supply about 6.7% of the t
otal amount of electricity it delivered to its PLR customers from alternative energy sources during this period.  Under the PUC-approved Competitive Bridge Plan, PPL Electric obtained full requirements service that included the generation or credits that PPL Electric needed to comply with the AEPS in 2010.  AEPS compliance requirements for June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011 are about 9% of the total amount of electricity delivered to PLR Customers.




Act 129 became effective in October 2008.  The law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, establishes new PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing AEPS.




See "Regulatory Issues - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and PPL Electric's actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009.




PLR




The Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, to act as a PLR of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations established by the PUC.  As part of the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009.  To mitigate the risk that PPL Electric would not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the "capped" rates, PPL Electric entered into full-requirement energy supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation through the end of 2009.  Under these contracts, PPL EnergyPlus supplied PPL Electric's entire PLR load at predetermined prices equal to the capped generation rates that PPL Electric wa
s authorized to charge its customers.  Prior to the expiration of the rate caps, PPL Electric's customers had limited incentive to purchase generation supply from other providers because, in recent years, the contracts between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus provided a below-market price for these customers.  As a result, a limited amount of "shopping" occurred.




PPL Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 is governed by the PUC pursuant to the Public Utility Code as amended by Act 129, PLR regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations.  Effective January 1, 2010, PPL Electric's cost of electric generation is based on a competitive solicitation process.  The PUC has approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period January 2011 through May 2013 which includes 14 solicitations for supply beginning January 1, 2011 with a portion extending beyond May 2013.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric had contracted for all of the 2010 electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service in 2010. 
0;In addition, PPL Electric completed two solicitations in 2009 and four solicitations in 2010 for supply starting January 2011 to May 2015.  The solicitations include a mix of long-term and short-term purchases ranging from five months to five years to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide for customer supply as a PLR.  See "Energy Purchase Commitments" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL Electric's solicitations for 2011 and its actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2011.




In addition, several alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service territory.  Whether its customers purchase supply from these alternative suppliers or from PPL Electric as a PLR, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of PPL Electric.  The cost to purchase PLR supply is passed directly by PPL Electric to its customers without markup.




2010 Rate Case




In March 2010, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase distribution rates by approximately $115 million or approximately 2.4% over PPL Electric's projected 2010 revenues, to be effective January 1, 2011.  In December 2010, the PUC approved a settlement filed by the parties that provides for a rate increase of $77.5 million, or 1.6%, over PPL Electric's projected 2010 revenues.  The approved rates became effective for service rendered on and after January 1, 2011.  In January 2011, the PP&L Industrial Customers Alliance (PPLICA) filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the PUC's order regarding PPLICA's proposal for a special rate schedule for certain large commercial and industrial customers.  Also in January 2011, the PUC granted reconsideration for the purpose of evaluating the me
rits of the petition.  PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation.

The Supply segment's energy-related businesses revenues include activities that primarily support its generation, marketing and trading businesses.  These activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers, through its mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries.  The renewable energy business builds, owns, operates and maintains renewable energy facilities throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, and includes solar, wind and landfill gas to energy plants.  At December 31, 2010, the renewable energy business owned and operated 33 MW of renewable capacity.  The revenues of the mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries are included in "Energy-related businesses" on the Statements of Inc
ome.







  

Customer Choice Act







In 1996, the Customer Choice Act was enacted to restructure Pennsylvania's electric utility industry in order to create retail access to a competitive market for generation of electricity.  The Customer Choice Act required each Pennsylvania electric utility to file a restructuring plan to "unbundle" its rates into separate generation, transmission and distribution components and to permit its customers to directly access alternate suppliers of electricity.  Under the Customer Choice Act, regulated utilities were required to act as a PLR.  As part of a settlement approved by the PUC, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric entered into full requirements energy supply agreements at predetermined "capped" rates through the end of 2009.




With the expiration of the long-term power purchase agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, PPL EnergyPlus has multiple options as to how, and to whom, it sells the electricity produced by PPL Energy Supply's generation plants.  These sales are based on prevailing market rates.  The expiration of the long-term supply agreements with PPL Electric also enables PPL Energy Supply to adjust its exposure to fluctuations in demand that existed with supplying PPL Electric's PLR load.  Entry of new generation suppliers into the Pennsylvania marketplace provides PPL Energy Supply the opportunity to provide generation supply to additional wholesale customers but also exposes the Supply segment to increased competition (see "Competition" below).







  

Power Supply







PPL Energy Supply owned or controlled generating capacity (winter rating) of 11,729 MW at December 31, 2010.  Through subsidiaries, PPL Generation owns and operates power plants in Pennsylvania, Montana, Illinois and Connecticut.  Generating capacity controlled by PPL Generation and other PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through PPL EnergyPlus' tolling or power purchase agreements (including Ironwood and other facilities that consist of NUGs, wind farms and landfill gas facilities).  See "Item 2. Properties - Supply Segment" for a complete listing of PPL Energy Supply's generating capacity.




See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information on the 2010 sale of the Long Island Generation business, consisting of plants in New York and the 2010 and 2009 sales of hydroelectric facilities located in Maine.  Also, see Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information on the anticipated sale of certain non-core generation facilities consisting of natural gas-fired facilities in Wallingford, Connecticut and University Park, Illinois and a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary's interest in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in Conestoga, Pennsylvania.




PPL Energy Supply's generation subsidiaries are EWGs, which sell electricity into wholesale markets.  EWGs are subject to regulation by the FERC, which has authorized these EWGs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices.  This electricity is sold to PPL EnergyPlus under FERC-jurisdictional power purchase agreements.




PPL Susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of the Susquehanna nuclear units.  Certain of PPL Energy Supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices.  Certain operations of PPL Generation's subsidiaries are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.




The system capacity of PPL Energy Supply's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.




During 2010, PPL Energy Supply's power plants, excluding renewable facilities that are discussed separately below, generated the following amounts of electricity.

(a)


15 million kWhs were excluded as tolling agreements were in place for 100% of the output.







This generation represented a 4% increase above 2009 output.  Of this generation, 50% of the electricity generated was from coal-fired stations, 29% from the Susquehanna nuclear station, 14% from oil/natural gas-fired stations and 7% from hydroelectric stations.




Substantially all of PPL Energy Supply's total expected generation in 2011 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales.  PPL Energy Supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2012 and beyond.  These commitments are consistent with, and integral to, PPL Energy Supply's business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices.  See "Commodity Volumetric Activity" in Note 19 to the Financial Statements for the strategies PPL Energy Supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio.




PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont and New Hampshire with a generating capacity (winter rating) of 33 MW.  PPL EnergyPlus sells the energy and RECs produced by these plants to commercial, industrial and institutional customers.  During 2010, the projects owned and operated by these PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries generated 154 million kWhs.




PPL EnergyPlus purchases the capacity, energy and RECs from two wind farms in Pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 MW.  These contracts extend through 2027.




See "Item 2. Properties - Supply Segment" for additional information regarding PPL Generation's plans for capital projects in Pennsylvania and Montana that are expected to provide 247 MW of additional electric generating capacity by 2013.







  

Fuel Supply







PPL EnergyPlus acts as agent for PPL Generation to procure and optimize its various fuels.




Coal




Pennsylvania




PPL EnergyPlus actively manages PPL's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern Appalachia.




During 2010, PPL Generation purchased 100% of the coal delivered to PPL Generation's wholly owned Pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts.  These contracts provided PPL Generation 7.0 million tons of coal.  Contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.9 million tons of coal in 2011.  The amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations.




PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, has an agreement that provides more than one-third of PPL Generation's projected annual coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2011 through 2018.  PPL Generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for their projected annual needs from 2011 through 2013.




A PPL Generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the Keystone station and in Keystone Fuels, LLC and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station and in Conemaugh Fuels, LLC.  The Keystone station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for its coal requirements, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the Keystone station in 2010.  The Conemaugh station requirements are purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC, which provided 4.0 million tons of coal to the Conemaugh station in 2010.




All PPL Generation Pennsylvania coal stations have scrubbers installed.  Limestone is necessary to operate the scrubbers.  Acting as agent for PPL Brunner Island, LLC and PPL Montour, LLC, PPL EnergyPlus has entered into long-term contracts with limestone suppliers that will provide for those plants' limestone requirements through 2012.  During 2010, 457,000 tons of limestone were delivered to Brunner Island and Montour under long-term contracts.  Annual limestone requirements approximate 600,000 tons.




Montana




PPL Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3.  NorthWestern owns a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 4.  PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4.  However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs.  PPL Montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications.  PPL Montana, along with the other owners, has a long-term purchase 
and supply agreement with the current supplier for Units 1 and 2 which, provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through December 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from January 2015 through December 2019.  The coal supply contract for Unit 3's requirements is in effect through December 2019.




These units were built with scrubbers and PPL Montana has entered into a long-term contract that commences in January 2011 through December 31, 2030, to purchase the lime requirements for these units.




Coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette station.  The contracts covered 100% of the station's coal requirements in 2010, and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2012.




Oil and Natural Gas




Pennsylvania




PPL Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased on the spot market while oil requirements were supplied from inventory.  At December 31, 2010, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units.




Short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel facility.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for Lower Mt. Bethel were purchased on the spot market.




In 2008, PPL EnergyPlus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the Ironwood facility.  PPL EnergyPlus has long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of Ironwood's maximum daily requirements, which began in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Ironwood will be served through a combination of transportation capacity release transactions and delivered supply to the plant.  PPL EnergyPlus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for Ironwood.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for Ironwood were purchased on the spot market.




Illinois




At December 31, 2010, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the University Park facility.




Connecticut




PPL EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas.




Nuclear




The nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.




PPL Susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services.  These contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2017.  PPL Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units.




Federal law requires the U.S. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational.  As a result, it was necessary to expand Susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity.  To support this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology.  The facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed.  The facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999.  PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approxi
mately 2017 under current operating conditions.  If necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant.




In 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998.  In 1997, the Court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially adequate remedy if the DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998.  The DOE did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel by that date.  The DOE continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages.  In January 2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. &#
160;Discovery in the case has concluded but the Court has not yet set a date for trial.  PPL cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.







  

Energy Marketing







PPL EnergyPlus sells the capacity and electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, FTRs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and RECs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets.




PPL EnergyPlus purchases and sells capacity and electricity at the wholesale level at competitive prices under FERC market-based prices.  Within the constraints of its hedging policy, PPL EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations.




PPL EnergyPlus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and provides retail natural gas supply to customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.

 
 




  

Competition







Since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in U.S. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives.  While some states, such as Pennsylvania and Montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industry.  Some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration.  In addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers.  The activity around re-regulation, however, has slowed due to the current 
environment of declining power prices.  As such, the competitive markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive.




The Supply segment faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services.  Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  The Supply segment primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  Competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiari
es of regulated utilities and other energy marketers.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Supply Segment" and PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets.







  

Franchise and Licenses







See "Background - Segment Information - Supply Segment - Energy Marketing" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses in various states.  PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the DOE to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.




PPL Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating licenses that expire in 2042 for Unit 1 and in 2044 for Unit 2.




In 2008, PPL Susquehanna received NRC approval for its request to increase the generation capacity of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The project is being completed in phases over several years.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the total expected capacity increase is estimated to be 195 MW.  The final phase of the Unit 1 uprate was completed in 2010 and yielded 55 MW for PPL Susquehanna.  The final phase of the Unit 2 uprate is scheduled for 2011 and is projected to yield an additional 50 MW for PPL Susquehanna.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the expected remaining expenditures is $15 million.




In 2008, a PPL subsidiary submitted a COLA to the NRC for a new nuclear generating unit (Bell Bend) to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna plant. Also in 2008, the COLA was accepted for review by the NRC.  In February 2010, the NRC published its official review schedule that culminates with the issuance of Bell Bend's final safety evaluation report in 2012.  See Note 8 to Financial Statements for additional information.




PPL Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license that was recently extended by the FERC to expire in 2030.  PPL Holtwood operates the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044.  PPL Holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation (Safe Harbor), which holds a project license that extends operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030.  The total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating station was 423 MW at December 31, 2010, and PPL Holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity.  In September 2010, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries signed definitive agreements to sell their ownership interests in Safe Harbor 
and two other non-core generating facilities.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




In October 2009, the FERC approved the request to expand the Holtwood plant and extended the operating license through August 2030.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




The 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in Montana are licensed by the FERC.  The FERC license for the Mystic facility was relicensed, effective January 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year term.  The Thompson Falls and Kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine Missouri-Madison facilities expire in 2040.




In connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the FERC to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or allow the U.S. government to take over the facility.  If the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the Kerr Dam license.

SEASONALITY




The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather.  As a result, PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity.




FINANCIAL CONDITION




See PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this information.




CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS




See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for the years 2011-2015.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters.




ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS




PPL and its subsidiaries are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters.  The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations over the next few years that will directly affect the electric industry.  These initiatives cover all sources - air, water and waste.  See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2010 and projected environmental capital expenditures fo
r the years 2011-2015.  Also, see "Environmental Matters" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  To comply with air related requirements, PPL's forecast for capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years.  Such projections are a combined $2.1 billion for LG&E and KU and $400 million for PPL Energy Supply.  Actual costs may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements.  Environmental compliance costs incurred by LG&E and KU are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions.  In complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, GHG emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities.  PPL's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS




PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with their businesses.  While we have identified below the risks we currently consider material, these are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 15 to the Financial
 Statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results.




As used in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International Regulated segment discussions, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Regulated segment discussion.




Risks Related to All Segments




(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)




We will selectively pursue growth of generation and transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.




We will pursue expansion of our generation and transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure.  We will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion.  These types of projects involve numerous risks.  Any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs.  With respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of ex
isting plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.  The success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals.  If we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project.  Furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings.




Adverse conditions in the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




Adverse conditions in the financial markets during 2008 and the associated contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets contributed significantly to declines in wholesale energy prices, significantly impacting our earnings during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009.  The breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. and international business environment, including our businesses.  As a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities has declined significantly.  This reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as PJM) and our Pennsylvania and Kentucky utility businesses, especially industrial customer demand.  The combination of lower demand for power and natu
ral gas and other fuels has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results.  In general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition.




Our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business.  Global bank credit capacity declined and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, thereby introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit.  Although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. 
 Additionally, regulations to be adopted to implement the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act of 2010 may impose requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent.




Our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions.




Our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles.  For example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or severe storms occur.  The patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity.




Operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters.




Weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure or requiring significant repair costs. Storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues or increase expenses, due to reduced usage and higher restoration charges.  In addition, weather and other disturbances may affect capital markets and general economic conditions and impact future growth.




Our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change.




Climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation changes, and thus may impact consumer demand for electric power. Temperature increases could result in increased overall electricity volumes or peaks and precipitation changes could result in altered availability of water for plant cooling operations. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. Conversely, climate change could have a number of potential impacts tending to reduce demand. Changes may entail more frequent or more intense storm activity, which, if severe, could temporarily disrupt regional economic conditions and adversely affect electricity demand levels.  Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electric powe
r, particularly power generated by fossil-fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on the regional economy. Reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas --both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously low-cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. Also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electric usage generally.




We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities.  An adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues" and in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case.




We could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond credit ratings or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets.




In the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing means to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt interest or maturities and operating needs. As a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rate levels; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. Changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased liquidity to our domestic regulated utility businesses.




A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt.




Credit ratings assigned by Moody's, Fitch and S&P to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses.  Although we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ratings Triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating.




Significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity.




We continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses.  However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations.  Increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors.  In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees.  We provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees.  These benefits give rise to significant expenses.  Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, 
the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits.  In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees.  The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control.  These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants.  If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contri
bution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly.




We may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings.




Under GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.  Although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2010, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary.




We also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  See Notes 8, 9 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information on impairment charges taken during the reporting periods.  We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years.




We may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations.




In connection with various divestitures, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities and with respect to certain transactions. These indemnities and guarantees relate to, among other things, liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture.




We are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution businesses.




The conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial effects, caused to or caused by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties.




Our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance.




Operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. These events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently or lead to increased costs, expenses or losses.  Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue or increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers.  Planned and unplanned outages at our power plants can require us to purchase pow
er at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them.




Although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur.




We are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations.




Changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations.  We are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities.  These tax obligations include income, property, sales and use and employment-related taxes.  We also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. Due to the revenue needs of the states and jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered.  We cannot predict whether legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses.  If enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a negative impact on ou
r results of operations and cash flows.




(PPL and PPL Electric)




Risks Related to Domestic Regulated Utility Operations




Our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to the Kentucky Regulated segment and the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.  Set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments.




Our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments.  Regulators may not approve the rates we request.




We currently provide services to our utility customers at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including those commissions referred to below.  While such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our regulated generation, transmission and distribution customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities.  There can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments.  While our rates are generally reg
ulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. With respect to PPL's November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, each of LG&E and KU has agreed with the KPSC, subject to certain limited exceptions such as fuel and environmental cost recoveries, that no base rate increases would take effect for their Kentucky retail customers before January 1, 2013.  Our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators.  If our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.




Our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation.




Various federal and state entities, including but not limited to the FERC, the KPSC, the VSCC, the TRA and PUC regulate many aspects of the domestic utility operations of PPL, including:








·


the rates that we may charge and the terms and conditions of our service and operations;








·


financial and capital structure matters;








·


siting, construction and operation of facilities;








·


mandatory reliability and safety standards and other standards of conduct;








·


accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies;








·


tax matters;








·


affiliate restrictions;








·


acquisition and disposal of utility assets and securities; and








·


various other matters.







Such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties. In any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek.




We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards.




Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties which may not be recoverable from customers.




Changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues.




Wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. Changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not estimable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. These can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which PPL participates.




Our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs.




The domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of LKE) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. The completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including:








·


approval, licensing and permitting;








·


land acquisition and the availability of suitable land;








·


skilled labor or equipment shortages;








·


construction problems or delays, including disputes with third party intervenors;








·


increases in commodity prices or labor rates;








·


contractor performance;








·


environmental considerations and regulations;








·


weather and geological issues; and








·


political, labor and regulatory developments.







Failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators.




Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment




(PPL)




The costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes.




Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to LG&E's and KU's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business related activities; and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material. In addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules are expanded or changed.  Costs may take the form of increased capital or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industr
ial power users, and may impact the costs of their products or demand for our services.





Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment




(PPL and PPL Electric)




We may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of PJM's regional transmission expansion plan (RTEP) process.




PJM and the FERC have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners.  As discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line that PJM has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid.  Although the FERC has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable.  In addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, whether due to delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control.  As a resul
t, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other RTEP projects on PPL Electric.




We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to Pennsylvania Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs.




Act 129 became effective in October 2008.  This law created requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposed new PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provided remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard.  The law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013).  Utilities not meeting these requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates.  Although we expect to meet these requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us.  See "Regul
atory Issues - Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Reliability Standards" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




Cost recovery remains subject to political risks.




Although prior initiatives have not resulted in the enactment of such legislation, the possibility remains that certain Pennsylvania legislators could introduce legislation to reinstate generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for Pennsylvania utilities after the end of applicable transition periods, which in PPL Electric's case was December 31, 2009.  If such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls.  In addition, continuing uncertainty regarding PPL Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its b
usiness.




(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




Risks Related to International Regulated Segment




Our U.K. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance.




Our U.K. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework.  In addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance.  Disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that Ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels.




In December 2009, Ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015, thus reducing regulatory rate risk in the International Regulated segment until the next rate review which will be effective April 1, 2015.  The regulated income of the International Regulated segment and also the RAB are to some extent linked to movements in the Retail Price Index (RPI).  Reductions in the RPI would adversely impact revenues and the debt/RAB ratio.




Our U.K. distribution business exposes us to risks related to U.K. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the U.K. government.  These risks may reduce the results of operations from our U.K. distribution business.




The acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the U.K. entail significant financial risks including:








·


changes in laws or regulations relating to U.K. operations, including tax laws and regulations;








·


changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements;








·


changes in general economic conditions affecting the U.K.;








·


regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies;








·


severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets;








·


changes in labor relations;








·


limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors;








·


limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans;








·


fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in converting U.K. revenues to U.S. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and








·


compliance with U.S. foreign corrupt practices laws.







Risks Related to Supply Segment




(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




We face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.




Unlike our regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure.  Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  These competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business.




We sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration.  Competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability.  We believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity.




We also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services.  We primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  We also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have.




Competitors in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities.  In the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector.  Entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of PUHCA in 2006.  The repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have.




Adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.




Our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, RECs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs.  Unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production.  As a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.  Among the factors that influence such prices are:








·


supply and demand for electricity available from current or new generation resources;








·

We do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility.




We attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts.  We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities.  However, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.




We are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets.




We purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the FERC throughout the U.S. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations.  If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages.  These damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity.  Depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental com
pliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity.




Our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  We currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts.  Our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. See Note 7 for a discussion of PPL's credit facilities.




We also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract.  Whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  However, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages.




The load following contracts that PPL EnergyPlus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins.




We generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation.  If the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss.  Alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market.  Therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared to our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation
s or financial position.




We may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities.




We purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations.




Our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs.




We actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions.  We have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics.  Nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned.  For example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations.  Additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrea
se market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions.  We enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery.  Similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address.  As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position.




In addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk.  We have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk.  However, if counterparties fail to perform, the risk of which has increased due to the economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.  In that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected.




Our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.




Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection.  To comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance.




In order to comply with existing and proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 PPL began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction).  The cost to install this equipment was approximately $1.6 billion.  The scrubbers at our Montour and Brunner Island plants are now in service.  Many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict.  As a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently 
in effect, which could require us to significantly increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment.




We may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs.  Furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units.




For more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.




We rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity.  If transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered.




We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities.  If transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by ISOs and RTOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products at the most favorable terms.




The FERC has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis.  Although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require.  We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs and RTOs in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services.




Despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities.




Our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market.  Generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC.  The FERC has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.  The FERC retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates.  Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  See "FERC Market-Based Rate Authority" in
 Note 15 to the Financial Statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's market-based rate authority program, and "PJM RPM Litigation" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for information regarding the FERC's proceedings that could impact PJM's capacity pricing model.




In addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs.




If market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.




In some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities.  The ISOs that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address extremely high prices in the power markets.  These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms.  Although we generally expect electricity markets to 
continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. See "New Jersey Capacity Legislation" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.




Changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants.




A basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices.  There are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns.  Research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies.  It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production.  Also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by custome
rs could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators.  These alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants.  As a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced.




We are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life.




Nuclear generation accounted for about 29% of our 2010 generation output.  The risks of nuclear generation generally include:








·


the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;








·


limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and








·


uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.  The licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the ARO related to the decommissioning.







The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  In addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.  There also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to PPL that cannot be predicted.  In addition, although we have no reason t
o anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our Susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance.
