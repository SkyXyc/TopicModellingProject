General

 

Public Storage was organized in 1980.  Effective June 1, 2007, we reorganized Public Storage, Inc. into Public Storage (referred to herein as “the Company”, “the Trust”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”).  Our principal business activities include the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use, and we also have equity interests in commercial facilities.

 

At December 31, 2011, our operating segments are comprised of the following:

 





(i)  


Domestic Self-Storage: This segment comprises our direct and indirect equity interests in 2,058 self-storage facilities (131 million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the United States (“U.S.”) operating under the “Public Storage” brand name.  We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S.




 





(ii)  


European Self-Storage:  This segment comprises our 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, a private company that we believe is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  Shurgard Europe owns 188 self-storage facilities (10 million net rentable square feet of space) located in seven countries in Western Europe which operate under the “Shurgard” brand name manages one facility located in the United Kingdom that is wholly-owned by Public Storage.




 





(iii)  


Commercial:  This segment is primarily composed of our 42% equity interest in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”), (see Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for more information regarding our ownership interest).  PSB’s business activities primarily include the ownership and operation of 27 million net rentable square feet of commercial space.  We also wholly-own one million net rentable square feet of commercial space that is managed by PSB.




 

We conduct certain other activities that are not allocated to any segment, due to their relatively insignificant scale and dissimilarity in operating characteristics to our existing segments, including:  (i) the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities, (ii) the sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities and (iii) management of self-storage facilities owned by third-party owners and entities that we have an ownership interest in but are not consolidated.

 

For all taxable years subsequent to 1980, we qualified and intend to continue to qualify as a REIT, as defined in Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal or significant state tax on that portion of our taxable income which is distributed to our shareholders, provided that we meet certain tests.  To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders.

 

We report annually to the SEC on Form 10-K, which includes financial statements certified by our independent registered public accountants.  We have also reported quarterly to the SEC on Form 10-Q, which includes unaudited financial statements with such filings.  We expect to continue such reporting.

 

On our website, www.publicstorage.com, we make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Competition

 

Self-storage facilities generally draw customers located within a three to five mile radius.  Many of our facilities operate within three to five miles of well-located and well-managed competitors who utilize many of the same marketing channels we use, including yellow page and Internet advertising, as well as signage and banners.  As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.

 

While competition is significant, the self-storage industry remains fragmented in the U.S.  We believe that we own approximately 5% of the aggregate self-storage square footage in the U.S., and that collectively the five largest self-storage operators in the U.S. own approximately 10% of the aggregate self-storage space in the U.S., with the remaining 90% owned by numerous private regional and local operators.  This market fragmentation enhances the advantage of our economies of scale and our brand relative to other operators, and provides an opportunity for growth through acquisitions over the long term.

 

In seeking investments, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.  The amount of capital available for real estate investments greatly influences the competition for ownership interests in facilities and, by extension, the yields that we can achieve on newly acquired investments.

 

Business Attributes

 

We believe that we possess several primary business attributes that permit us to compete effectively:

 

Centralized information networks: Our facilities are part of a comprehensive centralized reporting and information network which enables our management team to identify changing market conditions and operating trends as well as analyze customer data, and quickly change our properties’ pricing and promotional discounting on an automated basis.

 

National Telephone Reservation System:  Customers calling either the toll-free telephone referral system, (800) 44-STORE, or a particular storage facility, are directed to our centralized telephone reservation system.  The sales representatives in the call center are sales specialists.  These sales representatives discuss space requirements, location preferences, and price constraints with the prospective customer, and seek to meet those requirements with all our available space in the area, as well as other products and services we provide, in more consistent and comprehensive manner than an on-site property manager.  We believe the centralized telephone reservation system provides added customer service and helps to maximize utilization of available self-storage space relative to using the self-storage property managers to process our incoming sales inquiries.

 

On-line reservation and marketing system: We also provide customers the ability to review space availability, pricing, and make reservations online through our website, www.publicstorage.com.  We invest extensively in advertising on the Internet, primarily through the use of search engines, and we regularly update and improve our web site to enhance its productivity.

 

Economies of scale: We are the largest provider of self-storage space in the U.S.  As of December 31, 2011, we operated 2,058 self-storage facilities in which we had an interest with over one million self-storage spaces rented.   These facilities are generally located in major markets within 38 states in the U.S.  The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues through the centralization of many functions with specialists, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, revenue management, as well as the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures.  We also believe that our major market concentration provides managerial efficiencies stemming from having a large number of facilities in close proximity to each other.

Our market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers makes various promotional and media programs more cost-beneficial for us than for our competitors.  We can economically purchase large, prominent, well-placed yellow page ads that allow us to reach the consumer more effectively than smaller operators.  Our large market share and well-recognized brand name increases the likelihood that our facilities will appear prominently in unpaid search results in Google and other search engines, and enhances the efficiency of our bidding for paid multiple-keyword advertising.  We can use television advertising in many markets, while most of our competitors cannot do so cost-effectively.

 

Brand name recognition: We believe that the “Public Storage” brand name is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry in the U.S, due to our national reach in major markets in 38 states, and our highly visible facilities, with their orange colored doors and signage, that are located principally in heavily populated areas.  We believe that the “Shurgard” brand, used by Shurgard Europe, is a similarly established and valuable brand in Europe.

 

Complementary ancillary operations: We also sell retail items associated with self-storage such as locks, cardboard boxes, and packing supplies, and we reinsure policies issued to our tenants against lost or damaged goods stored by our tenants.  We believe these activities supplement our existing self-storage business by further meeting the needs of our customers.

 

Growth and Investment Strategies

 

Our growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self-storage facilities, (ii) acquiring more facilities, (iii) developing or redeveloping existing real estate facilities, (iv) participating in the growth of commercial facilities, primarily through our investment in PSB, and (v) participating in the growth of Shurgard Europe.  While our long-term strategy includes each of these elements, in the short run the level of growth in our asset base in any period is dependent upon the cost and availability of capital, as well as the relative attractiveness of investment alternatives.

 

Improve the operating performance of existing facilities: We seek to increase the net cash flow generated by our existing self-storage facilities by a) regularly evaluating our call volume, reservation activity, and move-in/move-out rates for each of our facilities relative to our marketing activities, b) evaluating market supply and demand factors and, based upon these analyses, adjusting our marketing activities and rental rates, c) attempting to maximize revenues through evaluating the appropriate balance between occupancy, rental rates, and promotional discounting and d) controlling operating costs.  We believe that our property management personnel and systems, combined with our national telephone reservation system and media advertising programs, will continue to enhance our ability to meet these goals.

 

Acquire properties owned or operated by others in the U.S.: We seek to capitalize on the fragmentation of the self-storage business through acquiring attractively priced, well-located existing self-storage facilities.  We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities.  Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities.  Since January 1, 2007, we have acquired 64 facilities from third parties (4.4 million net rentable square feet) for approximately $434.7 million, including 11 facilities (0.9 million net rentable square feet) for approximately $80.4 million in 2011.  The level of third-party acquisition opportunities available to us depends upon many factors, including the motivation of potential sellers to liquidate their investments and the ability of leveraged owners to economically refinance existing mortgage debt.  We decide whether to pursue any such acquisition opportunities based upon many factors including our opinion as to the potential for future growth, the quality of construction and location, and our yield expectations.

 

Development of real estate facilities: We believe that in the long-run, development of new storage locations and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities represent an important part of our growth strategy. New locations can be developed to meet customer needs and expand our market penetration.  In addition, existing facilities can be expanded or enhanced to provide additional amenities such as climate control, or to better capitalize on increased population density in certain facilities’ local market area.    We have developed a significant number of new self-storage locations, and expanded existing self-storage facilities, in our history.  However, due to the challenging operating environment, we substantially curtailed our development activities beginning in 2008.  We continue to have a nominal development pipeline at December 31, 2011.  Shurgard Europe has similarly reduced its development activities (see “Capitalize on the Potential for Growth in Europe” below).

Participate in the growth of commercial facilities primarily through our ownership in PS Business Parks, Inc.:  Our investment in PSB provides us some diversification into another asset type, and we have no plans of disposing of our investment in PSB.  During 2010 and 2011, the challenging economic trends in commercial real estate resulted in year over year decreases in rental income for PSB’s “same park” facilities.  It is uncertain what impact these trends will have on PSB’s future occupancy levels and rental income.

 

Over the past two years, PSB has been able to grow its portfolio through acquisitions.  In 2010, PSB acquired a total of 2.3 million net rentable square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $301.7 million, and in 2011, PSB acquired a total of 5.6 million net rentable square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $553.5 million.  PSB is a stand-alone public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  As of December 31, 2011, it owned and operated approximately 27.2 million net rentable square feet of commercial space, and had an enterprise value of approximately $3.0 billion (based upon the trading price of PSB’s common shares combined with the liquidiation value of its debt and preferred stock, as of December 31, 2011).

 

Participate in the growth of European self-storage through ownership in Shurgard Europe:  Our investment in Shurgard Europe provides us with some diversification from U.S. self-storage.  Shurgard Europe is the largest self-storage company in Western Europe and owns and operates approximately 10 million net rentable square feet in seven countries:  France (principally Paris), Sweden (principally Stockholm), the United Kingdom (principally London), the Netherlands, Denmark (principally Copenhagen), Belgium and Germany.

 

In contrast to the U.S., the European self-storage industry is relatively immature.  In each of the markets that Shurgard Europe operates in, customer awareness of the product, and availability of product, is low relative to the U.S.  Although many European consumers are not yet aware of the self-storage concept, they tend to live in more densely populated areas in smaller living spaces (as compared to the U.S.) that, we believe, should make self-storage an attractive product.  Most Europeans are familiar with the concept of storage only as an ancillary service provided by moving companies, and more consumer familiarity, combined with more available self-storage space, could result in a significant increase in the utilization of the self-storage product in the long term.  In the longer term, we believe that there is significant potential for Shurgard Europe to expand the number of self-storage facilities it owns in Europe, either through development of new facilities or acquisition of existing facilities from private or publicly-held owners.

 

We own 49% of Shurgard Europe and one wholly-owned property in London.  The other 51% is owned by a large U.S. pension fund.  We have no plans of disposing of our investment in Shurgard Europe.  During 2011, we and our joint venture partner made a pro-rata equity contribution to fund Shurgard Europe’s acquisition of the 80% equity interests it did not own in two legacy joint ventures owning 72 self-storage facilities for an aggregate of $237.9 million (€172.0 million).  As a result, Shurgard Europe now wholly-owns 188 facilities.

 

In November 2011, Shurgard Europe obtained a €215.0 million term loan from Wells Fargo which matures in November 2014 (the “Wells Fargo Loan”).  The proceeds from the Wells Fargo Loan were used to repay debt (€183.0 million) secured by the 72 facilities held by the joint ventures, as well as repay €32.0 million of the debt Shurgard Europe owes to Public Storage which totaled $402.7 million (€311.0 million) at December 31, 2011.

 

The Wells Fargo Loan requires Shurgard Europe to utilize a significant amount of its operating cash flow to reduce the outstanding principal.  As a result, and in the absence of additional capital contributions by either us or our joint venture partner, Shurgard Europe’s ability to finance growth will be very limited until the Wells Fargo Loan has been repaid.

Financing of the Company’s Growth Strategies

 

Overview of financing strategy:  Over the past three years we funded the cash portion of our acquisition and development activities with permanent capital (predominantly retained cash flow and the net proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities).  We have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt, because of certain benefits described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.’’  Our present intention is to continue to finance substantially all our growth with internally generated cash flows and permanent capital.

 

Issuance of preferred and common securities:   We believe that we are not dependent upon raising capital to fund our existing operations or meet our obligations, due to our low levels of debt and significant cash from operations available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources” below).  However, access to capital is important to growing our asset base.  When growth capital is needed, we select either common or preferred securities based upon the relative cost of capital.  For at least the last ten years, we have raised cash proceeds for growth and other corporate purposes primarily through the issuance of preferred securities, while we have issued common stock only in connection with mergers and the acquisition of interests in real estate entities.  During periods of favorable market conditions, we have generally been able to raise capital at attractive costs; however, we are dependent upon capital market conditions and there can be no assurance that future market conditions will be favorable.  During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we issued approximately $862.5 million and $270.0 million, respectively, of preferred securities, and on January 12, 2012, we issued another $460.0 million of preferred securities.

 

Borrowing: We have in the past used our $300 million revolving line of credit as temporary “bridge” financing, and repaid those amounts with permanent capital.  When we have assumed debt in the past, we have generally prepaid such amounts except in cases where the nature of the loan terms did not allow such prepayment, or where a prepayment penalty made it economically disadvantageous to prepay.  Our current debt outstanding was assumed either in connection with property acquisitions or in connection with the merger with Shurgard in 2006.  While it is not our present intention to issue additional debt as a long-term financing strategy, we have broad powers to borrow in furtherance of our objectives without a vote of our shareholders.  These powers are subject to a limitation on unsecured borrowings in our Bylaws described in “Limitations on Debt” below.

 

Our senior debt has an “A” credit rating by Standard and Poor’s.  Notwithstanding our desire is to continue to meet our capital needs with preferred and common equity, this high rating, combined with our low level of debt, could allow us to issue a significant amount of unsecured debt in the current markets if we were to choose to do so.

 

Issuance of securities in exchange for property: We have issued both our common and preferred securities in exchange for real estate and other investments in the past.  Future issuances will be dependent upon our financing needs and capital market conditions at the time, including the market prices of our equity securities.

 

Joint Venture financing: We have formed and may form additional joint ventures to facilitate the funding of future developments or acquisitions.  However, we can generally issue preferred securities on more favorable terms than joint venture financing.

 

Disposition of properties: Disposition of properties to raise capital has not been one of our strategies. Generally, we have disposed of self-storage facilities only because of condemnation proceedings, which compel us to sell.  We do not presently intend to sell any significant number of self-storage facilities in the future, though there can be no assurance that we will not.

Investments in Real Estate and Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

 

Investment Policies and Practices with respect to our investments: Following are our investment practices and policies which, though we do not anticipate any significant alteration, can be changed by our Board of Trustees without a shareholder vote:

 





·  


Our investments primarily consist of direct ownership of self-storage facilities (the nature of our self-storage facilities is described in Item 2, “Properties”), as well as partial interests in entities that own self-storage facilities.




 





·  


Our partial ownership interests primarily reflect general and limited partnership interests in entities that own self-storage facilities that are managed by us under the “Public Storage” brand name in the U.S., as well as storage facilities managed in Europe under the “Shurgard” brand name which are owned by Shurgard Europe.




 





·  


Additional acquired interests in real estate (other than the acquisition of properties from third parties) will include common equity interests in entities in which we already have an interest.




 





·  


To a lesser extent, we have interests in existing commercial properties (described in Item 2, “Properties”), containing commercial and industrial rental space, primarily through our investment in PSB.




 

Facilities Owned by Subsidiaries

 

In addition to our direct ownership of 2,015 self-storage facilities in the U.S. and one self-storage facility in London, England at December 31, 2011, we have controlling indirect interests in entities that own 26 self-storage facilities in the U.S. with approximately two million net rentable square feet.  Due to our controlling interest in each of these entities, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these entities in our financial statements.

 

Facilities Owned by Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

 

At December 31, 2011, we had ownership interests in entities that we do not control or consolidate, comprised of PSB, Shurgard Europe, and various limited partnerships that own an aggregate of 17 self-storage facilities with approximately one million net rentable square feet of storage space.  These entities are referred to collectively as the “Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.”

 

PSB, which files financial statements with the SEC, and Shurgard Europe, have debt and other obligations that we do not consolidate in our financial statements.  All of the other Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities have no significant amounts of debt or other obligations.  See Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for further disclosure regarding the assets, liabilities and operating results of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.

 

Limitations on Debt

 

Without the consent of holders of the various series of Senior Preferred Shares, we may not take any action that would result in our “Debt Ratio” exceeding 50%.  “Debt Ratio”, as defined in the related governing documents, represents generally the ratio of debt to total assets before accumulated depreciation and amortization on our balance sheet, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As of December 31, 2011, the Debt Ratio was approximately 3%.

 

Our bank and senior unsecured debt agreements contain various customary financial covenants, including limitations on the level of indebtedness and the prohibition of the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of defined events of default.  We believe we have met each of these covenants as of December 31, 2011.

Employees

 

We have approximately 5,000 employees in the U.S. at December 31, 2011 who render services on behalf of the Company, primarily personnel engaged in property operations.

 

Seasonality

 

We experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of self-storage facilities with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months.  We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months.

 

Insurance

 

We have historically carried customary property, earthquake, general liability and workers compensation coverage through internationally recognized insurance carriers, subject to customary levels of deductibles.  The aggregate limits on these policies of $75 million for property losses and $102 million for general liability losses are higher than estimates of maximum probable loss that could occur from individual catastrophic events determined in recent engineering and actuarial studies; however, in case of multiple catastrophic events, these limits could be exhausted.

 

Our tenant insurance program reinsures a program that provides insurance to certificate holders against claims for property losses due to specific named perils (earthquakes are not covered by these policies) to goods stored by tenants at our self-storage facilities for individual limits up to a maximum of $5,000.  We have third-party insurance coverage for claims paid exceeding $1.0 million resulting from any one individual event, to a limit of $25.0 million.  Effective December 1, 2011, these coverage amounts were changed to $5.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2011, there were approximately 0.7 million certificate holders held by our self-storage tenants participating in this program, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $1.5 billion.  We rely on a third-party insurance company to provide the insurance and are subject to licensing requirements and regulations in several states.

ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors

 

In addition to the other information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the risks described below that we believe may be material to investors in evaluating the Company.  This section contains forward-looking statements, and in considering these statements, you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward-looking statements that are described in Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of Item 1.

 

Since our business consists primarily of acquiring and operating real estate, we are subject to the risks related to the ownership and operation of real estate that can adversely impact our business and financial condition.

 

The value of our investments may be reduced by general risks of real estate ownership.    Since we derive substantially all of our income from real estate operations, we are subject to the general risks of acquiring and owning real estate-related assets, including:  

 





•  


lack of demand for rental spaces or units in a locale;  




 





•  


changes in general economic or local conditions;  




 





•  


natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods; which could exceed the aggregate limits of our insurance coverage; 




 





•  


potential terrorist attacks;  




 





•  


changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing facilities in an area;  




 





•  


the impact of environmental protection laws;  




 





•  


changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage funds which may render the sale of a nonstrategic property difficult or unattractive including the impact of the current turmoil in the credit markets;  




 





•  


increases in insurance premiums, property tax assessments and other operating and maintenance expenses;




 





•  


transactional costs and liabilities, including transfer taxes;




 





•  


adverse changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations; and  




 





•  


tenant and employment-related claims.  




 

In addition, we self-insure certain of our property loss, liability, and workers compensation risks for which other real estate companies may use third-party insurers.  This results in a higher risk of losses that are not covered by third-party insurance contracts, as described in Note 13 under “Insurance and Loss Exposure” to our December 31, 2011 financial statements.

 

There is significant competition among self-storage facilities and from other storage alternatives.    Most of our properties are self-storage facilities, which generated most of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Local market conditions play a significant part in how competition will affect us. Competition in the market areas in which many of our properties are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses.  Any increase in availability of funds for investment in real estate may accelerate competition.  Further development of self-storage facilities may intensify competition among operators of self-storage facilities in the market areas in which we operate.

We may incur significant environmental costs and liabilities.    As an owner and operator of real properties, we may be required by law to clean up hazardous substances at our properties.  Certain laws impose liability whether or not the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous substances.  Liability is usually not limited to the value of the property.  The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination, also may adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, operate, or encumber affected facilities.

 

We have evaluated the environmental condition of, and potential liabilities associated with, most of our properties by conducting preliminary environmental assessments.  These assessments generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at the property (not including soil or groundwater sampling or analysis), as well as a review of publicly available information regarding the site and other properties in the vicinity.  As a result, we have become aware that prior activities at some facilities (or migration from nearby properties) have or may have resulted in contamination to the soil or groundwater at these facilities.  When purchasing new properties, if we become aware of potential or actual contamination, we may attempt to obtain purchase price adjustments, indemnifications or environmental insurance coverage.  We cannot assure you that such protections, if obtained, will always be sufficient to cover actual future liabilities nor that our assessments have identified all such risks.  Although we cannot provide any assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of our facilities material to our overall business, financial condition or results of operations.

 

There has been an increasing number of claims and litigation against owners and managers of rental properties relating to moisture infiltration, which can result in mold or other property damage.  When we receive a complaint or otherwise become aware that an air quality concern exists, we implement corrective measures and seek to work proactively with our tenants to resolve issues, subject to our contractual limitations on liability for such claims.  However, we can give no assurance that material legal claims relating to moisture infiltration and the presence of, or exposure to, mold will not arise in the future.

 

Delays in development and fill-up of our properties would reduce our profitability.    Development of self-storage facilities is subject to significant risks.  Construction and opening of these facilities can be delayed or increase in cost due to changes in or failure to meet government or regulatory requirements, weather issues, unforeseen site conditions, personnel problems, and other factors.  Once newly developed facilities are opened, rent-up of the newly developed space can be delayed or ongoing cash flow yields can be reduced due to competition, reductions in storage demand, or other factors.  While we or Shurgard Europe are not currently planning to develop additional facilities in the short-run, if we or Shurgard Europe were to commence significant development of facilities, our exposure to development and fill-up risks would increase.

 

Property taxes can increase and cause a decline in yields on investments.    Each of our properties is subject to real property taxes, which could increase in the future as property tax rates change and as our properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.  Recent local government shortfalls in tax revenue may cause pressure to increase tax rates or assessment levels or impose new taxes.  Such increases could adversely impact our profitability.

 

We must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire and safety regulations, which can require significant expenditures.    All our properties must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with related regulations (the “ADA”) and similar state law requirements.  A failure to comply with the ADA or similar state laws could lead to government imposed fines on us and/or litigation, which could also involve an award of damages to individuals affected by the non-compliance.  In addition, we must operate our properties in compliance with numerous local fire and safety regulations, building codes, and other land use regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can require us to spend substantial amounts of money, which would reduce cash otherwise available for distribution to shareholders.  Failure to comply with these requirements could also affect the marketability of our real estate facilities.

 

We incur liability from tenant and employment-related claims.    From time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration (including class actions) to resolve tenant or employment-related claims and disputes.

 




  



12







  



 

 

Global economic conditions adversely affect our business, financial condition, growth and access to capital.

 

There continues to be global economic uncertainty, elevated levels of unemployment, reduced levels of economic activity, and it is uncertain as to when economic conditions will improve.  These negative economic conditions in the markets where we operate facilities, and other events or factors that adversely affect demand for storage space, could continue to adversely affect our business.

 

Our ability to issue preferred shares or other sources of capital, such has borrowing, has been in the past, and may in the future, be adversely affected by challenging credit market conditions.  The issuance of perpetual preferred securities historically has been a significant source of capital to grow our business.  We believe that we have sufficient working capital and capacity under our credit facilities and our retained cash flow from operations to continue to operate our business as usual and meet our current obligations.  However, if we were unable to issue preferred shares or borrow at reasonable rates, that could limit the earnings growth that might otherwise result from the acquisition and development of real estate facilities.

 

The acquisition of existing properties is a significant component of our long-term growth strategy, and  acquisitions of existing properties are subject to risks that may adversely affect our growth and financial results.

 

We acquire existing properties, either in individual transactions or as part of the acquisition of other storage operators.  In addition to the general risks related to real estate described above, we are also subject to the following risks which may jeopardize our realization of benefits from acquisitions.

 

Any failure to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions and to successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing business could negatively impact our financial results.   To fully realize anticipated earnings from an acquisition, we must successfully integrate the property into our operating platform. Failures or unexpected circumstances in the integration process, such as a failure to maintain existing relationships with tenants and employees due to changes in processes, standards, or compensation arrangements, or circumstances we did not detect during due diligence, could jeopardize realization of the anticipated earnings.

 

Acquired properties are subject to property tax reappraisals which may increase our property tax expense. Facilities that we acquire are subject to property tax reappraisal which can result in substantial increases to the ongoing property taxes paid by the seller.   The reappraisal process is subject to judgment of governmental agencies regarding estimated real estate values and other factors, and as a result there is a significant degree of uncertainty in estimating the property tax expense of an acquired property.  In connection with future or recent acquisitions of properties, if our estimates of property taxes following reappraisal are too low, we may not realize anticipated earnings from an acquisition.

As a result of our ownership of 49% of the international operations of Shurgard Europe with a book value of $375.5 million at December 31, 2011, and our loan to Shurgard Europe aggregating $402.7 million at December 31, 2011, we are exposed to additional risks related to international businesses that may adversely impact our business and financial results.

 

We have limited experience in European operations, which may adversely impact our ability to operate profitably in Europe.  In addition, European operations have inherent risks, including without limitation the following:

 





·  


currency risks, including currency fluctuations, which can impact the fair value of our equity investment in Shurgard Europe, as well as interest payments and the net proceeds to be received upon repayment of our loan to Shurgard Europe;




 





·  


unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements,




 





·  


potentially adverse tax burdens;




 





·  


burdens of complying with different permitting standards, environmental and labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws;




 





·  


the potential impact of collective bargaining;




 





·  


obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;




 





·  


regional, national and local political uncertainty;




 





·  


economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets;




 





·  


difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;




 





·  


reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries;




 





·  


inability to effectively control less than wholly-owned partnerships and joint ventures; and




 





·  


the importance of local senior management and the potential negative ramifications of the departure of key executives.




 

The following additional specific risks apply with respect to our interest in and loan to Shurgard Europe:

 





·  


Shurgard Europe has debt outstanding that will be repaid before our loan:   Shurgard Europe has a loan outstanding to Wells Fargo totaling $274.4 million (€211.9 million) at December 31, 2011.  While our loan participates pari passu with the Wells Fargo loan in a liquidation of Shurgard Europe, the Wells Fargo loan is due on November 2014, while our loan to Shurgard Europe matures in February 2015.  In addition, Shurgard Europe is obligated to utilize most of its available cash flow to make principal payments on the Wells Fargo loan, which limits the principal payments that could otherwise be made on our loan.  As a result, the Wells Fargo Loan will be repaid prior to our loan.

·  


Shurgard Europe’s ability to repay its loan from us and Wells Fargo may be limited due to market conditions.  If Shurgard Europe’s available cash flow significantly declines and it is unable to obtain financing at a reasonable cost of capital due to a constrained equity or credit environment, negative operating trends, or other factors, it may not be able to repay either the Wells Fargo loan, or our loan.  In such a circumstance, we may have to pursue less advantageous options, such as an additional equity contribution or loan, extending the maturity date of our loan, or exercising our lender rights.  We have in the past extended the maturity date of our loan to Shurgard Europe, most recently to February 2015 from March 2013.




 





·  


Shurgard Europe’s Same Store revenues have decreased in the past, and have recently exhibited negative trends.   While Shurgard Europe had positive Same Store revenue growth in 2010 and 2011, the growth in Same Store revenue decreased to 1.3% in 2011 from 3.0% in 2010, and it had negative revenue growth in 2009 and could have reductions in revenue in the future.  Such reductions may negatively impact Shurgard Europe’s liquidity and ability to repay its debts (including the debt owed to us), due to declining interest coverage ratios and other metrics which affect the availability and cost of capital, as well as reduce the value of our investment in Shurgard Europe.




 

We are subject to risks related to our ownership of assets in joint venture structures, most notably our investment in Shurgard Europe:

 

Ownership of assets in joint ventures may present additional risks, including without limitation, the following:

 





·  


risks related to the financial strength, common business goals and strategies and cooperation of the venture partner;




 





·  


the inability to take some actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we may believe are favorable, if our joint venture partner does not agree;




 





·  


the risk that we could lose our REIT status based upon actions of the joint ventures if we are unable to effectively control these indirect investments;




 





·  


the risk that we may not control the legal entity that has title to the real estate;




 





·  


the risk that our investments in these entities may not be easily sold or readily accepted as collateral by our lenders, or that lenders may view assets held in joint ventures as less favorable as collateral;




 





·  


the risk that the joint ventures could take actions which may negatively impact our preferred shares and debt ratings, to the extent that we could not prevent these actions;




 





·  


the risk that we may be constrained from certain activities of our own that we would otherwise deem favorable, due to non-compete clauses in our joint venture arrangements; and




 





·  


the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with our joint venture partners.




 

The Hughes Family could control us and take actions adverse to other shareholders. 

 

At December 31, 2011, B. Wayne Hughes, former Chairman and current member of the Board of Trustees and his family (the “Hughes Family”) owned approximately 16.7% of our aggregate outstanding common shares.  Our declaration of trust permits the Hughes Family to own up to 47.66% of our outstanding common shares.  Consequently, the Hughes Family may significantly influence matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including electing trustees, amending our organizational documents, dissolving and approving other extraordinary transactions, such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may not be favorable to other shareholders.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and in our declaration of trust and bylaws may prevent changes in control or otherwise discourage takeover attempts beneficial to shareholders.

 

Certain provisions of Maryland law may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our shares.  Currently, the Board has opted not to subject the Company to the statutory limitations of either the business combination provisions or the control share acquisitions provisions of Maryland law, but the Board may change this option as to either statute in the future.  If the Board chooses to make them applicable to us, these provisions could delay, deter or prevent a transaction or change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of common shares or might otherwise be in their best interest.  Similarly, (1) limitations on removal of trustees in our declaration of trust, (2) restrictions on the acquisition of our shares of beneficial interest, (3) the power to issue additional common shares, preferred shares or equity shares, (4)  the advance notice provisions of our bylaws and (5) the Board’s ability under Maryland law, without obtaining shareholder approval, to implement takeover defenses that we may not yet have and to take, or refrain from taking, other actions without those decisions being subject to any heightened standard of conduct or standard of review, could have the same effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of the common shares or might otherwise be in common shareholders’ best interest.

 

To preserve our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), our declaration of trust contains limitations on the number and value of shares of beneficial interest that any person may own.  These ownership limitations generally limit the ability of a person, other than the Hughes Family (as defined in our declaration of trust) and other than “designated investment entities” (as defined in our declaration of trust), to own more than 3% of our outstanding common shares or 9.9% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of preferred or equity shares, in each case, in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, unless an exemption is granted by our board of trustees.  These limitations could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company not approved by our board of trustees.

 

If we failed to qualify as a REIT for income tax purposes, we would be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.

 

Investors are subject to the risk that we may not qualify as a REIT for income tax purposes. REITs are subject to a range of complex organizational and operational requirements.  As a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders.  Other restrictions apply to our income and assets.  Our REIT status is also dependent upon the ongoing qualification of our affiliate, PSB, as a REIT, as a result of our substantial ownership interest in that company.

 

For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and are unable to avail ourselves of relief provisions set forth in the Code, we would be subject to federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income, whether or not we make any distributions to our shareholders.  Those taxes would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders or for reinvestment and would adversely affect our earnings.  As a result, our failure to qualify as a REIT during any taxable year could have a material adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.  Furthermore, unless certain relief provisions apply, we would not be eligible to elect REIT status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we fail to qualify.

 

We may pay some taxes, reducing cash available for shareholders.

 

Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay some federal, foreign, state and local taxes on our income and property.  Since January 1, 2001, certain corporate subsidiaries of the Company have elected to be treated as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” of the Company for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is taxable as a regular corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in excess of a certain amount.  In addition, to the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries are in excess of amounts that would be paid under similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments.  To the extent that the Company is required to pay federal, foreign, state or local taxes or federal penalty taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to shareholders.

We have become increasingly dependent upon automated processes, telecommunications, and the Internet and are faced with system security and system failure risks.

 

We have become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes, and certain critical components of our operating systems are dependent upon third party providers.  As a result, we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence, such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, or a circumstance that disrupted operations at our third party providers.  Even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and back-up procedures, a significant outage in our third party providers could negatively impact our operations.  In addition, an increasing  portion of our business operations are conducted over the Internet, increasing the risk of viruses and other related risks that could cause system failures and disruptions of operations.  Experienced computer programmers may be able to undertake a “cyber-attack” and penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns, which could result in additional costs or legal liability to us.  Nearly half of our new tenants come from sales channels dependent upon telecommunications (telephone or Internet).

 

We have no ownership interest in Canadian self-storage facilities owned or operated by the Hughes Family.

 

At December 31, 2011, the Hughes Family had ownership interests in, and operated, 53 self-storage facilities in Canada under the name “Public Storage”, which name we license to the Hughes Family for use in Canada on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis.  We currently do not own any interests in these facilities nor do we own any facilities in Canada.  We have a right of first refusal to acquire the stock or assets of the corporation engaged in the operation of the self-storage facilities in Canada if the Hughes Family or the corporation agrees to sell them.  However, we have no ownership interest in the operations of this corporation, have no right to acquire their stock or assets unless the Hughes family decides to sell, and receive no benefit from the profits and increases in value of the Canadian self-storage facilities.  Although we have no current plans to enter the Canadian self-storage market, if we choose to do so without acquiring the Hughes Family interests in their Canadian self-storage properties, our right to use the Public Storage name in Canada may be shared with the Hughes Family unless we are able to terminate the license agreement.

 

Through our subsidiaries, we continue to reinsure risks relating to loss of goods stored by tenants in the self-storage facilities in Canada in which the Hughes Family has ownership interests.  We acquired the tenant insurance business on December 31, 2001 through our acquisition of PS Insurance Company, or PSICH.  During each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, we received $0.6 million, respectively, in reinsurance premiums attributable to the Canadian facilities.  Since PSICH’s right to provide tenant reinsurance to the Canadian Facilities may be qualified, there is no assurance that these premiums will continue.

 

We are subject to laws and governmental regulations and actions that affect our operating results and financial condition.

 

Our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies including those imposed by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and New York Stock Exchange, as well as applicable labor laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties, increased costs of compliance and restatement of our financial statements.

 

There can also be no assurance that, in response to current economic conditions or the current political environment or otherwise, laws and regulations will not be implemented or changed in ways that adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, such as recently adopted legislation that expands health care coverage costs or facilitates union activity or federal legislative proposals to otherwise increase operating costs.

Our tenant insurance business is subject to governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.

 

We hold Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses from a number of individual state Departments of Insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision.  Our continued ability to maintain these Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with related rules and regulations.  The regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret, and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance agents.  As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our reinsurance activities, including those activities we have conducted in the past, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment in a given jurisdiction.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenues from our tenant reinsurance business represented approximately 4% of our revenues.

 

Terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.

 

There is the risk of terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war against the U.S., the European Community, or their businesses or interests, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.  Attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our operating results.  Further, we may not have insurance coverage for losses caused by a terrorist attack.  Such insurance may not be available, or if it is available and we decide to obtain such terrorist coverage, the cost for the insurance may be significant in relationship to the risk overall.  In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Finally, further terrorist acts could cause the U.S. to enter into a wider armed conflict, which could further impact our business and operating results.

 

Developments in California may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

 

We are headquartered in, and approximately one-fifth of our properties in the U.S. are located in, California, which like many other state and local jurisdictions is facing severe budgetary problems and deficits.  Action that may be taken in response to these problems, such as increases in property taxes, changes to sales taxes, adoption of a proposed “Business Net Receipts Tax” or other governmental efforts to raise revenues could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
