Commitments and Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005  

        The collaborator development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to Novartis in the amount of approximately $20.0 million that was advanced
under a loan facility established pursuant to the original collaboration agreement with Novartis. Loans under the facility were intended to fund early
clinical trials of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development. In February 2004, we amended the terms of the Novartis collaboration agreement. Under the amended
agreement, Novartis assumed responsibility for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development. Consequently the loan facility providing funding for
development activities by Vertex was terminated. Outstanding loans that funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to compounds not selected by Novartis
will be repayable without interest in May 2008. Please refer to Note O, "Significant Revenue Arrangements", to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding these loans. 


        At
December 31, 2005, we had $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2007 Notes and $118.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes outstanding. We
are required to make 

49




 


semi-annual
interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of both the 2007 and 2011 Notes. Our aggregate annual interest payment obligation is approximately $8.9 million. 


Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Obligations at December 31, 2005  

        At December 31, 2005, our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases, a purchase obligation and
contractual commitments related to our research and development programs. These items are not required under GAAP to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. They are disclosed in the table
presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at December 31, 2005. 

        The
term under our Kendall Square lease began January 1, 2003. We began making lease payments in May 2003. We have an obligation, staged over a number of years, to build
out the leased space into finished laboratory and office space (the "Kendall Square Facility"). The lease will expire in 2018, and we have options to extend for two consecutive terms of ten years
each. The Company's future minimum commitments under the Kendall Square lease for the period commencing January 1, 2006, including lease payments and a construction obligation, are
$30.0 million for 2006, $45.5 for 2007 and 2008, $47.6 million for 2009 and 2010 and $195.7 million for the period thereafter. These amounts are included in the table above. We
expect to occupy and use for our operations approximately 40% of the Kendall Square Facility. We have entered into two subleases for the remaining rentable square footage at the Kendall Square
Facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations. The subleases will expire in 2011 and 2012 and contain options to extend through 2015 and 2018, respectively. One of the subleases has
certain termination provisions beginning in 2010. The future minimum committed income from the subleases is $7.4 million for 2006, $16.3 million for 2007 and 2008, $16.3 million
for 2009 and 2010 and $6.2 million for years thereafter. These amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above. See Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense."
to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

        Commitments
under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business. 

        The
purchase obligation referred to above arises under our agreement to purchase a minimum of $3.0 million of products from Invitrogen Corporation annually for three years. We
made this commitment in connection with the sale of certain assets of our former Discovery Tools and Services business on March 28, 2003. 

        Our
table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance pay obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a
not-for-cause termination under existing employment contracts. The cash amount for which the Company might be liable upon any such termination, based on current executive pay
and bonus levels, could range from $0.4 to $1.4 million. 


Liquidity and Capital Resources  

        We have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity
and debt securities, strategic collaborative agreements that include research and development funding, development milestones and royalties on the sales of products, proceeds from the disposition of
assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business, investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs. 

        At
December 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $407.5 million, which is an increase of $15.2 million from $392.3 million at
December 31, 2004. The increase reflects net proceeds of approximately $165.4 million from our public offering of common stock, which closed in June 2005, as well as
$32.2 million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit 

50




 


plans,
offset by the net loss of $203.4 million. Expenditures for property and equipment during the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 were $17.0 million. 

        As
part of our strategy to manage our long-term operating cash needs, we exchanged approximately $155.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible
subordinated notes, plus interest, in a series of transactions, for approximately 10.6 million shares of newly issued common stock. As a result of these exchanges, we incurred a
non-cash charge of approximately $48.2 million. This charge is related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number that would have been issued upon
conversion of the notes under their original conversion prices. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the
2007 Notes and approximately $118.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. The 2011 Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price
equal to $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject
to adjustment under certain circumstances. 

        The
restructuring accrual of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 relates to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy, and includes
build-out commitments and other lease obligations, recorded at net present value. In 2005, we made cash payments of $24.2 million against the accrual and received
$3.2 million in sublease rental income. We expect to make net cash payments of approximately $14.4 million against the accrual in 2006. We review our estimates underlying the
restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis, and the accrual, and consequently any expected future payment, could change with any change in our estimates. 


        The
net decrease of $33.8 million in deferred revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 is a result of revenue recognized in 2005 related to cash payments
received from collaborators, primarily Novartis and Merck, in previous periods, which were deferred and are being recognized over our period of performance in accordance with our revenue recognition
policy. In connection with new collaborations in 2005, we received and recognized as revenue approximately $25.0 million up-front license payments. We also received $22.0 million in
milestone payments from our collaborators during 2005. Consistent with our revenue recognition policy, we recognized approximately $10.0 million of this amount and have deferred recognition of
the majority of these milestone payment amounts, which will be recognized over our remaining period of obligation. 


        In
February 2004, we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis. Under the amended agreement, Novartis assumed responsiblity for all nonclinical and clinical
development of drug candidates that it accepts for development. Consequently, the loan facility established under the original agreement, which provided funding for development activities by Vertex,
has been terminated. As permitted under the amended agreement, on June 22, 2004, we gave notice to Novartis of our election to develop VX-680 outside of our Novartis collaboration.
As a result, we repaid to Novartis approximately $12.5 million of unspent and uncommitted loan amounts relating to VX-680. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$20.0 million in remaining loans outstanding under the loan facility. Loans advanced by Novartis for the development of collaboration compounds under the original agreement will be forgiven on
a compound-by-compound basis if any such compounds are selected by Novartis for development. All loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable, without interest, in
May 2008. 

        We
expect to continue to make significant investments in our drug candidates, particularly in clinical trials of VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770, in our ion channel and kinase discovery
efforts, in our effort to prepare for potential registration, regulatory approval and commercial launch of our product candidates and in supply chain management. Consequently, we expect to incur
losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future. We also expect to incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing, prosecution, defense
and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights. 

51




 


        In
2006 and in future periods, the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements, including repayment of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes, will
depend on many factors, including the number, breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs, the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates
and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments. Collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy. We will continue to rely on cash
receipts from our existing research and development collaborations, including research funding, development reimbursements and potential milestone payments, and from new collaborations, in order to
help fund our research and development efforts. 

        As
part of our strategy for managing our capital structure, we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues, privately negotiated
transactions and market purchases, depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time. During 2006 we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to
undertake one or more additional capital transactions. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. 


        To
the extent that our current cash and marketable securities, in addition to the above-mentioned sources, are not sufficient to fund our activities, it will be necessary to raise
additional funds through public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing. We also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing
opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on
acceptable terms, if at all. 


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. These items are constantly monitored and
analyzed by management for changes in
facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do
not turn out to be substantially accurate. 

        We
believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expense, revenue recognition, research and development expenses and investments, all of which are
important to our financial condition and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. Our accounting polices, including the ones discussed below, are
more fully described in Note B, "Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 



 Restructuring and Other Expense  



        We record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred, in accordance with
SFAS 146. As prescribed by SFAS 146, we use a probability-weighted discounted cash-flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability. The probability-weighted discounted cash-flow
analysis is based on management's assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations, including contractual rental commitments, build-out commitments and building operating costs, and
estimates of income from subleases, based on the term and timing of such subleases. We discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 10%. These cash flow estimates are
reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. Adjustments are based, 

52




 

among
other things, on management's assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates. Because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the
time-value of money, the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time, even if all other factors remain unchanged. 


        Our
estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past, and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future, resulting in additional
adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability. The effect of any such adjustments could be material. For example, we currently have two subleases for portions of the Kendall Square Facility
with terms of six and seven years, respectively, and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases. As a result, we
may be exposed to market variability in the future. We will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the Kendall Square lease is
terminated, and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. 


        The
accrual for restructuring expense of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 is related to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy. This
estimate represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the ongoing obligation. 



 Revenue Recognition  



        We recognize revenue in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101") as amended
by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104") and for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21"). 

        Our
revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of the agreements typically include payment to Vertex of
non-refundable up-front license fees, funding of research and development efforts, milestone payments and/or royalties on product sales. 

        Agreements
containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the
customer and whether we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective
fair values or the residual method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. 

        We
recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is typically the research or
development term. Research and development funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of effort. 

        Substantive
milestones are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured and we have evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations. Substantive
milestones are recognized over the period of performance when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured but we do not have fair value for our remaining obligations. This typically results in a
portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue at the date the milestone is achieved, which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of
the date the milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. We evaluate whether milestones are substantive at the inception of the
agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome as well as the level of effort and
investment required to achieve the milestone. Milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. 

        Payments
received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned. 

53






<A
NAME="page_de1067_1_54">   
        Royalty revenue on our products Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories, as provided by our
collaborator GlaxoSmithKline, and is recognized in the period the sales occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant,
are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known. 



 Research and Development Costs  



        All research and development costs, including amounts funded by research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. Research and development
expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits; laboratory supplies; contract services, including clinical trial costs; and
infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and depreciation. To record clinical trial, contract services and other outside costs, we are required to make estimates of the costs incurred in a
given accounting period and record accruals at period-end, because the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period-end. We base our
estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service
contract, where applicable. 



 Altus Investment  



        We assess our investment in Altus Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we account for using the cost method, on a quarterly basis to determine if there has been any
estimated decrease in the fair value of that investment below its $18.9 million carrying value that might require us to write down the cost basis of the asset. If any adjustment to the fair
value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost, we consider the evidence available to us, including the duration and extent to which the decline is
other-than-temporary. If the decline is considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of
the write-down is included in the consolidated statements of operations. We have not identified facts or circumstances which would cause us to determine that the investment basis of our
interest in Altus should be changed. 

        Altus
completed an initial public offering in January 2006. We own 817,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of common stock. In addition, we hold
450,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock, which are not convertible into common stock and which are redeemable at our option on or after December 31, 2010, or by Altus at any time. We are
restricted from trading Altus securities for a period of six months following the initial public offering. Due to the public offering, in 2006 we will classify the common stock as an
available-for-sale investment and record it at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses are realized. We will continue to account for the warrants under the cost method of accounting until the end of the
restricted trading period, at which time the warrants will be classified as derivatives. Gains or losses on the fair market value of the warrants, as derivatives, will be included in the consolidated
statements of operations. We will continue to account for the redeemable preferred stock under the cost method of accounting. 

Results of Operations  

        The following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations. We sold the assets of our Discovery Tools and
Services business in two independent transactions in March and December 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS
No. 144"), the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified in the Company's consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations was accomplished using estimates and assumptions we have 

54




 


deemed
appropriate based upon the information currently available. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the
Discovery Tools and Services business operated on a stand-alone basis during the periods presented. 

        As
a result of the disposition of these assets, we now operate in a single operating segment: Pharmaceuticals. 

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004  

        Our net loss for 2005 was $203,417,000, or $2.28 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2004 of $166,247,000, or $2.12 per basic and
diluted common share. Our loss in 2005 includes restructuring expense of $8,134,000 and a charge of $48,213,000 for the exchange of newly issued common stock for a portion of our outstanding
convertible notes. Our loss in 2004 includes restructuring expense of $17,574,000 and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of $3,446,000. 

        Our
net loss for 2005, as compared with our net loss for 2004, increased primarily as a result of increased development investment to advance our propriety drug candidates, which was
partially offset by an increase in revenue. 

        Total
revenues increased to $160,890,000 in 2005 compared to $102,717,000 in 2004. In 2005, revenue was comprised of $32,829,000 in royalties and $128,061,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenues, as compared with $17,322,000 in royalties and $85,395,000 in collaborative research and development revenue in 2004. 

        Royalties
consist of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty revenue. Fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name Lexiva in the United States
and Telzir in the European Union. Royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. We began earning royalties on sales of Lexiva in the United
States in the fourth quarter of 2003 and on Telzir in the European Union in third quarter of 2004. The increase in royalty revenue is due to the increase in Lexiva/Telzir sales. By the end of
2005, Lexiva had largely replaced Agenerase in worldwide markets. As a result, we expect that royalty revenue in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of Lexiva/Telzir royalty revenue. We pay
a royalty to a third party on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir. 

        Collaborative
and other research and development revenues increased $42,666,000, or 50%, in 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase in collaborative and other research and development
revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements in 2004 and in 2005. In 2005 we entered into collaboration agreements with Avalon Pharmaceuticals (license, development
and commercialization of VX-944) and GlaxoSmithKline (research, license, development and commercialization of VX-409). Under these new collaboration agreements, in 2005 we
earned $5,000,000 in up-front license fees from Avalon and $20,000,000 in up-front license fees from GlaxoSmithKline. In 2004 we entered into collaboration agreements with CFFT (cystic fibrosis drug
discovery), Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation (Far East development and commercialization of VX-950), and Merck (research, development and commercialization of Aurora kinase inhibitors,
including VX-680 and VX-667). We recognized revenue of approximately $7,339,000 in 2005 from two milestone payments made by Merck in our Aurora kinase inhibitor collaboration, one
made in connection with Merck's selection of VX-667 as a follow-on compound to VX-680, and one for demonstrating that administration of VX-680 to patients had an effect on a clinically relevant
biomarker, in an aggregate amount of $19.5 million. We earned $2.5 million in milestone revenue from Kissei related to the completion of regulatory filings in preparation for
Phase I clinical development of VX-702 in Japan.

        We
expect that collaborative and other research and development revenues will continue to be a significant component of our total revenues and we are seeking to enter into additional
collaboration agreements in 2006 that could be material to our business. 

        Research
and development expenses increased $56,378,000, or 29%, to $248,540,000 in 2005, from $192,162,000 in 2004. The increase in research and development expenses in 2005 as compared
with 2004 is primarily a result of investment in our clinical development programs for VX-950 and VX-702. Development expenses accounted for 87%, or $48,875,000, of the aggregate increase in research
and development expenses. In 2005 we incurred costs from Phase II-enabling activities for VX-950, we completed enrollment in a 315-patient Phase II clinical trial of VX-702 for
the treatment of RA, and we continued a Phase IIb clinical trial (called the "METRO" trial) of merimepodib (VX-497) for the treatment of HCV infection. We initiated the METRO trial
during 2004. During 2004 we also completed a Phase Ia trial of VX-950, and began a Phase Ib evaluation of VX-950 in patients with chronic HCV infection. During the fourth
quarter of 2004 we commenced Phase II clinical development of VX-765 in psoriasis. 

        Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, laboratory supplies, contractual services and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and
depreciation. Set forth below

        To date we have incurred in excess of $1 billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development. We expect research and
development expenses in 2006 to be greater than in 2005 due to increased investment in clinical development as we advance our core programs. In 2006, we expect to focus our preclinical and
clinical development investment on VX-950, VX-702 and VX-770. However, our anticipated 2006 research and development expenses could vary materially from our projections, depending on the occurrence
and timing of clinical trials and actual clinical trial
results. We expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug candidates. We
do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new research collaborations. 

        We
estimate that it takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the U.S. as outlined below: 




Phase: 
 
Objective:
 
Estimated
Duration:


Discovery
 
Lead identification and target validation

Preclinical
 
Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data

Phase I
 
Evaluate safety in humans; study how the drug works, metabolizes and interacts with other drugs
 
1 to 2 years


Phase II
 
Establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage; continue safety evaluation
 
2 to 4 years


Phase III
 
Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug; submit New Drug Application
 
2 to 4 years

        Animal
and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical trials. 

        The
successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors. The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type,
complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products,
typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from preclinical,
nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are
susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The duration and cost of discovery, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly
over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available. The most
significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Given the uncertainties related to development, we are
currently unable to reliably estimate when, if ever, our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows. 

        Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $1,851,000, or 4%, to $43,990,000 in 2005 from $42,139,000 in 2004. 

        For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded net restructuring expense of $8.1 million. This net expense includes a $10.0 million credit to the
restructuring accrual made when we decided in mid-2005 to occupy and use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility for our operations, which was offset by (i) the estimated incremental net
ongoing lease obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that we do not intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability.

        In
accordance with SFAS 146, we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the Kendall Square lease on at least a quarterly basis, and will make whatever modifications
we believe necessary until the termination of the lease, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. Our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future,
resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. Because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount
rate to reflect the time-value of money, the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time. 


        Interest
income increased approximately $1,671,000 to $11,994,000 in 2005 from $10,323,000 in 2004. The increase is mainly the result of higher returns on invested funds. 

58




 


        Interest
expense decreased $991,000 or 5% to $17,326,000 in 2005 from $18,317,000 in 2004 as a result of the exchange of newly issued stock for a portion of our outstanding
convertible debt in the second half of 2005. 

        In
addition, as a result of the issuance during 2005 of common stock in exhange for convertible subordinated notes, we recorded a non-cash charge of $48,213,000. This charge relates to
the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms. 

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2003  

        Our net loss for 2004 was $166,247,000, or $2.12 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss for 2003 of $196,767,000, or $2.56 per basic and
diluted common share. Our loss in 2004 includes restructuring and other expense of $17,574,000 and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of $3,446,000. Our loss in 2003 includes
restructuring and other expense of $91,824,000 and income from discontinued operations of $69,646,000. Included in the income from discontinued operations is a gain from the sale of assets of
$70,339,000. 

        Our
net loss for 2004, as compared with our net loss for 2003, decreased primarily as a result of increased revenue, principally related to new collaboration agreements and increased
royalties. 

        Total
revenues increased to $102,717,000 in 2004 compared to $69,141,000 in 2003. In 2004, revenue was comprised of $17,322,000 in royalties and $85,395,000 in collaborative and other
research and development revenues, as compared with $9,002,000 in royalties and $60,139,000 in collaborative research and development revenues in 2003. 

        Royalties
consist of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and Agenerase (amprenavir) royalty revenue. Fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name Lexiva in the United States
and Telzir in the European Union. Royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase. We began earning royalties on sales of Lexiva in the United
States in the fourth quarter of 2003 and on Telzir in the European Union in the third quarter of 2004. 


        Collaborative
and other research and development revenues increased $25,256,000, or 42%, in 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase in collaborative and other research and development
revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements and recognition of revenue in the amount of approximately $4.1 million from a $10 million milestone payment made in
connection with Novartis' selection of VX-322 for development. We also earned $2,500,000 in milestone revenue from GlaxoSmithKline relating to regulatory approval of Telzir in the European
Union and the initiation of Phase II clinical trials for brecanavir (VX-385). The table presented below is a summary of revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended 2004 as
compared with the year ended 2003.

        Research
and development expenses decreased to $192,162,000 in 2004, from $199,636,000 in 2003. Research expenditures were $113,276,000 in 2004 compared with $113,435,000 in 2003.
Development expenditures were $78,886,000 in 2004 compared with $86,201,000 in 2003. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2004 as compared with 2003 is a result of our decision to
focus during 

59




 


2004
on development activities aimed at new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases. In 2003, we engaged in development activities with drug candidates targeting potential therapeutic
indications other than viral and inflammatory diseases, including VX-944 (oncology), which is now licensed to Avalon and VX-680 (oncology), which is now licensed to Merck.
During 2004, we initiated the METRO trial. We completed a Phase Ia trial of VX-950, also for the treatment of HCV infection, and began a Phase Ib evaluation of VX-950 in
patients with chronic HCV infection. During the fourth quarter of 2004 we also commenced Phase II clinical development of VX-765 in psoriasis. 

        Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, laboratory supplies, contractual services and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and
depreciation. Set forth below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

        Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $3,057,000, or 8%, to $42,139,000 in 2004 from $39,082,000 in 2003. The increase is partially attributable to increased professional
consulting expenses incurred to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as increased costs related to the further development of our patent portfolio and increased business development
costs associated with the pursuit of new collaborative relationships. 

        Restructuring
and other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $17.6 million. The expense recorded during 2004 reflects a revision of our key estimates
and assumptions, specifically relating to the projected sublease rental rates and timing of subleases, as well as the imputed interest cost related to the restructuring accrual.

        Interest
income decreased approximately $5,089,000 to $10,323,000 in 2004 from $15,412,000 in 2003. The decrease is the result of both a lower level of invested funds and lower portfolio
yields due to a reduced interest rate environment. 

        In
connection with the sale of the assets of our Discovery Tools and Services business in 2003 we recorded income from discontinued operations of $69,646,000. Included in this amount is
a gain on the sale of those assets of $70,339,000.

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Annual Report will be important in determining future results. While management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward-
looking statements, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially, including the cautionary information set forth under the heading
"Risk Factors" appearing in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results. Other
factors besides those listed there could also adversely affect us. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

        In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments" ("FASB 123(R)"). FASB
123(R) revises FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FASB 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
("APB 25") and amends FASB Statement No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." FASB 123(R) requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based
compensation over the employees' service periods. Compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of
certain conditions. The fair value of an award is not re-measured after its initial estimation on the grant date. 

        We
are required to comply with FASB 123(R) beginning January 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). We will apply the Modified Prospective Method of adoption in our application of
FASB 123(R). Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the Effective Date (a) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123(R) to all share-based
payments granted after the effective date; and (b) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123 to all awards granted to employees prior to the Effective Date of
FASB 123(R) that remain unvested on the Effective Date. 

        As
permitted by FASB 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using APB 25's intrinsic value method, and therefore generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of FASB 123(R)'s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no
impact on our overall financial position. In 2006 we
expect to record approximately $34 million in compensation expense in connection with the adoption of FASB 123(R). The impact of adoption of FASB 123(R) beyond fiscal 2006
cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on our stock price and the amount of share-based awards granted in future periods, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation
assumptions, including, but not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors. However, had we adopted FASB 123(R) in prior periods, the impact
would have approximated the effect of FASB 123 as described in "Stock-Based Compensation" found in Note B to our consolidated financial statements. 


        In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" ("SFAS 154"). SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
"Accounting Changes" and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractible to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 154 on January 1, 2006 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
November 2005, FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP FAS 115-1"), which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are 

64




 


considered
impaired, whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
FSP FAS 115-1 in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        

        As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital
until it is required to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market risk-sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We do not have derivative
financial instruments in our investment portfolio. 

Interest Rate Risk  

        We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, investment grade
corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk, and could
decline in value if interest rates fluctuate. Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio
liquidity, and Vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of its investment instruments. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not
believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        

        (1)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    The Company's chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, the Company's management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 


        (2)    Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    The management of Vertex is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for 

65




 


external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 



•pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
•provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detections of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. 


        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


        The
Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the
criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, we have concluded that,
as of December 31, 2005, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 

        Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated below. 

        (3)    Changes in Internal Controls.    In connection with our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we did not change such internal control in a manner that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

(4) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

        To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated


        We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 


        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

66




 


        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


        In
our opinion, management's assessment that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2005 of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm        

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 

        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 


        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at
December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements        

A. The Company  

        Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Vertex" or the "Company") is a biotechnology company in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small
molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases. The Company intends to continue investing in and building capabilities in research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products
while it advances its product candidates to market. Vertex earns royalty revenues from the sale of Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium), a Vertex-discovered product for the treatment of HIV
infection, and conducts certain educational activities for this product in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc. 

        The
Company's corporate strategy is to retain principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of its proprietary drug candidates in certain major markets,
concentrating a significant part of its overall development and commercialization resources on those drug candidates. Vertex intends to rely on collaborators to conduct development and
commercialization of certain of its other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which the Company is not currently focused. The Company is concentrating most of its drug development
resources at the present time on three compounds: VX-950 for the treatment of HCV infection; VX-702 for the treatment of RA; and VX-770 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 

        Collaborations
are a key component of Vertex's corporate strategy. Collaborations provide Vertex with financial support and other valuable resources for its research programs,
development resources for its clinical drug candidates, and marketing and sales support for its products and product candidates. Vertex currently has drug candidates in development under
collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, Novartis Pharma AG, Mitsubishi Pharma Corp., Kissei Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., and Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

        Vertex
is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, rapid technological change and competition, uncertain protection of
proprietary technology, clinical trial uncertainty, dependence on collaborative relationships, share price volatility, the need to obtain additional funding, uncertainties relating to pharmaceutical
pricing and reimbursement, limited experience in manufacturing, sales and marketing, potential product liability and the need to comply with government regulations. The Company expects to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future, as a result of expenditures for its research and development programs. 

B. Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

        The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 

        The
assets of the Company's Discovery Tools and Services business sold in March 2003 and December 2003 represent a component of Vertex's business that, beginning in 2002,
had separately identifiable cash flows. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the consolidated statements
of operations and of cash flows have been restated to show the results of operations and cash flows of the assets sold as discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.
Please refer to Note C, "Sale of Assets," for further information. 

        All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

F-7




 


        The
Company operates in one segment, Pharmaceuticals, and all revenues are from United States operations. 

Reclassification in the Preparation of Financial Statements  

        Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Company reclassified certain marketable
securities on the 2004 consolidated balance sheets as long-term assets to conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported net loss. 


Use of Estimates  

        The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include restructuring and other
expense, revenue recognition, research and development expenses and investments. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

        The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents consist principally of money market funds, municipal bonds, and debt securities. Changes in cash and cash equivalents may be effected by shifts in investment portfolio maturities as well
as by actual cash receipts and disbursements. 

Marketable Securities  

        Marketable securities consist of investments in high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal bond securities and U.S. government
agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the balance
sheet. Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than one year and
(ii) the Company has the ability to hold them (a) until the carrying value is recovered and (b) such holding period may be longer than one year. Marketable securities are stated
at fair value with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses
are realized. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary, based on available
evidence, the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of operations. There were no write-downs of marketable securities in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are included in interest income. 

F-8




 


Investments  

        Investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 include long-term investments recorded using the cost method of accounting. When the Company holds an ownership
interest of less than 20%, and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment entity's operating activities, the Company accounts for its investment using the cost
method. If any adjustment to the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost, the Company considers the evidence available to it, including the
duration and extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is
considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in
the Company's consolidated statements of operations. There were no write-downs of investment in 2005 or 2004. 

Concentration of Credit Risk  

        Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of money market funds and marketable securities.
The Company places these investments in highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy, limits the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial institution. These amounts at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or
other foreign exchange hedging arrangements. 

        To
date, the Company's revenue has been generated from a limited number of customers in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In 2005 the
Company had significant revenue transactions with Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck which accounted for 33%, 33% and 15% respectively, of the Company's total revenue. In 2004, revenue transactions
with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline accounted for 49% and 19%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. In 2003, revenue transactions with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline represented 64% and 17%,
respectively, of the Company's total revenue. 

        Receivables
from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis represented approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005. Receivables
from GlaxoSmithKline and Mitsubishi represented approximately 46% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004. Management believes that credit risks
associated with these collaborators are not significant. 


Property and Equipment  

        Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease
terms or the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally four to seven years for furniture and equipment and three to five years for computers and software. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining life of the lease. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or
extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operations. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 

F-9




 


Long-Lived Assets  

        The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). In accordance with SFAS No. 144, management assesses the potential impairments
of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. If the
carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset the Company writes down the asset to its estimated fair value. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

        In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure"
("SFAS 148"), for periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and also applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
interpretations in accounting for all stock awards granted to employees. Under APB 25, provided that other criteria are met, when the exercise price of options or the issue price of restricted shares
granted to employees equals the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant, no compensation cost is required. 

        At
December 31, 2005, the Company had one Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note N,
"Common and Preferred Stock." For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $4,421,000, $1,661,000 and $16,000, respectively, in net compensation expense related to
restricted shares issued to employees. The net expense of $4,421,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 included approximately $840,000 of expense related to the accelerated vesting
of restricted stock awards in accordance with executives' severance agreements. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $211,000 in compensation expense related
to stock and option grants in accordance with executives' severance agreements. No additional stock-based employee compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in the Company's reported net
loss, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For stock options granted to
non-employees, the Company recognizes compensation costs in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123, which requires that companies recognize compensation expense for grants of
stock, stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value. 

        The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if the fair value recognition of SFAS 123 had been applied to the Company's stock-based employee
compensation. Employee stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a staight-line basis, as our valuation of options subject to SFAS 123 assumes a single weighted-average expected-life for each
award.

Restructuring and Other Expense  

        The Company records costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities, as defined in Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"), at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, changes to
a liability are measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate applied in the initial period. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded costs and liabilities for exit and
disposal activities related to a restructuring plan in accordance with SFAS 146. The liability is evaluated and adjusted as appropriate on at least a quarterly basis for changes in
circumstances. Please refer to Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense," for further information. 

Revenue Recognition  

        The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," ("SAB 104") and for revenue arrangements entered into after
June 30, 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21"). 

        The
Company's revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of the agreements typically include payment to
Vertex of non-refundable up-front license fees, funding of research and development efforts, milestone payments and/or royalties on product sales. 

        Agreements
containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the
customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation(s). The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective
fair values or the residual method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. 

        The
Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is typically the
research or 

F-11




 


development
term. Research and development funding is recognized as earned, ratably over the period of effort. 

        Substantive
milestones are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured and the Company has evidence of fair value for its remaining obligations. Substantive
milestones are recognized over the period of performance when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured but the Company does not have fair value for its remaining obligations. This typically
results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue at the date the milestone is achieved, which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has
elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. The Company evaluates whether milestones are substantive at
the inception of the agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the technological risk that must be overcome as well as the level of effort and
investment required to achieve the milestone. Milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. 

        Payments
received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned. 


        Royalty
revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee and is recognized in the period the sales
occur. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues, which have not historically been significant, are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known. 

Research and Development Costs  

        All research and development costs, including amounts funded by research collaborators, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised
of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits; laboratory supplies; contract services, including clinical trial costs; and infrastructure costs,
including facilities costs and depreciation. The Company's collaborators have agreed to fund portions of the Company's research and development programs related to specific research targets and drug
candidates, including, in 2005, VX-950, VX-702, kinases and certain cystic fibrosis research targets; in 2004, VX-950, kinases, caspase inhibitors, and certain cystic fibrosis research
targets; and in 2003, VX-702, kinases, caspase inhibitors, and certain cystic fibrosis research targets. The following table details the aggregate amount of research and development expenses
for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in thousands) for programs that are funded, in total or in part, by collaborators ("Collaborator-sponsored") and for programs
that the Company funds entirely with its own resources ("Company-sponsored"):

Income Taxes  

        Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the income tax bases of 

F-12




 


assets
and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against any net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. 

Debt Issuance Costs  

        Debt issuance costs incurred to complete Vertex's convertible subordinated note offerings are deferred and included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets. The costs are amortized based on the effective interest method over the term of the related debt issuance. The amortization expense is included in interest expense on the consolidated
statements of operations. Unamortized costs related to exchanged debt is reversed from other assets to additional paid-in capital. 

Stock Offering Costs  

        Expenses incurred in connection with common stock issuances are recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Comprehensive Loss  

        Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
certain marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive loss disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in foreign currency translation adjustment, as
the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiary. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

        The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are re-measured
into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the year. Revenue and expense amounts are re-measured using the average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Included in other comprehensive loss is a net
unrealized loss related to foreign currency translation of $18,000 at December 31, 2005 and a net unrealized gain related to foreign currency translation of $613,000 at December 31,
2004. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share  

        Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is not
anti-dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the exercise of outstanding stock options (the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding stock
using the treasury stock method), the assumed conversion of convertible notes and the vesting of unvested restricted shares of common stock. Common equivalent shares have not been included in the net
loss per share calculations because their effect would have

been
anti-dilutive. Total potential gross common equivalent shares consisted of the following (in thousands, except per share amounts):

New Accounting Pronouncements  

        In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments" ("FASB 123(R)"). FASB
123(R) revises FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FASB 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
("APB 25") and amends FASB Statement No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." FASB 123(R) requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based
compensation over the employees' service periods. Compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of
certain conditions. The fair value of an award is not re-measured after its initial estimation on the grant date. 

        Vertex
is required to comply with FASB 123(R) beginning January 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). The Company will apply the Modified Prospective Method of adoption in its
application of FASB 123(R). Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the Effective Date (a) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123(R) to all
share-based payments granted after the Effective Date and (b) based on application of the requirements of FASB 123 to all awards granted to employees prior to the Effective Date of
FASB 123(R) that remain unvested on the Effective Date. 

        As
permitted by FASB 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB 25's intrinsic value method, and therefore generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of FASB 123(R)'s fair value method will have a significant impact on the result of operations, although it will have no
impact on the overall financial position. In 2006 the Company expects to record approximately $34 million in compensation expense in connection with the adoption of
FASB 123(R). The impact of adoption of FASB 123(R) beyond fiscal 2006 cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on our stock price and the amount of share-based payments
granted in future periods, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions, including, but not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise
behaviors. However, had the Company adopted FASB 123(R) in prior periods, the effect would have approximated the impact of FASB 123 as described in "Stock-Based Compensation", above, in
this Note B. 

        In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ("SFAS 154")." SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
"Accounting Changes" and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractible to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The 

F-14




 


Company
does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 on January 1, 2006 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

        In
November 2005, FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP FAS 115-1"), which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered
impaired, whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP FAS 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company is required
to adopt FSP FAS 115-1 in the first quarter of 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
results of operations or financial condition. 

C. Sale of Assets  

        In March and December 2003, in two independent transactions, the Company sold the assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business. The Discovery Tools
and Services business specialized in assay development, screening services, instrumentation development and sales and the manufacture and sale of proteins, reagents and probes. As a result of these
sales, the Company now operates in one operating segment, Pharmaceuticals. 

        On
March 28, 2003, Vertex completed the sale of certain assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, including certain proprietary reagents, probes and proteins and
certain biochemical and cellular assay capabilities, to Invitrogen Corporation ("PanVera Asset Sale"). Substantially all of the assets sold were owned by Vertex's wholly-owned subsidiary, PanVera LLC
("PanVera"). In connection with the sale, Mirus Corporation ("Mirus") exercised a right of first refusal with respect to shares of Mirus owned by PanVera. Additionally, on the same date, Mirus
acquired certain of PanVera's assets. The aggregate gross consideration received by PanVera for the assets conveyed to Invitrogen and Mirus was approximately $97 million in cash and assumption
of certain liabilities. 

        In
connection with the sale, Vertex obtained a license from Invitrogen to make and use the reagents and probes sold to Invitrogen, solely for its drug discovery activities, conducted
independently and with collaborators, but has agreed that it will not engage in the business of providing reagents, probes or assay development services to third parties for a term of five years.
Vertex also agreed to purchase a minimum of $3 million of specified products annually from Invitrogen for three years after the completion of the sale. The prices of the products within the
purchase commitment approximate fair value. The sale did not include the instrumentation assets of the Discovery Tools and Services business, which were historically managed both financially and
operationally together with the assets sold on March 28, 2003. 

F-15






<A
NAME="page_fp1067_1_16">  

        The Company recorded a gain on the PanVera Asset Sale of approximately $69 million. The gain was recorded net of transaction costs and certain accruals and
receivables established for transaction bonuses payable by Vertex to former employees meeting certain employment requirements, an obligation in connection with certain annual contractual license fees
under a customer agreement, estimated losses on the three-year purchase commitment for required payments in excess of the fair value of products expected to be purchased and an adjustment based upon
the net book value of the assets sold on the closing date. Vertex has not recorded any income tax liability associated with the gain on the sale; operating losses were used to offset the taxable
income generated from the sale. Accruals recorded in connection with the sale are included in other obligations, current, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

        On
December 3, 2003, Vertex sold the remaining instrumentation assets of its Discovery Tools and Services business to Aurora Discovery, Inc., a new company formed by
Telegraph Hill Partners, LP and certain former employees of Vertex, for approximately $4.3 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets sold were used to develop and
commercialize liquid and cell-dispensing instruments that are used in high-throughput drug discovery screening and large-scale, automated molecular biology. Vertex has retained
non-exclusive licenses to use the instrumentation technologies sold in its drug discovery research. The Company recorded a $1.0 million gain on the sale. The gain was recorded net
of transaction costs. The Company did not record any income tax liability associated with the sale in December 2003; operating losses were used to offset the taxable income generated from the
sale. 

        The
combination of the Discovery Tools and Services assets sold in March 2003 and in December 2003 represents a component of the Company's business that, beginning in 2002,
was managed separately both financially and operationally. 

        In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the results of operations and cash flows of the assets
sold have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements under the heading "discontinued operations" for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The reclassification of the
amounts to discontinued operations has been prepared using certain estimates and assumptions deemed appropriate based upon information available. Amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are
not necessarily indicative of what revenues, expenses or income would have been had the business operated on a stand-alone basis. 


        Income
from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 is comprised of the following revenue and expenses (in thousands):

D. Restructuring and Other Expense  

        On June 10, 2003, Vertex adopted a plan to restructure its operations to coincide with its increasing internal emphasis on advancing drug candidates
through clinical development to 

F-16




 


commercialization.
The restructuring was designed to re-balance the Company's relative investments in research and development to better support the Company's long-term
objective of becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction, write-offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy approximately
290,000 square feet of specialized laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under lease to Vertex (the "Kendall Square lease"). The Kendall Square lease commenced in January 2003
and has a 15-year term. Based on developments in the Company's clinical pipeline in the second quarter of 2005, the Company revised its assessment of its real estate requirements. The
Company now expects to occupy approximately 120,000 square feet of the facility subject to the Kendall Square lease (the "Kendall Square Facility") in the future. The Company currently has sublease
arrangements in place for the remaining rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility. 


        For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net restructuring expense of $8.1 million. This net expense includes a $10.0 million credit to
the restructuring accrual made when the Company decided to occupy and use a portion of the Kendall Square Facility, which was offset by (i) the estimated incremental net ongoing lease
obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square that the Company does not intend to occupy and (ii) imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability. The portion of
the $18.2 million additional charge in 2005 that was for incremental lease obligations was related to the revision of certain key estimates and assumptions about operating costs, including real
estate taxes associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company does not intend to occupy.

        During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded $17.6 million of additional restructuring expense, which
primarily resulted from the revision of estimates and assumptions about when subtenants would be identified and secured and imputing an interest charge for the related restructuring liability.

        In accordance with SFAS 146, the Company's initial estimate of its liability for its net ongoing costs associated with the Kendall Square
Lease obligation was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 at fair value. The restructuring expense incurred from the second quarter of 2003 through the end of the first quarter of 2005 relates to
the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations associated with the entire Kendall Square Facility, together with imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability. The
restructuring expense incurred in the period beginning in the second quarter of 2005 will continue to be estimated in accordance with SFAS 146, but will relate only to the portion of the
building that the Company still does not intend to occupy. The lease obligations associated with the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company expects to occupy and use for its
operations are recorded as rental expense in the period incurred. The Company reviews its assumptions and estimates quarterly and updates its estimates of this liability as changes in circumstances
require. As prescribed by SFAS 146, the expense and liability recorded is calculated using probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of the Company's estimated ongoing lease
obligations, including contractual rental and build-out commitments, net of estimated sublease rentals, offset by related sublease costs. 

        In
estimating the expense and liability under its Kendall Square lease obligation, the Company estimated the costs that would be incurred to satisfy its rental and build-out
commitments under the lease (including operating costs), the time necessary to sublease the space, the projected sublease rental rates and the anticipated durations of subleases. The Company validates
its estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise. The Company used a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of approximately 10% to
discount the estimated cash flows. The Company will review its estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, until the termination of the Kendall Square lease, and will make whatever
modifications management believes necessary, based on the Company's best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. The Company's estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future,
resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability, and the effect of any such adjustments could be material. Because the Company's estimate of the liability includes the application of
a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time. Changes to the Company's estimate of
the liability are recorded as additional restructuring expense/(credit). 

        The
severance, benefits and other related costs also were recorded in accordance with SFAS 146 in the second quarter of 2003. The Company specifically identified all employees
whose employment was to be terminated and notified them prior to the end of the quarter in which the related charge was recorded. This restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 111 employees, or
13% of the Company's 

F-18




 


workforce,
of which 66 were from the Cambridge site and 45 were from the San Diego site. Of the terminated employees, 59% were from research, 30% were from sales, general and administrative, who
primarily supported research, and 11% were from development. 

        The
restructuring accrual of $43.0 million at December 31, 2005 relates solely to the portion of the Kendall Square Facility that the Company does not intend to use for its
operations and includes build-out commitments and other lease obligations, recorded at net present value. 


        Of
the $43.0 million restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005, the Company classified $14.4 million as short-term and $28.6 million as long-term. The
short-term portion of the accrual represents the amount the Company expects to pay out in 2006.

        The
Company has marketable securities of $283,112,000 and $331,240,000 classifed as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and $46,353,000 and $6,074,000, respectively, classified as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

        The
Company reviews investments in municipal bond securities, US government securities, and corporate debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment whenever
the fair value of an investment is less than amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment's carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. To determine whether an
impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether the
evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes reasons for the impairment, compliance with the
Company's investment policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to year end. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses

        The
Company owned 154 available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2005. Of these 154 securities, there were 71 securities with losses for twelve months or more. 

U.S. Government Securities  

        The unrealized losses on the investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of the U.S. Government agencies were caused by rising interest rates.
Because the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. 

Corporate debt securities  

        The unrealized losses on the investments in corporate bonds were caused by rising interest rates. The corporate bonds held by the Company are high investment
grade and there were no credit events on any of the corporate bonds held. Therefore, the Company does not believe that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the investments. It is expected that the corporate bonds will not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because the Company has the ability to hold
these investments until a recovery of fair

value,
which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. 

        Gross
realized gains and losses for 2005 were $15,000 and $75,000, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses for 2004 were $628,000 and $205,000, respectively. Gross realized gains
for 2003 were $1,249,000. There were no gross realized losses for 2003. Maturities stated are effective maturities. 

F. Restricted Cash  

        At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company held $41,482,000 and $49,847,000, respectively, in restricted cash. At December 31, 2005 and 2004 the
balance was held in deposit with certain banks
predominantly to collateralize conditional stand-by letters of credit in the names of the Company's landlords pursuant to certain operating lease agreements.

        In
2005 and 2004, the Company wrote off certain assets that were fully depreciated and no longer utilized. There was no effect on the Company's net property and equipment. Additionally,
the Company wrote off or sold certain assets that were not fully depreciated. The net loss on disposal of those assets was $344,000 for 2005 and $43,000 for 2004. 


H. Investments  

        In accordance with the Company's policy, as outlined in Note B, "Accounting Policies," the Company assessed its investment in Altus
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Altus"), which it accounts for using the cost method, and determined that there had not been any adjustments to the fair values of that investment which would indicate a
decrease in its fair value below the carrying value that would require the Company to write down the investment basis of the asset, as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The
Company's cost basis carrying value in its outstanding equity and warrants of Altus was $18,863,000 at December 31, 2005 and 2004. 

F-22






<A
NAME="page_fq1067_1_23">  

        Altus completed an initial public offering in January 2006. Vertex owns 817,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,962,494 shares of common
stock. In addition, the Company also holds 450,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock, which are not convertible into common stock and which are redeemable, at Vertex's option on or after
December 31, 2010, or by Altus at any time. The Company is restricted from trading Altus securities for a period of six months following the initial public offering. Due to the public offering,
in 2006 the Company will classify the common stock as an available-for-sale investment and record it at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity, until such gains and losses are realized. The Company will continue to account for the
warrants under the cost method of accounting until the end of the restricted trading period, at which time the warrants will be classified as derivatives with gains or losses based on the fair market
value of the warrants included in the statement of operations. The Company will continue to account for the redeemable preferred stock under the cost method of accounting.

J. Commitments  

        The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company's leases have terms through
April 2018. The term of the Kendall Square lease began January 1, 2003 and lease payments commenced in May 2003. The Company has an obligation, staged through 2006, to build-out
the space into finished laboratory and office space. The lease will expire in 2018 and the Company has the option to extend the term for two consecutive terms of ten years each, ultimately expiring in
2038. The Company expects to occupy and use for its operations approximately 120,000 square feet of the Kendall Square Facility. The Company has sublease arrangements in place for the remaining
rentable square footage of the Kendall Square Facility. See Note D, "Restructuring and Other Expense" for further information.

        Rental
expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $20,427,000, which included $4,669,000 related to the space that the Company intends to occupy in the
Kendall Square Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, rental expense primarily related to facilities, excluding the Kendall Square lease, was $16,303,000, and $15,449,000,
respectively. 

        The
Company has future contractual commitments in connection with its research and development programs. For 2006 and 2007 the amount committed under these contracts is $1,035,000 and
$75,000, respectively. 

        In
connection with the PanVera Asset Sale in 2003 (see Note C, "Sale of Assets"), Vertex agreed to purchase a minimum of $3 million of certain specified products from
Invitrogen annually for three years after the completion of the sale. The estimated losses on the three-year purchase commitment for anticipated payments in excess of the fair value of
products expected to be purchased
have been booked against the gain on the sale and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets. 

K. Convertible Subordinated Notes  

        On February 13, 2004, the Company issued approximately $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due in February 2011 (the "February 2011 Notes") in exchange for an equal principal amount of its outstanding 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due in September 2007 (the "2007
Notes"). On September 17, 2004, the Company issued approximately $79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in February 2011
(the "September 2011 Notes") in exchange for an equal principal amount of its 2007 Notes. The terms of the September 2011 Notes are identical to those of the February 2011 Notes
(the February 2011 Notes and the September 2011 Notes are referred to together as the "2011 Notes"). 

        The
2011 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2011 Notes
bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2011 Notes on February 15
and August 15 of each year. On or after February 15, 2007, the Company may redeem the 2011 Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any. The deferred issuance costs associated with 

F-24




 


the
issuance of the 2011 Notes, which are classified as long-term other assets, were approximately $3.0 million for the February 2011 Notes and $1.9 million for the
September 2011 Notes. 

        The
2007 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a price equal to $92.26 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 Notes
bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2007 Notes on March 19 and
September 19 of each year. The 2007 Notes are redeemable by the Company at any time at specific redemption prices if the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds 120% of the
conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The deferred issuance costs associated with the original sale of the 2007 Notes were $9.3 million. 


        As
a result of the 2004 exchanges of the 2007 Notes for 2011 Notes, the Company recorded a charge on the retirement of $153.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007
Notes in February 2004 in the amount of $2.5 million, and a charge on the retirement of $79.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes in September 2004 in
the amount of $1.0 million. These charges represent that portion of the unamortized deferred issuance costs applicable to the amount of 2007 Notes retired. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, $1.0 million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance costs of the remaining 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
$1.3 million was amortized to interest expense for the issuance costs of the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2003, $1.4 million was amortized to
interest expense for the issuance costs associated with the 2007 Notes. 

        In
September 2005, the Company issued approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock to certain holders of 2007 Notes in exchange for approximately $40.5 million in
aggregate principal amount of those notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the Company incurred a non-cash charge of $36.3 million. This charge is related to the
incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2007 Notes under their original terms, at the original conversion price of $92.26. The
following items related to the exchange were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets: accrued interest of approximately $1.0 million;
remaining unamortized issuance costs of the exchanged 2007 Notes of approximately $0.3 million; and $0.1 million of issuance costs of the common stock. 

        In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company issued approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock to certain holders of 2011 Notes in exchange for approximately
$114.5 million in aggregate principal amount of those notes, plus accrued interest. As a result of the exchange, the Company incurred a non-cash charge of $11.9 million. This
charge is related to the incremental shares issued in the transaction over the number that would have been issued upon conversion of the 2011 Notes under their original terms, at the original
conversion price of $14.94. The following items related to the exchange were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets: accrued interest of
approximately $2.0 million; remaining unamortized issuance costs of the exchanged 2011 Notes of approximately $1.8 million; and $0.2 million of issuance costs of the common stock. 

        At
December 31, 2005, there was approximately $42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes and approximately $118.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of the 2011 Notes outstanding. At December 31, 2005, the 2007 Notes and the 2011 Notes had a fair value of $40.5 million and $227.0 million, respectively, as obtained from
a quoted market source.

L. Equity Offering  

        In June 2005, the Company completed a public offering of 13,512,500 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' over-allotment of
1,762,500 shares, at a price of $13.00 per share. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $165.4 million to the Company. The net proceeds include $10.3 million of
stock offering costs which were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 

M. Income Taxes  

        For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there is no provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations. 

        The
Company's federal statutory income tax rate for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was 34%. The Company has incurred losses from operations but has not recorded an income tax benefit for 2005,
2004, and 2003, as the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to the realizability of these tax
assets. 

        The
difference between the Company's "expected" tax provision (benefit), as computed by applying the U.S federal corporate tax rate of 34% to (loss) before provision for income taxes,
and actual tax is reconciled as follows (in thousands):

        For
federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,042,065,000, and $22,122,000 of tax credits, which
may be used to offset future federal income and tax liability, respectively. For state income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $576,315,000, and
8,819,000 of tax credits, which may be used to offset future state income and tax liability, respectively. These operating loss carryforwards began to expire in 2005, and the tax credit carryforwards
began to expire in 2004. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the 2005 net deferred tax asset
since it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

        Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are

        Of
the $459,608,000 valuation allowance at December 31, 2005, $111,672,000 relates to deductions for nonqualified stock options, which will be credited to additional
paid-in capital, if realized. 

        Ownership
changes, as defined by Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of net operating losses and research and experimentation credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually
to offset future taxable income and taxes payable. 

N. Common and Preferred Stock  

Common Stock  

Stock and Option Plans  

        The Company has a 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Plan"), a 1994 Stock and Option Plan (the "1994 Plan") and a 1996 Stock and Option Plan (the "1996 Plan")
(together, the "Plans"). Stock options may be granted under the Plans either as options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" ("ISOs") under the Internal Revenue Code or as
non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"). Under the 1991 Plan, stock options may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and to consultants of the Company
(NQSOs only). Under the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan, stock rights, which may be (i) ISOs when Internal Revenue Code requirements are met, (ii) NQSOs, or (iii) shares of common
stock or the opportunity to make a direct purchase of shares of common stock ("Stock Awards"), may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are employees) and consultants,
advisors and non-employee directors (NQSOs and stock awards only). Under the 1991 Plan and the 1994 Plan, ISOs may be granted at a price not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of the grant, and NQSOs may be granted at an exercise price established by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which may be less than,
equal to or greater than the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Stock options granted under the 1996 Plan may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Vesting is ratable over specified periods for all plans, is generally four or five years, and is determined by the Management Development and 

F-27




 


Compensation
Committee. ISOs granted under the Plans must expire not more than ten years from the date of grant. 

        The
Company has reserved 8,000,000 shares under the 1991 Plan and 1994 Plan. The Company reserved 22,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1996 Plan, of which 5,500,000 were reserved
during 2001 and 6,000,000 were reserved in 2002. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 3,090,000 shares of common stock available for future grants under the 1996 Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation  

        The Company grants restricted shares to employees, at a price per share equal to the par value of the Company's common stock, or $0.01 per share. In general, the
restricted shares vest over four years in four equal annual installments. 

        During
2005, the Company issued approximately 616,000 restricted shares to employees. The shares had an average fair value on dates of grant of $13.77. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had approximately 1,521,000 restricted shares unvested and outstanding. 


        During
2004, the Company issued approximately 1,369,000 restricted shares to employees. The shares had an average fair value on dates of grant of $9.39. Included in the total number of
restricted shares
issued is a one-time grant of approximately 923,000 shares to senior managers and executives on May 6, 2004. Under the terms of the one-time grant to senior managers and
executives, the restricted shares vest in two increments: 50% on May 6, 2007 (the three year anniversary of the grant), and the balance on May 6, 2009 or earlier, upon the Company
achieving profitability, as measured under specified criteria applied by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 1,399,000 restricted shares unvested and
outstanding. 

        The
Company has recorded deferred compensation, net of cancellations, of approximately $6,172,000 and $12,206,000 related to the issuance of restricted shares during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $4,421,000, $1,661,000, and $16,000 for the twelve months ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, related to all restricted shares outstanding during those periods. 

        The
Company records and amortizes over the related vesting periods deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted or the price per
share of restricted stock issued, and the fair value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant or issuance. There was no deferred compensation expense related to stock options in 2005, 2004
and 2003. 

F-29




 


        For
the year ended December 31, 2005 the Company recorded $211,000 in compensation expense related to stock and option grants in accordance with executives' severance agreements. 


        Compensation
cost, calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, recognized in connection with the issuance of stock options to nonemployees was $161,826 in 2003. There was no
compensation cost recognized in 2005 and 2004 related to the issuance of stock options to nonemployees. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

        On July 1, 1992, Vertex adopted the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Vertex Purchase Plan"), which has been
subsequently amended to add additional shares to the pool of available shares under the plan, including an amendment in 2002 to add 600,000 shares and an amendment in 2004 to add
1,500,000 shares. The Vertex Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to enroll in a twelve-month offering period comprising two six-month purchase periods. Participants may purchase shares of
the Company's common stock, through payroll deductions, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable twelve-month offering period, or the
last day of the applicable six-month purchase period, whichever is lower. 

        During
2005, 2004, and 2003 the following shares were issued to employees under the Vertex Purchase Plan (shares in thousands):

Rights  

        Each Vertex shareholder also holds one share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of common stock owned. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the
Company one half of one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "Junior Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $135 per
one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share subject to adjustment (the "Purchase Price"). The Rights are not exercisable until after the acquisition by a person or group of 15%
or more of the outstanding common stock (an "Acquiring Person"), or after the announcement of an intention to make or commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would
result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates being called the 

F-30




 


"Distribution
Date"). Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be traded with, and only with, the common stock. Until a Right is exercised, the
Right will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a stockholder. 

        If
any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise and payment of the Purchase Price that number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price and, if the Company is acquired in a business combination
transaction or 50% or more of its assets are sold, each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise and payment of the Purchase Price that number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company which at the time of the transaction will have a market value of two times the Purchase Price. 

        At
any time after any person becomes an acquiring person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of
the Company may cause the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group) to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for common stock or Junior Preferred Shares, at an exchange rate of one share
of common stock per Right or one half of one-hundredth of a Junior Preferred Share per Right. 

        At
any time prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the
Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right. 

        The
Rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in that they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in Vertex on terms not
approved by the Board of Directors. 

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance  

        At December 31, 2005, the Company has reserved shares of common stock for future issuance under all equity compensation plans as follows (shares in
thousands): 




Common stock under stock and option plans

O. Significant Revenue Arrangements  

        The Company has formed strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other organizations in the areas of drug discovery, development, and
commercialization. Research, development and commercialization agreements provide the Company with financial support and other valuable resources for its research programs and for the development of
clinical drug candidates, and the marketing and sales of products. 


Collaborative Research, Development and Commercialization Agreements  

        In the Company's collaborative research, development and commercialization programs the Company seeks to discover, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical
products in conjunction with and supported by the Company's collaborators. Collaborative research and development arrangements may provide research funding over an initial contract period with renewal
and termination options that 

F-31




 


vary
by agreement. The agreements may also include milestone payments based on the achievement of a pre-agreed objective or the occurrence of a designated event. The agreements may also
contain development reimbursement provisions, royalty rights or profit sharing rights and manufacturing options. The Company has entered into significant research and development collaborations under
terms which vary from agreement to agreement. 

Novartis  

        In May 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG ("Novartis") to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization
of small molecule drugs directed at protein kinases. The agreement was amended in February 2004. Under the original agreement, the Company was responsible for drug discovery and clinical
proof-of-concept testing of all drug candidates. Novartis agreed to pay the Company up to $200 million in research funding through April 2006, and to loan the
Company up to $200 million on a non-interest-bearing basis to support clinical proof-of-concept studies. Development loans with respect to any drug
candidates accepted by Novartis for development would be forgiven. Under the amended agreement, Vertex will continue to receive research funding through April 2006 along with development
milestone payments and royalties with respect to any drug candidates selected by Novartis for development. Novartis holds an option to develop drug candidates meeting certain pre-agreed
criteria. The option is exercisable with respect to each development candidate at the pre-development stage, at which point a $10 million milestone payment will be due from
Novartis, with up to $25 million in additional pre-commercial milestone payments. Following completion of the six-year research term in April 2006, Novartis' development
option with respect to all compounds discovered in the research program will terminate no later than the end of a specified period following delivery by Vertex to Novartis of a final research report.
Vertex retains all rights to any candidate not selected by Novartis, as well as to all of the intellectual property it generates under the collaboration that is not specific to candidates selected by
Novartis for development. As part of the amended agreement, restrictions under the original agreement that limited Novartis' right to pursue kinase research and development outside the collaboration
were removed, and the development loan facility was terminated. In November 2004, Novartis accepted VX-322 for preclinical development and made a $10 million milestone
payment to Vertex that is being recognized as revenue over the term of the contract. Novartis will have exclusive worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to
VX-322 and any other drug candidates that it accepts from the Company for development. The Company will receive royalties on any products that are marketed as part of the collaboration. In
2005, 2004, and 2003, the
Company recognized approximately $53.1 million, $50.5 million and $44.5 million, respectively, in revenue under this agreement. 

        Under
the amended agreement, the Company retained the right either to develop VX-680 to proof-of-concept under the terms of the original agreement, or
to elect to remove VX-680, and the Aurora kinases it targets, from the collaboration. On June 22, 2004, the Company exercised its election to develop VX-680 outside the
Novartis collaboration and repaid approximately $12.5 million of unspent and uncommitted development loans previously advanced on account of VX-680. Loans advanced under the
original agreement for the early development of certain other compounds will be forgiven on a compound-by-compound basis if any of those compounds are selected by Novartis for
development. All loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable, without interest, in May 2008. At December 31, 2005, there were approximately $20 million in remaining
loans outstanding under the loan facility.

GlaxoSmithKline  

        In December 1993, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline entered into a collaborative agreement to research, develop and commercialize HIV protease inhibitors,
including Agenerase (amprenavir), Lexiva/Telzir (fosamprenavir calcium) and brecanavir (VX-385). Under the collaborative agreement, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay the Company up to
$42 million, comprised of a $15 million up-front license payment made in 1993, $14 million of product research funding over five years and $13 million of
development and commercialization milestone payments for an initial drug candidate. Research funding under this agreement ended on December 31, 1998 and Vertex has received the entire
$42 million referenced above plus additional milestones for the second and third generation drug candidates Lexiva/Telzir and brecanavir. Vertex is also entitled to royalties on sales of its
HIV protease inhibitors by GlaxoSmithKline. The Company began earning a royalty from GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 on sales of Agenerase, in the fourth quarter of 2003 on sales of Lexiva, and in the third
quarter of 2004 on sales of Telzir. GlaxoSmithKline is also obligated to pay additional development and commercialization milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates, including brecanavir. 

        In
the fourth quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $1 million based on the initiation of Phase II clinical trials for brecanavir. In the third
quarter of 2004, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $1.5 million in connection with the regulatory approval of Telzir in the European Union. In the fourth quarter of 2003,
GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a milestone payment of $2.5 million upon FDA approval of Lexiva in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2002, GlaxoSmithKline paid the Company a
milestone payment of $1.5 million in connection with the submission of a new drug application for marketing approval of Lexiva/Telzir in the United States and the European Union. 

        GlaxoSmithKline
is required to bear the costs of developing drug candidates in its territory under the collaboration. Under the original agreement, GlaxoSmithKline had exclusive rights
to develop and commercialize Vertex's HIV protease inhibitors in all parts of the world except the Far East. In 2003, the Company amended the agreement to add the Far East to GlaxoSmithKline's
territory for development and commercialization of Lexiva/Telzir. The Company has retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain product educational rights in territories licensed to
GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline has the right to terminate its arrangement with the Company without cause upon twelve months' notice. Termination of the agreement by GlaxoSmithKline will relieve it
of its obligation to make further commercialization and development milestone and royalty payments and will end any license granted to GlaxoSmithKline by Vertex under the agreement. 

        In
June 1996, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain G.D. Searle & Co. ("Searle," now owned by
Pharmacia/Pfizer) patents in the area of HIV protease inhibition. The Company pays Searle a royalty based on sales of Agenerase and Lexiva/Telzir. 

        In
the fourth quarter of 2005, GlaxoSmithKline and the Company entered into a collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize VX-409, Vertex's novel, subtype selective
sodium channel modulator for the treatment of pain. Under the terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline has the exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize VX-409 and certain
back-up compounds worldwide. Vertex received a $20 million up-front license payment and could receive up to $385 million in additional development and commercial
milestone payments based on the development of VX-409 and back-up compounds in major pharmaceutical markets across a range of indications. GlaxoSmithKline will also pay Vertex
royalties on annual sales. 

        Revenues
and royalties earned from GlaxoSmithKline under both agreements were $52.8 million, $19.8 million, and $11.5 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated (CFFT)  

        In May 2004, Vertex entered into an agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT") that provided funding through
December 31, 2005 for Vertex's late-stage cystic fibrosis drug discovery effort. Under this agreement, Vertex will retain the right to develop and commercialize any compounds
discovered in the course of the research collaboration. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Vertex recognized $14.5 million and $6.8 million in revenue related
to this agreement. During the first quarter of 2004, under an earlier agreement, Vertex earned revenue of $1.9 million. 

        In
January 2006, Vertex and CFFT extended the duration of their research collaboration. Under the extended agreement, CFFT has agreed to provide an additional $22 million
to Vertex for continued research funding through early 2008 directed toward CFTR corrector compounds. CFFT has the right to terminate the agreement without cause, effective on June 30, 2006 and
June 30, 2007, upon 60 days' prior written notice. 

Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation  

        In June 2004, Vertex entered into a collaboration agreement with Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation, which will provide financial and other support for the
development of VX-950, the Company's oral hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi has the right to develop and commercialize VX-950
in Japan and certain other Far East countries, while Vertex has retained exclusive development and marketing rights to VX-950 in the rest of the world, including North America and Europe.
The agreement provides for up to $33 million in payments by Mitsubishi to Vertex through Phase II clinical development, including an up-front license fee, development stage
milestone payments and contributions to certain drug development costs for VX-950. Further cost sharing beyond Phase II clinical
development will be determined by Mitsubishi and Vertex based on the design of registration studies for VX-950. The agreement also provides Vertex with royalties on any sales of
VX-950 in the Mitsubishi territory. Mitsubishi may terminate the agreement at any time without cause upon 60 days' prior written notice. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Mitsubishi
paid the Company a milestone payment of $4 million for first dosing of VX-950 in a patient in the Phase Ib clinical trial in the United States. Vertex recognized $3.4 million
and $1.8 million of non-milestone revenue in 2005 and 2004, respectively, under the Mitsubishi agreement, primarily for reimbursement of Vertex's expenses incurred in
VX-950 development. 

Merck & Co., Inc.  

        In June 2004, Vertex entered into a global collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. to develop and commercialize VX-680, Vertex's
lead Aurora kinase inhibitor, and possibly additional follow-on compound(s), for the treatment of cancer. The Merck collaboration provides for an up-front license payment of
$20 million, which was made in June 2004, and for research funding of $14 million over two years, ending in June 2006. In addition, Vertex could receive as much as
$350 million in milestone payments, including up to $130 million for the successful development of VX-680 in the first oncology indication and additional milestone payments
for development of VX-680 and follow-on compounds in subsequent major oncology indications. Merck is responsible for worldwide clinical development and commercialization of
VX-680 and any other Aurora kinase inhibitors discovered during the research program and will pay Vertex royalties on product sales. Merck may terminate the agreement without cause at any
time upon 90 days' advance written notice, except that six months' advance written notice 

F-34




 


is
required for termination during the second year of the research term (ending June 2006) or at any time when a product has marketing approval in a major market and the termination is not the result
of a safety issue. Vertex recognized $17.1 million and $8.4 million of revenue related to research support and the up-front license payment for this collaboration in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. 

        In
the fourth quarter of 2005, Vertex received a $7.5 million milestone payment from Merck upon the demonstration of activity by VX-680 on a clinically relevant biomarker during a
Phase I clinical trial. Vertex recognized revenue of $5.6 million in 2005 related to this milestone. The remainder will be recognized over the remaining contract term. 


        In
addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, Merck selected a follow-on compound (VX-667) for development. Merck paid the Company a milestone payment of $12 million
upon the selection of the follow-on compound. Vertex recognized revenue of $1.7 million in 2005 related to this milestone. The remainder will be recognized over the remaining
contract term. 

Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  

        The Company and Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("Kissei") are parties to an agreement to collaborate on the identification of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase
and the development of those compounds as novel, orally active drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and neurological diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Kissei agreed to pay the Company up
to $22 million comprised of a $4 million up-front license payment, $11 million of product research funding over three years and $7 million of development and
commercialization milestone payments. Additionally, Kissei agreed to reimburse the Company for certain development costs, including a portion of costs for Phase II trials of VX-702.
Research funding ended under this program on June 30, 2000 and the Company has received the full amount of research funding specified under the agreement. Kissei has exclusive rights to develop
and commercialize VX-702 in Japan and certain Far East countries and co-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. The Company retains exclusive marketing rights outside the Far
East and co-exclusive rights in China, Taiwan and South Korea. In addition, the Company will have the right to supply bulk drug material to Kissei for sale in its territory and will
receive royalties or drug supply payments on future product sales, if any. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $7.3 million, $3.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, was
recognized as revenue under the p38 MAP kinase research and development program. The $7.3 million of revenue recognized in 2005 includes a $2.5 million milestone paid upon Kissei's
completion of regulatory filings in preparation for Phase I clinical development of VX-702 in Japan. 

P. Employee Benefits  

        The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (the "Vertex 401(k) Plan") in which substantially all of its permanent employees are eligible to participate.
Participants may contribute up to 60% of their annual compensation to the Vertex 401(k) Plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company may declare discretionary matching contributions to the
Vertex 401(k) Plan that are payable in the form of Vertex common stock. The match is paid in the form of fully vested interests in a Vertex common stock

Q. Related Party Transactions  

        As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had an interest-free loan outstanding to an officer in the amount of $36,000 and $97,000,
respectively, which was initially advanced in April 2002. The loan balance is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

        In
2001, the Company entered into a four year consulting agreement with a director of the Company for the provision of part-time consulting services over a period of four
years, at the rate of $80,000 per year commencing in January 2002 and terminating in January 2006. 

R. Contingencies  

        The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. 


        On
December 17, 2003, a purported class action, Marguerite Sacchetti v. James C. Blair et al., was filed in the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of San Diego, naming as defendants all of the
directors of Aurora who approved the merger of Aurora and Vertex, which closed in July 2001. The plaintiffs claim that Aurora's directors breached their fiduciary duty to Aurora by, among other
things, negligently conducting a due diligence examination of Vertex by failing to discover alleged problems with VX-745, a Vertex drug candidate that was the subject of a development
program which was terminated by Vertex in September 2001. Vertex has certain indemnity obligations to Aurora's directors under the terms of the merger agreement between Vertex and Aurora, which
could result in Vertex liability for attorney's fees and costs in connection with this action, as well as for any ultimate judgment that might be awarded. There is an outstanding directors' and
officers' liability policy which may cover a significant portion of any such liability. The defendants are vigorously defending this suit. The Company believes this suit will be settled without any
significant liability to Vertex or the former Aurora directors. 

S. Guarantees  

        As permitted under Massachusetts law, Vertex's Articles of Organization and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify certain of its officers and directors
for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or director. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under
these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, the Company has purchased certain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies that reduce its monetary exposure and enable it to
recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 

F-36




 


        Vertex
customarily agrees in the ordinary course of its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators and sites in its drug development
programs, in sponsored research agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for the Company
in the ordinary course of business, and in its real estate leases. The Company also customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery and development collaboration
agreements. With respect to the Company's clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the
investigator's institution relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical
testing of the Company's compounds or drug candidates. With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal
injury or property damage caused by the Company, to violations of law by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company's contractual obligations. The indemnification provisions appearing in the
Company's collaboration agreements are similar, but in addition provide some limited indemnification for its collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual
property rights. In each of the cases above, the indemnification obligation generally survives the termination of the agreement for some extended period, although the obligation typically has the most
relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions is
generally unlimited. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and general liability that reduce its
exposure for indemnification and would enable it in many cases to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims
related to these indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 

        Effective
on March 28, 2003 the Company sold certain assets of PanVera LLC to Invitrogen Corporation for approximately $97 million. The agreement with Invitrogen requires
the Company to indemnify Invitrogen against any loss it may suffer by reason of Vertex's breach of certain representations and warranties, or failure to perform certain covenants, contained in the
agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations under the indemnity are, with a few exceptions which
the Company believes are not material, capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing (which
period has ended) although there is no corresponding time limit for claims made based on breaches of covenants. Invitrogen has made no claims to date under this indemnity, and the Company believes
that the estimated fair value of the remaining indemnification obligation is minimal. 

        Effective
on December 3, 2003, the Company sold certain instrumentation assets to Aurora Discovery, Inc. for approximately $4.3 million. The agreement with Aurora
Discovery, Inc. requires the Company to indemnify Aurora Discovery, Inc. against any loss it may suffer by reason of the Company's breach of certain representations and warranties, or
failure to perform certain covenants, contained in the agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company's aggregate obligations
under the indemnity are capped at one-half of the purchase price, and apply to claims under representations and warranties made within fifteen months after closing (which period has ended)

this
indemnity, and the Company believes that the estimated fair value of the remaining indemnification obligation is minimal. 


        On
February 10, 2004, Vertex entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities LLC in connection with the exchange of approximately $153.1 million of the
February 2011 Notes for approximately $153.1 million of 2007 Notes. On September 13, 2004, the Company entered into a second Dealer Manager Agreement with UBS Securities in

the 2011 Notes, the omission of any material fact needed to make those materials not misleading, and any actions taken by the Company or its representatives in connection with the exchanges. The
representations, warranties and covenants in the Dealer Manager Agreements are of a type customary in agreements of this sort. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification
obligations is minimal. 

        On

believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
