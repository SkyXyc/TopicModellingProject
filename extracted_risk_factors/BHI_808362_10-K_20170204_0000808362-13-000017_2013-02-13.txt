ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves various risks.  When considering an investment in Baker Hughes, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this report.  There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial.  Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in Baker Hughes.Risk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas IndustryOur business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact, either positively or negatively, the markets for oil and natural gas.  Expenditures by our customers for exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, the risks associated with developing the reserves, their ability to finance exploration for and development of reserves, and the future value of the reserves.  Their evaluation of the future value is based, in part, on their expectations for global demand, global supply, excess production capacity, inventory levels, and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices.  The key risk factors we believe are currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.  Changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results.Demand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services, is highly correlated with global economic growth, and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East who are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average.  The most recent slowdown in global economic growth and recession in the developed economies resulted in reduced demand for oil and natural gas, increased spare productive capacity and lower energy prices.  Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets or a continuation of the European sovereign debt crisis could reduce our customers’ spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results.  Incremental weakness in global economic activity, particularly in China, India, Europe, the Middle East and developing countries in Asia, will reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices.  Incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices.  In addition, demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation, including “cap and trade” legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations.Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services.  Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities.  Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers.  While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers.  Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk.  Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.Our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments and 10Table of Contents                                resulting returns.  Limited access to external sources of funding has and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally-generated cash flow.  In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.Supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.Productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate.  The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.  Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation in the future.Access to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect.Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced.Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries, including, but not limited to, Norway and Russia, are willing and able to control production and exports of oil, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives.  Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Changes in spare productive capacity or inventory levels can be indicative of future customer spending to explore for and develop oil and natural gas which in turn influences the demand for our products and services.Spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand.  High or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften.  Low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise.  Measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand (“spare productive capacity”) are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies.  When spare productive capacity is low compared to demand, energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile, reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption.Seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.Variation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand.  Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.  Extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.11Table of Contents                                Risk Factors Related to Our BusinessOur expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors:We operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.We operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel.  Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers.  In order to be competitive, we must provide new technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers, and successfully recruit and train competent personnel.  Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services.Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results.  Development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results.We may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.The high cost or unavailability of infrastructure, materials, equipment, supplies and personnel, particularly in periods of rapid growth, could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories.  Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts.  Raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys (including chromium and nickel), titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks.  Our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers.  A lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog, which may limit our ability to respond to short lead time orders.People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world.  Our ability to manage the recruiting, training, retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business.  A well-trained, motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business.  Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and retain our employees, while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate.  Likewise, when there is a downturn in the economy or our markets, we may have to adjust our workforce to control costs and yet not lose our skilled and diverse workforce.  Labor-related actions, including strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business.Our business is subject to geopolitical and terrorism threats.Geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we do business.  Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.Uncertainties in Venezuela have impacted the collection of accounts receivable and could further impact our business operations.We are not able to predict how uncertainties in Venezuela may impact further collection of accounts receivable 12Table of Contents                                and our ability to continue operations.  We continue to experience delays in receiving payments from our customers in Venezuela.  As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable in Venezuela were approximately 6% of our total accounts receivable (after any provision for doubtful accounts).  For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue in Venezuela was approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue.  In addition, our operations in Venezuela could be impacted by any further devaluation of the local currency or other action of the Venezuelan government that impedes our ability to conduct operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.Threats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.  It is also possible that breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time.  Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers’ operations, loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.Our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.We entered into settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC in April 2007 relating to violations of the FCPA by the Company.  Our ability to comply with the FCPA is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees.  Our compliance program is also dependent on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the Baker Hughes Business Code of Conduct.  We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of an additional violation of the FCPA by us or any of our employees.Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results.We have operations in the U.S. and in more than 80 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate.  Our ability to manage our compliance costs and compliance programs will impact our ability to meet our earnings goals.  Compliance related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries.  Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate.Changes in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results.Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact operating results.  In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.  If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially impacted.Our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters.  These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts.  We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law.  Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.Changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling has and may continue to adversely affect our business and operating results and reduce the need for our services in those areas.New and proposed legislation and regulation in the U.S. and other parts of the world of the offshore oil and natural gas industry may result in substantial increases in costs or delays in drilling or other operations in the Gulf of 13Table of Contents                                Mexico and other parts of the world, oil and natural gas projects becoming potentially non-economic, and a corresponding reduced demand for our services.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the prior moratorium or the substance or effect of any new or additional regulations.  If the U.S. or other countries where we operate, enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling or contracting services operations, including without limitation cementing, higher operating costs could result and adversely affect our business and operating results.If the Company were to be involved in a future incident similar to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident, the Company could suffer significant financial losses that could severely impair the Company.  Protections available to the Company through contractual terms and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect the Company in the event we were involved in that type of an incident.Uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results.We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings.  We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available; however, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation.  This insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions.  The insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices.  In addition, the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage:•we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;•we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;•our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or•the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.Whenever possible, we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability.  However, state law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of the agreement with the customer may not recognize those limitations of liability and/or limit the customer’s indemnity obligations to the Company.  In addition, insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks from an event, like a well blow out that can lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment.  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.Compliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.Our business is impacted by unexpected outcomes or material changes in environmental laws, rulings and litigation.  Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws, including (without limitation) our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are only our forecasts regarding these matters.  These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose new restrictions on air emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; more stringent enforcement of existing environmental regulations; a change in our allocation or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a PRP, including (without limitation) Superfund sites; the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials.International, national, and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  In the U.S., the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” rule established in 2010 provided a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions.  Furthermore, the EPA has issued additional GHG reporting rules specifically for the oil and natural gas industry, which now include mobile as well as stationary GHG emission sources.  These rules are expected to apply to some of our wellsite equipment and 14Table of Contents                                operations in the future.  The EPA has also published a final rule, the “Endangerment Finding,” indicating that GHGs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions of GHGs from mobile sources also contribute.  Following issuance of the Endangerment Finding, the EPA also promulgated final motor vehicle GHG emission standards on April 1, 2010.International developments focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol” (an internationally applied protocol, which has been ratified in Canada) and the European Union’s Emission Trading System.  The Carbon Reduction Commitment in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) is the first cap and trade scheme to affect Baker Hughes’ facilities.  Domestic cap and trade programs include the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern U.S. and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative in the western U.S.Current or future legislation, regulations and developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.Demand for pressure pumping services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law.Some federal, state and foreign governmental bodies have adopted laws and regulations or are considering legislative and regulatory proposals that, if signed into law, would among other things require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations and would subject hydraulic fracturing to more stringent regulation with respect to, for example, construction standards for wells intended for hydraulic fracturing, certifications concerning the conduct of hydraulic fracturing operations, management of flowback waters from hydraulic fracturing operations, or other measures intended to prevent operational hazards.  Such federal, state or foreign legislation and/or regulations could impair our operations, increase our operating costs, and/or greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company’s pressure pumping services.  The EPA and other governmental bodies are studying hydraulic fracturing operations.  Government actions relating to the development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources may impede the development of these resources by our customers, delaying or reducing the demand for our services.  We are unable to predict whether the proposed changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations.Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies.  State-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as joint ventures, that could be difficult or undesirable for the Company to meet.  The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the Company’s operations in those countries.  In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.In addition, many state-owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts that could require the Company to provide services outside its core business.  Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally requires the Company to assume additional risks.Currency fluctuations may impact our operating results.Fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business.  Most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in U.S. Dollars or local currency indexed to U.S. Dollars; however, some of our revenue, local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in U.S. Dollars and may impact our results of operations.15Table of Contents                                Changes in economic conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.The condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary.  If the Company’s credit rating is downgraded, this would increase borrowing costs under our credit facility and commercial paper program, as well as the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew or obtain or issue new debt financing.Changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases.To the extent the Company engages in stock repurchases, such activity is subject to market conditions, such as the trading prices for our stock, as well as the terms of any stock purchase plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.  Management, in its discretion, may engage in or discontinue stock repurchases at any time.Over one-half of the Company’s revenue and profit before tax are attributable to North America.During the year ended December 31, 2012, over one-half of our revenue and profit before tax were attributable to North America.  In North America, a decrease in demand for energy or in oil and natural gas exploration and production, or an increase in competition could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results.ITEM 1B
