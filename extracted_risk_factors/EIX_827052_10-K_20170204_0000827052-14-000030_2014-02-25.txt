. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company—Regulatory Risks."In the area of transmission infrastructure, SCE may experience increased competition from merchant transmission providers. The FERC has made changes to its transmission planning requirements with the goal of opening transmission development to competition from independent developers. In July 2011, the FERC adopted new rules that remove incumbent public utility transmission owners' federally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities. The rules direct regional entities, such as ISOs, to create new processes that would allow other providers to develop certain types of new transmission projects. The CAISO filed its processes, as required by the rule, with the FERC in October 2012. The FERC has not yet approved all of these processes. The majority of SCE's 2013 – 2014 transmission capital forecast relates to transmission projects that have been approved by the CAISO and barring a re-evaluation under the new rules, will not be subject to the new processes. The impact of the new rules on future transmission projects will depend on the processes ultimately implemented by regional entities.PropertiesSCE supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks. Its transmission facilities, which include sub-transmission facilities and are located primarily in California but also in Nevada and Arizona, deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of lines ranging from 33 kV to 500 kV and substations. SCE's distribution system, which takes power from substations to customers, includes over 53,000 line miles of overhead lines, 37,000 line miles of underground lines and approximately 800 distribution substations, all of which are located in California. SCE owns the generating facilities listed in the following table:Generating Facility Location(in CA, unlessotherwise noted) Fuel Type Operator SCE'sOwnershipInterest (%)Net PhysicalCapacity(in MW) SCE's Capacitypro rata share(in MW)Hydroelectric Plants (36) Various Hydroelectric SCE 100%1,176  1,176 Pebbly Beach Generating Station Catalina Island Diesel SCE 100%9  9 Mountainview Units 3 and 4 Redlands Natural Gas SCE 100%1,050  1,050 Peaker Plants (5) Various Gas fueled, Combustion Turbine SCE 100%245  245 Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Phoenix, AZ Nuclear APS 15.8%3,739  591 Solar PV Plants (25) Various Photovoltaic SCE 100%91  91 Total        6,310  3,162 In June 2013, SCE decided to permanently retire the remaining Units at San Onofre. For more information, see "Management Overview—Permanent Retirement of San Onofre " in the MD&A.On December 30, 2013, SCE completed the sale of its interest in Four Corners to APS. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for more information.9San Onofre and certain of SCE's substations, and portions of its transmission, distribution and communication systems are located on lands owned by the federal, state or local governments under licenses, permits, easements or leases, or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises. Certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate SCE, under specified circumstances and at its expense, to relocate such transmission, distribution, and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal, state, or local governments. In particular, the easement granted by the U.S. Navy for San Onofre gives the Navy the right to set site-restoration requirements, which could exceed the NRC requirements and require SCE to restore the site to its original condition. The majority of SCE's hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs are located in whole or in part on U.S.-owned lands and are subject to FERC licenses. Slightly over half of these plants have FERC licenses that expire at various times between 2021 and 2046. SCE continuously monitors and maintains these licenses. FERC licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on SCE, including the right of the United States to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation. When existing licenses expire, the FERC has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications, but only if their license application is superior to SCE's and then only upon payment of specified compensation to SCE. New licenses issued to SCE are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the FERC to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process. Substantially all of SCE's properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements."SeasonalityDue to warm weather during the summer months and SCE's rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than the other quarters.ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION OF EDISON INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIESLegislative and regulatory activities by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States relating to energy and the environment impose numerous restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities by Edison International's subsidiaries, as well as the cost of mitigating the environmental impacts of past operations. The environmental regulations and other developments discussed below may impact SCE's fossil-fuel fired power plants and fossil-fuel power plants owned by others that SCE purchases power from, and accordingly, the discussion in this section focuses mainly on regulations applicable to California. For more information on environmental risks, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company—Environmental Risks."Edison International and SCE continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments and to evaluate possible strategies for compliance with environmental regulations. Additional information about environmental matters affecting Edison International and its subsidiaries, including projected environmental capital expenditures, is included in the MD&A under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources—SCE—Capital Investment Plan" and in "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies—Environmental Remediation." Air QualityThe CAA, which regulates air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources, has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel plants. The CAA requires the US EPA to establish concentration levels in the ambient air for six criteria pollutants to protect public health and welfare. These concentration levels are known as NAAQS. The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2.Federal environmental regulations of these criteria pollutants require states to adopt state implementation plans, known as SIPs, for certain pollutants, which detail how the state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation. The SIPs must be equal to or more stringent than the federal requirements and must be submitted to the US EPA for approval. Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas), and must develop a SIP both to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas. If the attainment status of areas changes, states may be required to develop new SIPs that address the changes. Much of southern California is in a non-attainment area for several criteria pollutants.National Ambient Air Quality StandardsIn 2010, the US EPA proposed a revision to the primary and secondary NAAQS for 8-hour ozone that it had finalized in 2008. The 8-hour ozone standard established in 2008 was 0.075 parts per million but the implementation process must be completed before the 0.075 parts-per-million standard can be enforced. The US EPA issued initial area designations of attainment, nonattainment, and unclassifiable areas across the nation in 2012. Areas in SCE's service area were classified in 10various degrees of nonattainment, including the greater Los Angeles area (known as the South Coast Air Basin), which was designated as extreme nonattainment; Kern County (marginal nonattainment); Riverside County (severe nonattainment); Ventura County (serious nonattainment); and the San Joaquin Valley (extreme nonattainment). California is in the process of developing air quality management plans and updating its state implementation plan to outline how compliance with the 2008 NAAQS will be achieved. The implementation plans may call for more stringent restrictions on air emissions, which could further increase the difficulty of siting new natural gas fired generation in Southern California.Water QualityClean Water ActRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for many of SCE's construction projects, and govern critical parameters at generating facilities, such as the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design, and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. Federal standards intended to protect aquatic organisms by reducing capture in the screens attached to cooling water intake structures (impingement) at generating facilities and the water volume brought into the facilities (entrainment) are expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2014. Due to the decision to permanently retire San Onofre Units 2 and 3, SCE will seek relief from the federal standards in order to avoid material capital expenditures at San Onofre. California Restriction on the Use of Ocean-Based Once-Through CoolingCalifornia has a US EPA-approved program to issue individual or group permits for the regulation of Clean Water Act discharges. California also regulates certain discharges not regulated by the US EPA. In 2010, the California State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") issued a final policy, which established significant restrictions on the use of ocean water by existing once-through cooled power plants along the California coast. The final policy required an independent engineering study to be completed prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 regarding the feasibility of compliance by California's two coastal nuclear power plants. SCE received a suspension of the requirement to perform the study pending the submittal of additional information to the SWRCB regarding the continued use of ocean water at San Onofre during decommissioning. In November 2013, SCE submitted this additional information to the SWRCB and is awaiting a decision on its request to be exempted from the requirements of the policy. If the SWRCB grants the exemption, further compliance-related capital expenditures at San Onofre will likely not be required.Greenhouse Gas RegulationThere have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Any climate change regulation or other legal obligation that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions or that would impose additional costs or charges for the emission of GHGs could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels, as well as the cost of purchased power.Federal Legislative/Regulatory DevelopmentsIn 2010, the US EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, known as the "GHG tailoring rule." This regulation generally subjects newly constructed sources of GHG emissions and newly modified existing major sources to the PSD air permitting program beginning in January 2011 (and later, to the Title V permitting program under the CAA); however, the GHG tailoring rule significantly increases the emissions thresholds that apply before facilities are subjected to these programs. The emissions thresholds for CO2 equivalents in the final rule vary from 75,000 tons per year to 100,000 tons per year, depending on the date and whether the sources are new or modified. In September 2013, the US EPA announced proposed carbon dioxide emissions limits for new power plants. President Obama has directed the US EPA to develop greenhouse gas emissions performance standards for existing plants by June 2015. Regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the PSD program could affect efforts to modify SCE's facilities in the future, and could subject new capital projects to additional permitting or emissions control requirements that could delay such projects. Since 2010, the US EPA's Final Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule has required all sources within specified categories, including electric generation facilities, to monitor emissions, and to submit annual reports to the US EPA by March 31 of each year. SCE's 2013 GHG emissions from utility-owned generation were approximately 6.7 million metric tons. Regional Initiatives and State LegislationRegional initiatives and state legislation also require reductions of GHG emissions and it is not yet clear whether or to what extent any federal legislation would preempt them. If state and/or regional initiatives remain in effect after federal legislation is enacted, utilities and generators could be required to satisfy them in addition to the federal standards.11SCE's operations in California are subject to two laws governing GHG emissions. The first law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (also referred to as AB 32), establishes a comprehensive program to reduce GHG emissions. AB 32 required the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") to develop regulations, which became effective in 2012, that would reduce California's GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In December 2011, the CARB regulation was officially published establishing a California cap-and-trade program. In the California cap-and-trade program, all covered GHG emitters, including SCE, are subject to a “cap” on their emissions designed to encourage entities to reduce emissions from their operations. Covered entities must remit a compliance instrument for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent gas emitted and can do so buying state-issued emission allowances at auction or purchasing them in the secondary allowance market. GHG emitters can also meet up to 8% of their AB 32 cap-and-trade obligations by participating in verified offset programs, such as reforestation, that have recognized effects on reducing atmospheric GHGs. The first compliance period for the cap-and-trade program covers 2013-2014 GHG emissions. The most recent auction, held on November 19, 2013, cleared at $11.48/metric ton, $0.77 above the floor price of $10.71.CARB regulations implementing a cap-and-trade program and the cap-and-trade program itself, continue to be the subject of litigation. In 2012, environmental groups filed a case against CARB challenging the cap-and-trade program's offset provisions. SCE intervened as part of a broad business coalition to support the provisions on offset programs. The Superior Court upheld the offset provisions but the case is on appeal. The California Chamber of Commerce and a private company filed suits alleging that the auction itself violated AB 32 and the California Constitution. The Superior Court consolidated the two suits and ruled in CARB's favor in November 2013. Plaintiffs have announced their intent to appeal.The second law, SB 1368, required the CPUC and the CEC to adopt GHG emission performance standards that apply to California investor-owned and publicly owned utilities' long-term arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The standards that have been adopted prohibit these entities, including SCE, from entering into long-term financial commitments with generators that emit more than 1,100 pounds of CO2 per MWh, which is the performance of a combined-cycle gas turbine generator.In 2011, California enacted a law to require California retail sellers of electricity to procure 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute. The CPUC set procurement quantity requirements applicable to SCE that incrementally increase to 33% over several periods between January 2011 and December 2020. The requirement remains at 33% of retail sales for each year thereafter. In October 2013, AB 327 was enacted to permit the CPUC to require the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of 33%; but the CPUC has not yet changed this requirement. SCE's delivery of eligible renewable resources to customers was 20% of its total energy portfolio for 2012 and is estimated to be approximately 22% of its total energy portfolio for 2013. Litigation DevelopmentsLitigation alleging that GHGs have caused damages for which plaintiffs seek recovery may affect SCE, whether or not it is named as a defendant. The legal developments in this area have focused on whether lawsuits seeking recovery for such alleged damages present questions capable of judicial resolution or political questions that should be resolved by the legislative or executive branches.In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed public nuisance claims against five power companies related to GHG emissions. In the dismissal, the Supreme Court ruled that the CAA, and the US EPA actions it authorizes, displace federal common law nuisance claims that might arise from the emission of GHGs. The Supreme Court also affirmed that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing to bring the case, but did not determine whether the CAA also preempts state law claims that might arise from the same circumstances.Other suits alleging causes of action that include negligence, public and private nuisance, trespass, and violation of the public trust have been dismissed on threshold grounds, including justiciability and standing, by several courts. However, various groups of plaintiffs continue to explore and assert legal theories under which they seek to obtain recovery for past alleged harm, or have courts issue rulings that will control levels of current and future GHG emissions. Thus, the defendants in the dismissed actions, including SCE and other Edison International subsidiaries, together with other industrial companies associated with GHG emissions, may be required to defend such actions in both state and federal courts for the foreseeable future.12ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONALEdison International's liquidity depends on SCE's ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to Edison International.Edison International is a holding company and, as such, it has no operations of its own. Edison International's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of SCE and its ability to make upstream distributions. Prior to paying dividends to Edison International, SCE has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. In addition, CPUC holding company rules require that SCE's dividend policy be established by SCE's Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE's service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. SCE may also owe tax-allocation payments to Edison International under applicable tax-allocation agreements. Financial market and economic conditions may have an adverse effect on Edison International's liquidity. See "Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company" below for further discussion.The Settlement Agreement between Edison International, EME and certain of EME’s unsecured creditors may not be approved by the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise not be consummated, which could result in claims by EME against Edison International that may result in losses to Edison International. In December 2012, EME and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. EME submitted its Plan of Reorganization in December 2013, which included the sale of substantially all of EME’s assets to NRG Energy, Inc. Under the December Plan, EME would have retained certain assets and liabilities, including any claims against Edison International when it emerges from bankruptcy. EME had indicated that it was preparing a complaint containing claims similar to those alleged by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in a motion filed in the Bankruptcy Court in August 2013 against Edison International, SCE, certain other subsidiaries of Edison International, and present and former directors of Edison International, SCE and EME (the "EME Claims"). In February 2014, Edison International, EME and certain of EME’s creditors holding a majority of its outstanding senior unsecured notes (“Consenting Noteholders”) entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which EME amended its previously filed Plan of Reorganization to incorporate the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Under the Amended Plan of Reorganization, all existing EME claims against Edison International would be extinguished. The Amended Plan of Reorganization, including the Settlement Agreement, is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, which is expected to occur in March 2014, but is not certain. If the Amended Plan is not approved, this could result in EME or its creditors filing the EME Claims against Edison International, SCE, certain other subsidiaries of Edison International, and present and former directors of Edison International, SCE and EME. If such a complaint were to be filed, Edison International would vigorously contest such allegations. An unfavorable outcome of such claims by EME could result in losses to and adversely impact Edison International. For further information on EME's bankruptcy filing, see "Management Overview—EME Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing."Edison International's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region.Edison International does not have diversified sources of revenue or regulatory oversight. SCE comprises substantially all of Edison International’s business, and Edison International’s business is expected to remain concentrated in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Edison International's current business is concentrated almost entirely in southern California. As a result, Edison International's future performance may be affected by events and economic performance concentrated in southern California or by regional regulation or legislation.13RISKS RELATING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANYRegulatory RisksSCE is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory decisions and changes in applicable regulations or legislation.SCE operates in a highly regulated environment. SCE's business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. Among other things, the CPUC regulates SCE's retail rates and capital structure, and the FERC regulates SCE's wholesale rates. The NRC regulated the operations of San Onofre and regulates the decommissioning of San Onofre. The construction, planning, and project site identification of SCE's power plants and transmission lines in California are also subject to the jurisdiction of the California Energy Commission (for thermal power plants 50 MW or greater) and the CPUC.SCE must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders. Should SCE be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on SCE, SCE's business could be materially affected. The process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by concerted community opposition and such delay or defeat would have a material effect on SCE's business.This extensive governmental regulation creates significant risks and uncertainties for SCE's business. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to SCE, or its facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE's business or result in significant additional costs. In addition, regulations adopted via the public initiative process may apply to SCE, or its facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE's business or result in significant additional costs.SCE's financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates.SCE's ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover from its customers in a timely manner its costs, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and FERC. SCE's financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. SCE's capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. If SCE is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover material amounts of its costs (including an adequate return on capital) in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. For further information on SCE's rate requests, see "Management Overview—2015 General Rate Case," "Item 1. Business—SCE—Overview of Ratemaking Process—Retail Rates Structure" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources—SCE—Regulatory Proceedings—FERC Formula Rates" in the MD&A.SCE may not fully recover its investment in San Onofre from regulatory proceedings, SCE's supplier, insurance, or otherwise; could be subject to NRC actions, including the imposition of penalties; or could be ordered by the CPUC to make refunds to customers of prior revenues. In June 2013, SCE decided to permanently retire and decommission Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre. The CPUC is conducting an investigation proceeding that will consider the cost recovery for all San Onofre costs, including the cost of the steam generator replacement project, other sunk capital costs, substitute market power costs, nuclear fuel, operation and maintenance costs and seismic study costs. SCE cannot assure that the remaining cost of the steam generators, repair costs or the necessary substitute market power will be recoverable from its supplier, insurance, regulatory processes or otherwise or that the CPUC will not order refund of revenues previously collected. These amounts could be material and could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations. San Onofre remains subject to NRC oversight and SCE is aware of an NRC investigation into information SCE provided to the NRC regarding the steam generator failure; which could subject SCE to additional actions, including imposition of penalties. For more information, see "Management Overview—Permanent Retirement of San Onofre" in the MD&A.SCE's energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity.SCE obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants, and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. California law and CPUC decisions allow SCE to recover through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an 14approved procurement plan. Nonetheless, SCE's cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes to commodity prices. In addition, SCE is subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely CPUC decisions about the compliance with SCE's procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs. For more information, see "Management Overview—ERRA Balancing Account" in the MD&A.SCE may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect SCE's liquidity and results of operations, see "Market Risk Exposures" in the MD&A.Financing RisksAs a capital intensive company, SCE relies on access to the capital markets. If SCE were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations would be materially affected.SCE regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. SCE's needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. SCE's ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal, interest and preferred stock dividends, are dependent on numerous factors, including SCE's levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, its financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. SCE's failure to obtain additional capital from time to time would have a material effect on SCE's liquidity and operations.Competitive and Market RisksThe electricity industry is undergoing extensive changes, including increased competition, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.The entire electricity industry is undergoing extensive change, including technological advancements such as self-generation, energy storage and distributed generation that may change the nature of energy generation and delivery. Demand for electricity from utilities has been leveling, while growth in self-generation has been accelerating. At the same time, a growing amount of investment is needed to replace aging infrastructure, and without corresponding growth in demand or corresponding savings elsewhere, these investments are reflected in rate increases that have the effect of further leveling demand and encouraging self-generation. Self-generation itself may exacerbate these trends by reducing the pool of customers, subject to certain regulatory limits, from whom fixed costs are recovered, while potentially increasing costs of system modifications that may be needed to integrate the systemic effects of self-generation. Rate designs that disproportionately impose costs on some classes of customers also accelerate these trends. For example, customers in California that self-generate their own power do not currently pay most transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations. Other customer classes have had artificial caps placed upon their proportionate sharing in overall costs. The net result is to increase utility rates further for those customers who do not self-generate or are not subject to such caps, which encourages more self-generation and further rate increases. For more information, see "Item 1. Business—SCE—Overview of Ratemaking Process—Retail Rates Structure."In addition, the FERC has adopted changes that have opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. For more information, see "Item 1. Business—SCE—Competition."Another emerging trend in the electricity industry is the increasing public discussion regarding the possibility of future changes in the electric utility business model as a result of the technological advancements and competitive pressures discussed above as well as political and regulatory developments. In October 2013, the CPUC held an open hearing to receive views from various sources on whether the current California utility business model should be revised. It is possible that material revisions to the traditional utility business model could materially affect SCE's business model and its financial condition and results of operations. Operating RisksSCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its facilities.SCE's infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. In order to mitigate this risk, SCE is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment program. This substantial investment program elevates the operational risks and the need for superior execution in its activities. SCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its 15facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous. SCE's inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs, system limitations and degradation, and interruptions in necessary supplies.Weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations.Weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including storms, wildfires and earthquakes, can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to SCE's customers. These events can lead to lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repair costs. They can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if SCE encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers. These occurrences could materially affect SCE's business, financial condition and results of operations, and the inability to restore power to SCE's customers could also materially damage the business reputation of SCE and Edison International.The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to employees and the general public.Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through downed power lines or if equipment malfunctions. Injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject SCE to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. The CPUC has increased its focus on public safety issues with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. Such penalties and liabilities could be significant but are very difficult to predict. The range of possible penalties and liabilities includes amounts that could materially affect SCE's liquidity and results of operations.SCE's systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical and cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.Regulators, such as the NERC, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, have noted that the U.S. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures have potential vulnerabilities to cyber and other attacks and disruptions and that such threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. SCE's operations require the continuous operation of critical information technology systems and network infrastructure. Although SCE actively monitors developments in this area and is involved in various industry groups and government initiatives, no security measures can completely shield such systems and infrastructure from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. If SCE's information technology systems security measures were to be breached or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, SCE could be unable to fulfill critical business functions and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations and materially damage the business reputation of Edison International and SCE. See "Item 1. Business—Regulation—NERC" for further discussion.There are inherent risks associated with owning and decommissioning nuclear power generating facilities, including, among other things, potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and the danger of storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials.The cost of decommissioning Unit 2 and Unit 3 of San Onofre could prove more extensive than is currently estimated. These costs could exceed estimates or may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise. For more information, see "Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company—Regulatory Risks" above.Existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect SCE fully against losses from a nuclear incident. Federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately $13.6 billion. SCE and other owners of the San Onofre and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $375 million per site. If nuclear incident liability claims were to exceed $375 million, the remaining amount would be made up from contributions of approximately $12.2 billion made by all of the nuclear facility owners in the U.S., up to an aggregate total of $13.6 billion. There is no assurance that the CPUC would allow SCE to recover the required contribution made in the case of one or more nuclear incident claims that exceeded $375 million. If this public liability limit of $13.6 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. There can be no assurance of SCE's ability to recover uninsured costs in the event 16the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. For more information on nuclear insurance risk, see "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies—Nuclear Insurance."SCE's insurance coverage for wildfires arising from its ordinary operations may not be sufficient.Edison International has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from SCE's ordinary operations. In addition, the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect Edison International's and SCE's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to Edison International. For more information on wildfire insurance risk, see "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies—Wildfire Insurance."Environmental RisksSCE is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may involve significant and increasing costs and materially affect SCE.SCE is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations and permitting requirements that involve significant and increasing costs and substantial uncertainty. SCE devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation projects, and emission allowances to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulatory requirements. However, the current trend is toward more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement greenhouse gas controls could materially affect operations of power plants, which could in turn impact electricity markets and SCE's purchased power costs. SCE may also be exposed to risks arising from past, current or future contamination at its former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in its operations. Other environmental laws, particularly with respect to air emissions, disposal of ash, wastewater discharge and cooling water systems, are also generally becoming more stringent.
