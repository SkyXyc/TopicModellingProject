    FedEx
    Freight Segment


 



    FedEx
    Freight Corporation


 


    FedEx Freight Corporation provides a full range of LTL freight
    services through its FedEx Freight business (regional
    next-day and
    second-day
    and interregional LTL freight services), its FedEx National LTL
    business (long-haul LTL freight services) and its FedEx Freight
    Canada business, and is known for its exceptional service,
    reliability and on-time performance. Through a comprehensive
    network of service centers and advanced information systems,
    FedEx Freight provides service to virtually all U.S. ZIP
    Codes (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading
    transit times. FedEx Freight’s regional and interregional
    LTL freight services are supported by a no-fee money-back
    guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight
    serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the
    Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased
    transportation. FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an
    indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to weekly adjustment
    based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway
    average price for a gallon of diesel fuel.


 


    We are focused on expanding the FedEx Freight
    network — opening new service centers and increasing
    capacity at a number of key locations — to better meet
    customer demand. For example, in 2007, FedEx Freight opened
    seven new service centers and expanded eight others. In 2007,
    FedEx Freight Corporation also added a long-haul LTL freight
    business and Canadian operations by acquiring the U.S. and
    Canadian LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and
    certain affiliates, now known as FedEx National LTL and FedEx
    Freight Canada. See “Strategy.”


 


    FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and
    provides tailored shipping solutions to help shippers meet tight
    deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can
    match customers’
    time-critical

    needs with reduced transit times,
    after-hours
    pickup or delivery, or
    same-day
    delivery. FedEx Freight’s fully integrated Web site and
    other
    e-tools,
    including a bill of lading generator and
    e-mail
    delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring
    customers closer to their own account information. The FedEx
    Freight Advance Notice service feature uses the company’s
    innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx
    Freight customers via the Internet or fax when a shipment may be
    delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers
    with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight
    shipments.


 


    FedEx Freight Corporation has leveraged its relationships with
    other FedEx operating companies to meet the increasingly global
    needs of customers. For example, the FedEx Freight Corporation
    sales force sells FedEx Express freight services, and FedEx
    Services sales representatives share LTL leads with their
    counterparts at FedEx Freight Corporation. The sales effort is
    one phase of a broad initiative aimed at leveraging FedEx’s
    competitive advantage in U.S. domestic freight services.


 


    FedEx Freight Corporation subsidiary Caribbean Transportation
    Services, Inc. (“CTS”) is the leading provider of
    airfreight forwarding services between the United States and
    Puerto Rico, specializing in arranging the shipment of
    heavyweight and oversized cargo. CTS, which also serves the
    Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and the Caribbean Islands,
    provides several delivery options for door-to-door or
    airport-to-airport airfreight forwarder services, principally to
    the medical, pharmaceutical and technology sectors.


 


    As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Freight Corporation had
    approximately 37,000 employees operating approximately
    59,000 vehicles and trailers from a network of approximately 470
    service centers. Douglas G. Duncan is the President and Chief
    Executive Officer of FedEx Freight Corporation, which is based
    in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary
    multiregional LTL freight competitors are Con-Way Freight, a
    subsidiary of Con-way Inc., YRC Regional Transportation (which
    comprises the USF regional companies), a division of YRC
    Worldwide Inc., and UPS Freight. FedEx National LTL’s
    primary long-haul LTL freight competitors are YRC National
    Transportation (which comprises Yellow Transportation and
    Roadway), a division of YRC Worldwide Inc., and ABF Freight
    System, Inc.


 



    FedEx
    Custom Critical


 


    FedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited,
    time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the United
    States, Canada and Mexico. Among its divisions are Surface
    Expedite, for exclusive-use and FedEx Freight network-based
    transport of critical shipments and expedited LTL shipments; Air
    Expedite, which offers an array of air solutions to meet
    customers’ critical delivery times; and White Glove
    Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling,
    temperature control or specialized security. Service is
    available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including
    weekends and holidays at no extra cost. FedEx Custom Critical
    continuously monitors shipments through an integrated
    proprietary shipment-control system, including two-way satellite
    communications on exclusive-use shipments. Through the Shipping
    Toolkit, located at customcritical.fedex.com, customers
    can quote, ship, track and map shipments; view and print out
    copies of a shipment’s bill of lading, proof of delivery
    and invoice; and manage their online accounts. FedEx Custom
    Critical utilizes approximately 1,400 vehicles, operated by
    owner-operators and their drivers, which are dispatched out of
    approximately 150 geographically-based staging areas. FedEx
    Custom Critical also provides door-to-door vehicle transport
    through its Passport Auto Transport subsidiary.


 



    FedEx
    Kinko’s Segment


 


    FedEx Kinko’s is a leader in the document and business
    services market, offering a wide array of innovative solutions,
    including retail access to the full range of FedEx day-definite
    ground shipping and
    time-definite
    global express shipping services. We are focused on expanding
    the FedEx Kinko’s retail network, which will substantially
    increase customer access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground
    services and provide growth opportunities in
    e-commerce
    and other business services. FedEx Kinko’s opened 226 new
    centers in 2007 and plans to open approximately 300 new centers
    in 2008. The new lower-cost centers, which are approximately
    one-third the size of a traditional center, are based on a new
    format designed to enhance customer service and convenience. As
    an example, the new centers include enhanced
    pack-and-ship
    stations and offer twice as many office products as traditional
    centers.

    During 2007, we launched FedEx Kinko’s Direct Mail

    medium-sized businesses easily communicate to target audiences,
    and FedEx Kinko’s Print Online, a new Web-based,
    print-on-demand

    Direct Mail Services include design, production, professional
    finishing, address cleansing and verification and mail

    select from extensive printing and finishing options, track
    order status, reuse saved print jobs and review order history.
    In June 2007, we extended the application to users of the
    popular Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat software applications,
    both of which will now feature a FedEx Kinko’s Print Online
    connection for sending documents directly to a FedEx
    Kinko’s Office and Print Center for printing.


 


    FedEx Kinko’s offers a full range of
    black-and-white,
    color and custom printing, copying and binding services and an
    increasingly broad array of other business services, including,
    among others, high-speed Internet access and computer rental,
    videoconferencing, signs and graphics production services and
    direct mail services. FedEx Kinko’s has capitalized on the
    trend toward
    e-business,
    offering many Web-based services, including Print Online
    (described above); File, Print FedEx Kinko’s, a free
    software tool that works over the Web to connect Microsoft
    Windows desktop users to copying and printing services at FedEx
    Kinko’s Office and Print Centers; and DocStore, an online
    ordering solution for digital
    print-on-demand.
    FedEx Kinko’s also offers retail products, such as
    specialty papers, greeting cards, printer cartridges, stationery
    and office supplies.

    Kinko’s provides a complete
    “pack-and-ship”
    solution.

    trade. More than 150 countries, including European Union
    members, the United States and Japan, recognize ISO standards.

    Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee.
    As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Services had approximately
    15,000 employees.


 



    Technology


 


    FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder
    Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information
    about a package is as important as the delivery of the package
    itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology
    strategy.


 


    Our technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer
    satisfaction. We strive to build technology solutions that will
    solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity,
    convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our
    strategy is our award-winning Web site, together with our
    customer integrated solutions.


 


    The fedex.com Web site was launched over ten years ago,
    and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked
    billions of packages at fedex.com. The fedex.com
    Web site is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and
    customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our customers
    ship packages, determine international documentation
    requirements, track package status, pay invoices and access
    FedEx Kinko’s office and printing services. Our FedEx
    Insight application provides customers with visibility and
    package status of their inbound and outbound express, ground and
    freight shipments. Our FedEx Global Trade Manager resource
    enables customers to more easily navigate the complexities of
    international commerce by helping them identify the documents
    they need in order to ship to and from specific countries. FedEx
    Global Trade Manager also offers a currency converter, profiles
    of regulatory information by country, a customs regulation guide
    and, through its “Estimate Duties and Taxes” features,
    customers can estimate applicable governmental charges, duties
    and fees. FedEx Billing Online provides customers real-time
    access to their accounts, invoices and paid shipment details.


 


    We have extended the reach of the fedex.com Web site to
    be accessible from most wireless devices, making it faster and
    easier for U.S. and Canadian customers to access real-time
    package status tracking information, rates and drop-off location
    data for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments. Our wireless
    service is available through Web-enabled devices, such as mobile
    telephones, personal digital assistants and Research In Motion
    (RIM) devices (such as the BlackBerry). FedEx also uses wireless
    data collection devices to scan bar codes on shipments. Our data
    collection device, the FedEx PowerPad, uses Bluetooth wireless
    technology to give our couriers wireless access to the FedEx
    network, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package
    information available to our customers.


 


    We design our
    e-commerce
    tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our
    customers’ applications, as well as into third-party
    software being developed by leading

    options to help our customers manage their shipping and
    associated processes.

    advanced electronic data interchanges to speed communications

    Trademarks


 


    The “FedEx” trademark, service mark and trade name is
    essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx
    Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Kinko’s, FedEx Services, FedEx
    Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information
    Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx
    SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are
    trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express
    Corporation for which registrations, or applications for
    registration, are on file. We have authorized, through licensing
    arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service
    marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service
    Participants to support our business. In addition, we license
    the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade
    names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing
    brand awareness.


 



    Regulation


 


    Air.  Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
    as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation
    (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration
    (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx
    Express.


 


    The FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to
    operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft
    standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as
    personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time
    affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in
    the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier
    certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the
    federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited
    duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express
    maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational
    requirements of the regulations.



    
    17



Table of Contents




    The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects
    of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to
    aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters,
    including the transfer of route authority between carriers.
    FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT,
    authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and
    international air transportation of property and mail on a
    worldwide basis. FedEx Express’s international authority
    permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its
    U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world.
    The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is
    authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory
    treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a
    United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the
    DOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement
    between the United States and the foreign government. The
    carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign
    government to provide specific flights and services. The
    regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time
    to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air
    network in the most efficient manner.


 


    Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as
    amended, the Transportation Security Administration
    (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland
    Security, has responsibility for aviation security. In May 2006,
    the TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security
    requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo
    aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA issued a revised model
    all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new
    rules. Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we have
    filed comments with the TSA requesting clarification regarding
    several provisions in the revised model program. Until the
    requirements for our security program under the new rules are
    finalized, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules
    will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is
    reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future
    security requirements for air cargo carriers could impose
    material costs on us.


 


    FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
    (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the
    U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use
    certain of FedEx Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the
    event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx
    Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft
    requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates
    established each year in the normal course of awarding
    contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx
    Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter
    business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other
    carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for
    charter flights.


 


    Ground.  The ground transportation performed by
    FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services.
    The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration
    Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to
    regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo
    air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only
    exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express
    is registered in those states that require registration.


 


    The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National
    LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are
    currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier
    Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority
    over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by
    the states of rates and service in intrastate freight
    transportation.


 


    Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject
    to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate
    operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain
    subject to both federal and state regulations.


 


    Communication.  Because of the extensive use of
    radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and
    ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to
    the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended.
    Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates
    and licenses FedEx Express’s activities pertaining to
    satellite communications.


 


    Environmental.  Pursuant to the Federal
    Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to
    establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx
    Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current
    noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. FedEx
    Express’s aircraft are also subject to, and are in
    compliance with, the regulations governing engine emissions. In
    addition to federal



    
    18



Table of Contents




    regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have
    local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type
    of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a
    restrictive effect on FedEx Express’s aircraft operations
    in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a
    material effect on any of FedEx Express’s significant
    markets. Congress’s passage of the Airport Noise and
    Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which
    enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better
    respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express’s
    international operations are also subject to noise regulations
    in certain of the countries in which it operates.


 


    We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws
    and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency
    planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste
    oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx
    Kinko’s copy machines and photo film developing operations.
    Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing
    with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling,
    vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of effluents
    from our properties and equipment. We have environmental
    management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.


 


    Customs.  Our activities, including customs
    brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by
    the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within
    the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and
    security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission
    (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding).
    Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the
    regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.
