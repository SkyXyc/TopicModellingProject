. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information in this 2013 Annual Report, any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity, which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline.This report contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and performance. We generally identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “project,” “plan,” “predict,” “believe,” “seek,” “continue,” “outlook,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events. Forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or events. In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to our indebtedness, our ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, our ability to satisfy the covenants contained in our indebtedness, the redemption of the notes, expectations regarding indebtedness, future use of cash and dividend payments, future actions, business plans or prospects, prospective products, product approvals or products under development, R&D costs, timing and likelihood of success, future operating or financial performance, future results of current and anticipated products and services, strategies, sales efforts, expenses, production efficiencies, production margins, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, growth in emerging markets, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, our agreements with Pfizer, government regulation and financial results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are potentially inaccurate assumptions. However, there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if management's underlying beliefs and assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. You should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Risks related to our business and industryRestrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent.The issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterials resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. Antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our anti-infectives and medicated feed additives portfolios. In some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable). These restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. Our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.In December 2013, the FDA announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the United States over a three year period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals (medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health). The guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment, control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease, all under the supervision of a veterinarian. Our total revenue attributable to medicated feed additives was approximately $446 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The FDA indicated that they took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans. Zoetis supports the FDA's efforts to voluntarily phase-out growth promotion indications for medically important antibiotics in food producing animals and will comply with procedures outlined in the December 2013 FDA guidance.  We cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products.Our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. If the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products, there may be a decline in the production of such food products and, in turn, demand for our products. For example, livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights, nutrition and health-related or other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including our company. Adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.12 |Table of ContentsIncreased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food-producing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products.Companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. If livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations, they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, adverse regulations related, directly or indirectly, to the use of one or more of our products may injure livestock producers' market position. More stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Also, many food-producing companies, including livestock producers, benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our products.An outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products.Sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (otherwise known as BSE or mad cow disease) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (otherwise known as PEDv), which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. In addition, outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes. For example, beginning in 2013 an outbreak of PEDv has had serious impacts on swine herds in the United States, spreading to at least 27 swine-producing states and affecting up to 30% of the sows in the United States. The continued spread of PEDv in the United States and neighboring countries could impact the size of swine herds and the demand for our swine products in these markets. In addition, in April 2012, the USDA announced that it had identified a case of BSE in California. This announcement caused certain countries to implement additional inspections of, or suspend the importation of, U.S. beef. Additionally, in December 2012, the World Animal Health Organization announced that a case of BSE had been identified in Brazil. This announcement similarly caused certain countries to suspend the importation of Brazilian beef. While the restrictions that were implemented as a result of these cases of BSE have not significantly affected demand for our products, the discovery of additional cases of BSE may result in additional restrictions related to, or reduced demand for, animal protein, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.Consolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products.Veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, livestock producers, particularly swine and poultry producers, have seen recent consolidation in their industries. If these trends towards consolidation continue, these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources.The animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.In addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care. Veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather. Furthermore, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. Their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products.For example, the widespread drought that impacted the United States in 2011, 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years, impacting both the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pasture and resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013. A decrease in harvested corn may result in higher corn prices, which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle, pork and poultry. Higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products. Reduced availability of grazing pasture may also force cattle producers to cull their herds. Fewer heads of cattle would result in reduced demand for our products. A prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions.Macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers. For example, the economic downturns experienced in many markets across the globe have had an impact on certain of our customers and, as a result, on our operating results in those affected markets. If one or more of our large customers, including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet.13 |Table of ContentsOur business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income.Feed, fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease. Either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers, potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered. Our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products, including by switching to lower-cost alternatives to our products. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lower-cost alternatives to our products. These shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products, especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership.Changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.In most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. Companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as Internet-based retailers, “big-box” retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years. Companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on Internet-based animal health information. Because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.Legislation has also been proposed in the United States, and may be proposed in the United States or abroad in the future, that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the American Veterinary Medical Association has long-standing policies in place to encourage this practice.Over time, these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on Internet-based retailers, “big-box” retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products. We may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The animal health industry is highly competitive.The animal health industry is highly competitive. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses. These competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling their products, initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities. In addition to competition from established market participants, new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete.To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, safety and efficacy concerns, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale, the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us.Generic products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.We face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. We depend on patents and data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. Our patent protection for these products extends for varying periods in accordance with the dates of filing or grant and the legal life of patents in countries in which patents are granted. The protection afforded by our patents, which varies from country to country, is limited by the following in the applicable country: the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies. As a result, we may face competition from lower-priced generic alternatives to many of our products. Generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before our patent rights expire, and their pricing, and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. In addition, private label products may compete with our products. If animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We estimate that approximately 80% of our revenue in 2013 was derived from products that are either unpatented (i.e., never patented or off-patent) or covered by our patents that, while providing a competitive advantage, may not provide market exclusivity. Over the next several years, several of our products' patents will expire. For example, our compound patent on selamectin, the active ingredient in Revolution and Stronghold, expired in several countries in January 2014, which could lead to the launch of generic counterparts, if generic manufacturers are able to successfully design-around our formulation and process patents. 14 |Table of ContentsWe may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form and manage alliances or divest businesses.We may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy. We may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits. Even if we are successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. We may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies. We also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. We may be subject to litigation in connection with, or as a result of, acquisitions, dispositions, licenses or other alliances, including claims from terminated employees, customers or third parties, and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business, disposition, license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient. These effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements.We are pursuing, and will continue to pursue, strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including, but not limited to, increasing sales in emerging markets, operational revenue growth through new product development and value-added product lifecycle development; improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs; using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt; and expanding our complementary products and services. In addition to base revenue growth, we also have historically grown our business through Pfizer's acquisitions of large pharmaceutical companies that had animal health businesses, including the Fort Dodge Animal Health (FDAH) business of Wyeth and the Alpharma Animal Health business of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. However, as a result of the Separation, we are no longer able to benefit from Pfizer's acquisition activity. We also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. It could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all. We may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies, including those acquired and those developed internally. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.Our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages.Some of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions, including the United States. As a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites. These risks may be increased by the Separation because we are no longer able to benefit from Pfizer's prior relationships and negotiations relating to such agreements. We could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income. In addition, labor problems at our suppliers or CMOs could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations.We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. Our executive officers are not currently, and are not expected to be, subject to non-compete provisions. In addition, we have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.We may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of December 31, 2013, we had goodwill of $982 million and identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, of $803 million. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights, brands, trademarks, license agreements, patents and in-process R&D.Determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management's valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income and write-downs recorded in our consolidated and combined balance sheets could vary if management's conclusions change. Any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.15 |Table of ContentsOur historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.Our historical combined financial data for the periods prior to the IPO included in this 2013 Annual Report does not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. This is primarily the result of the following factors: •our historical combined financial data does not reflect the Separation;•our historical combined financial data reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Pfizer, such as expenses for business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, public affairs and procurement, as well as certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by manufacturing sites that are shared with other Pfizer business units that may be higher or lower than the comparable expenses we would have actually incurred, or will incur, as an independent company;•our cost of debt and our capital structure will be different from that reflected in our historical combined financial statements;•significant increases may occur in our cost structure as a result of our being an independent public company, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act); and•loss of economies of scale as a result of our no longer being a part of Pfizer.Our financial condition and future results of operations will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this 2013 Annual Report for the periods prior to the IPO. As a result of the Separation, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.As an independent public company, we are required to expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not previously apply to us, and failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial data.As an independent public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations of the NYSE. Such requirements will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and could be burdensome on our personnel, systems and resources. We are devoting significant resources to address these public company-associated requirements, including compliance programs and investor relations, as well as our financial reporting obligations. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time-consuming and costly.In particular, as a public company, our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 5 beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2014. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, or if our registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.Risks related to research and developmentOur R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle developments.Our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.We may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. In addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations. The animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets. Furthermore, the timing and cost of our R&D may increase, and our R&D may become less predictable. For example, changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more time-consuming and/or costly to research, develop and register products.Products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research. In addition to the R&D collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, we expect to enter into other collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business. Such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement. If we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful, and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators, which we may not be able to control. If we are unable to access human health-generated molecules and compounds to conduct R&D on cost-effective terms, our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited.16 |Table of ContentsAdvances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products.The market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred disease-resistant animals. In addition, technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our R&D relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional regulations.As an animal health medicines and vaccines business, the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products. Animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our R&D, and by extension our operating results and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation.Risks related to manufacturingManufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.In order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. We have a global manufacturing network consisting of 28 manufacturing sites located in 11 countries. In addition, 13 Pfizer sites located in 12 countries manufacture certain of our products for us. Included in these 13 Pfizer sites is our facility in Guarulhos, Brazil, where Pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time. These 13 Pfizer sites consist of sites operated by Pfizer that, immediately prior to the Separation, predominantly manufactured human health products. We also employ a network of approximately 200 CMOs. Many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites.Minor deviations in our manufacturing processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including:•the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines;•construction delays;•equipment malfunctions;•shortages of materials;•labor problems;•natural disasters;•power outages;•terrorist activities;•changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and•the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near our production sites.These interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may adversely affect our operating results. For example, our manufacturing site in Medolla, Italy was damaged in an earthquake in May 2012, which resulted in production interruptions at that site.Our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.We rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs.The materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other factors. In addition, labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor, governmental regulations, economic climate and other factors. Increases in the demand for, availability or the price of, materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products. We may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.17 |Table of ContentsIn addition, certain third-party suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products. We may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our third-party suppliers cease or interrupt operations, fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us.Risks related to legal matters and regulationWe may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters.Our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters. These matters include, among other things, allegations of violation of United States and foreign competition laws, labor laws, consumer protection laws, and environmental laws and regulations, as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. In addition, changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject, or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our exposure to liability. For example, in the United States, attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of, or injury to, a companion animal. If such attempts were successful, our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially.Litigation matters, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management's attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters. An adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages. Any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.Our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species. There may be increased risk of product liability if veterinarians, livestock producers, pet owners or others attempt to use our products off-label, including the use of our products in species (including humans) for which they have not been approved. For example, Ketamine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our Ketaset product (a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats), is commonly abused by humans as a hallucinogen. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for off-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety, quality, or efficacy concerns, which may harm our reputation.Unanticipated safety, quality, or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims. For example, as a result of safety concerns related to our product, PregSure BVD, in 2010, we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the EU and, in 2011, we suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in New Zealand. Also, in May 2013, we were advised that the European Commission started a procedure regarding the EU marketing authorization for Suvaxyn PCV, a vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 in swine. The initiation of the procedure followed a recall of two batches of Suvaxyn PCV as a result of higher than expected adverse reactions, reported mainly in Spain. In June 2013, we completed a root cause investigation of the higher than expected adverse reactions in these two batches, and subsequently submitted to the EMA a proposed variation to describe specific adjustments to the manufacturing process to help minimize the risk of future reactive batches. In October 2013, the EMA’s Committee on Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use adopted a positive opinion as to the proposed variation and concurrently adopted an opinion concluding that no action was required at this time with regard to the EU marketing authorization for Suvaxyn PCV. Both opinions were transmitted to the European Commission according to the applicable procedure and the Commission officially advised us in January 2014 that it had adopted those positive opinions and concluded the procedure begun in May 2013 by maintaining the marketing authorization for Suvaxyn PCV in effect.Regulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our operating results.In addition, since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by our customers, veterinarians and end-users, any concerns as to the safety, qualify or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation. These concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.Our business is subject to substantial regulation.We will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products. Even after a product reaches market, it may be subject to re-review and may lose its approvals. In connection with the Separation, we will likely change the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and, because of these changes, may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals. Our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained, if ever.In addition, we cannot predict the nature of future laws or regulations, nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated, or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations, or of disparate federal, state, local and foreign regulatory schemes. Changes to such laws or regulations may include, 18 |Table of Contentsamong other things, changes to taxation requirements, such as tax-rate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the United States of income earned outside the United States.Changes in applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For example, regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies. Absent a clear understanding of these anomalies, regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter. Additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.Given the nature of our business, we have incurred, are currently incurring and may in the future incur, liabilities under CERCLA or under other federal, state, local and foreign environmental cleanup laws, with respect to our current or former sites, adjacent or nearby third-party sites, or offsite disposal locations. See Item 1. Business—Environmental, Health and Safety. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment. Such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products.Our failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Risks related to our international operationsA significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.Our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:•volatility in the international financial markets;•compliance with governmental controls;•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;•compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;•compliance with foreign labor laws;•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements;•changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers;•political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armed conflicts;•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by OFAC;•changes in tax laws and tariffs;•costs and difficulties in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations; and•longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability.19 |Table of ContentsIn addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. In addition, variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation of our products between jurisdictions. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.Foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In 2013, we generated approximately 54% of our revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.We also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While we currently have no need, and do not intend, to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should we need to do so to fund our operations, we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or unable to do so without incurring substantial costs. We currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China and Venezuela, and, if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For example, on February 13, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 Venezuelan bolivar per U.S. dollar. We incurred a foreign currency loss immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets and we will experience ongoing impacts to earnings as our revenue and expenses will be translated at lower rates. We cannot predict whether there will be further devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.We may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets.We have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets, including by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets. Failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local, regional or global economic, political or social instability or crisis. For example, our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters. Furthermore, we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries. In addition, certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially, which may impact our financial performance. For example, in the past, our revenue in certain emerging markets in Latin America have been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations. For all these and other reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks.Risks related to intellectual propertyThe actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.A third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of the third-party's patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to:•pay monetary damages;•obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or•stop activities, including any commercial activities, relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales in the future.The costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, even if we successfully defend such claims. The intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.20 |Table of ContentsIf our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts.Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret, data protection, and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, or at all. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. For example, some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself, and its first use, and thus further methods of use for the same compound, may not be patentable. We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country's practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.In addition, patent law reform in the United States and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights, or make such enforcement financially unattractive. For instance, in September 2011, the United States enacted the America Invents Act, which will permit enhanced third-party actions for challenging patents and will implement a first-to-invent system. In April 2012, Australia enacted the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Act, which provides higher standards for obtaining patents. In September 2013, the Brazilian Patent Office challenged the validity and term of the so-called “mailbox patents” of pharmaceutical and veterinary companies which were filed in the interim period before Brazil fully implemented the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right (TRIPS) Agreement's patentability standards. The action of the Brazilian Patent Office potentially could shorten the duration or invalidate some of our patents. We have filed an appeal, but the decision will not be known for several years. These reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions.Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Likewise, in the United States and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.Many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information, including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.The misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, may occur even when we take steps to prevent it. We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition. In the future, we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons, including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties, or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so; either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Risks related to information technologyWe may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites.In many markets around the world, such as the United States and Brazil, we provide online ordering sites to customers, often relying on third parties to host and support the application. The operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Risks associated with our online business include: disruptions in telephone service or power outages; failures of the computer systems that operate our website, including inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems; reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers; rapid technology changes; credit card fraud; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; power and network outages; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; liability 21 |Table of Contentsfor online content; and consumer privacy concerns. Problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation.We depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.We rely on various information systems to manage our operations, and we increasingly depend on third parties and applications on virtualized (cloud) infrastructure to operate and support our information technology systems. These third parties include large established vendors, as well as many small, privately owned companies. Failure by these providers to adequately service our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In connection with the IPO and the Separation, we have substantially changed a number of our business processes, including our financial reporting and supply chain processes. In order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with Pfizer, we have made significant configuration and data changes within some of our information technology systems. If our information technology and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions, or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes, our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and our operations may be adversely affected and, as a result, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.In addition, over the next few years, we expect to implement new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning system to better integrate our manufacturing, financial, commercial and business operations. Transitioning to new systems, integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions (including from circumstances beyond our control) affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, unreliable, corrupted, insufficient or inaccessible. Any of these potential issues, individually or in aggregation, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Even if we are able to implement these systems successfully, all technology systems, despite implementation of security measures, are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached, this could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.We may be unable to adequately protect our customers' privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws.The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security, storage, use, processing, disclosure and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any actual or perceived significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, cyber-attack or corruption of customer, employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits. Despite our considerable efforts and technology to secure our computer network, security could be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur. Our systems and procedures meet the payment card industry (PCI) data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess compliance. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards. In addition, PCI is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in PCI's fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation. Such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with PCI security standards, as well as significant unanticipated expenses. Such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Risks related to our indebtedness We have substantial indebtedness. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $3.6 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding. In addition, we have entered into an agreement for a five-year revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion. While we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program, we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future. We may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including: •making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements, including dividends; •increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; •exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may in the future be at variable rates of interest; •limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry; •placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors; •impacting our effective tax rate; and 22 |Table of Contents•increasing our cost of borrowing. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. For example, our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur liens, merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets, transact with subsidiaries and incur priority indebtedness. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due. In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock. We may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes.Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Pfizer-owned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to Pfizer prior to the completion of the IPO. As a result of these and other factors, we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer.Our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes.The credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies, if, in such rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs.Risks related to our relationship with PfizerWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation and Exchange Offer.We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation and Exchange Offer, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These expected benefits include the following:•improving strategic and operational flexibility, increasing management focus and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility to implement our strategic plan and to respond more effectively to different customer needs and the changing economic environment;•allowing us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, without competing for capital with Pfizer's other businesses;•creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock; and23 |Table of Contents•facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives of our business.We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Separation and Exchange Offer for a variety of reasons, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.As a result of the Separation, we have lost Pfizer's brand, reputation, capital base and other resources.Prior to the IPO, as a business unit of Pfizer, we generally used the name “Pfizer Animal Health,” and we believe the association with Pfizer and Pfizer's globally recognized brand and perceived high-quality products contributed to our ability to build relationships with our customers. Our loss of the use of the “Pfizer” name could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could result in reduced sales of our products, and could impact our ability to attract and retain colleagues, which could result in extended vacancies in key or critical positions.The loss of Pfizer's scale, capital base and financial strength may also prompt suppliers to reprice, modify or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, our separation from Pfizer may cause some of our existing agreements and licenses to be terminated. Pfizer may compete with us.Pfizer is not restricted from competing with us in the animal health business, including as a result of acquiring a company that operates an animal health business. Due to the significant resources of Pfizer, including financial resources, name recognition and know-how resulting from the previous management of our business, Pfizer could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to engage in the type of business we conduct, which may cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.Certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with Pfizer.Certain of our directors are employed by Pfizer or may own Pfizer common stock, options to purchase Pfizer common stock or other Pfizer equity awards. Certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such director's total assets. These directors' positions at Pfizer and the ownership of any Pfizer equity or equity awards may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Pfizer than for us.Pfizer and its directors and officers have limited liability to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty.Our certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, Pfizer will have no obligation to refrain from: •engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do;•doing business with any of our clients or consumers; or•employing or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees.Under our certificate of incorporation, neither Pfizer nor any officer or director of Pfizer, except as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities.To preserve the tax-free treatment to Pfizer and/or its stockholders of the Exchange Offer and certain related transactions, we may not be able to engage in certain transactions.To preserve the tax-free treatment to Pfizer and/or its stockholders of the Exchange Offer and certain related transactions, under the tax matters agreement, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including taking certain actions with respect to our 3.250% Senior Notes due 2023 and using our common stock to make acquisitions in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Relationship with Pfizer—Tax matters agreement.We may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of our R&D agreement with Pfizer.Prior to the Separation, as a business unit of Pfizer, we had the ability to leverage Pfizer's proprietary compound library and database to identify, research and develop compounds suitable as new product candidates for the animal health field. As part of the Separation, we entered into an R&D collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, which is referred to as the “R&D agreement.” Pursuant to the R&D agreement, subject to certain restrictions, we have continued access to Pfizer's compound library and database for a period of seven years from the date of the IPO and have, subject to Pfizer's approval, the possibility to exclusively license compounds from Pfizer that we develop under the R&D agreement.While the R&D agreement is intended to supplement our post-Separation R&D capabilities, certain terms of the R&D agreement may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit, including:•Pfizer will retain ownership of, and license to us, the intellectual property that we develop under the R&D agreement. In many circumstances, the intellectual property we license from Pfizer will be non-exclusive as to Pfizer and third parties.•We are not assured access to Pfizer's newest programs.•Pfizer can prevent us from progressing pre-development compounds and, under certain circumstances, Pfizer may terminate our rights to a development stage compound by paying us the fair market value for such compound.24 |Table of Contents•The R&D agreement may be terminated before the expiration of the seven year term in certain circumstances, including if we acquire an interest in, or assets of, a human pharmaceutical business, enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or undergo, a change of control or if Pfizer acquires, or is acquired by, an animal health business.Each of the foregoing terms and Pfizer's other rights under the R&D agreement and related licenses (if any), could limit our ability to realize the expected benefits of the R&D agreement. If we fail to achieve the expected benefits of the R&D agreement, it may be more difficult, time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products.For a summary description of the terms of the R&D collaboration and license agreement, see Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence— Relationship with Pfizer—Research and development collaboration and license agreement.Pfizer's rights as licensor under the patent and know-how license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.Under the patent and know-how license agreement (Pfizer as licensor) (the Patent and Know-How License Agreement), Pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and Pfizer exercises its right to terminate it, our ability to continue to research, develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited. In addition, in circumstances where Pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs, our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted and/or, in limited instances, subject to Pfizer's right to terminate such license at will. These limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult, time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products, or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors. For a summary description of the terms of the patent and know-how license (Pfizer as licensor), see Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Relationship with Pfizer—Intellectual property license agreements.We are dependent on Pfizer to prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.Under the Patent and Know-How License Agreement, Pfizer is responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents that Pfizer licenses to us. In the animal health field, Pfizer has the first right, and in some cases the sole right, to enforce such licensed patents, and in the human health field, subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents. If Pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement, we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.We have incurred and will continue to incur significant charges in connection with the Separation and incremental costs as an independent public company.We will need to replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access after the Separation. We may also need to make investments or hire additional employees to operate without the same access to Pfizer's existing operational and administrative infrastructure. These initiatives may be costly to implement. Due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts, the amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate, and the timing of the incurrence of these costs is subject to change.Prior to the Separation, Pfizer performed or supported many important corporate functions for our company. Our combined financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis. Following the Separation, many of these services will be governed by our transitional services agreement with Pfizer. Under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these Pfizer services for a fixed term established on a service-by-service basis. However, we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to Pfizer. Partial reduction in the provision of any service requires Pfizer's consent. In addition, either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party, upon prior written notice, subject to limited cure periods.We pay Pfizer mutually agreed-upon fees for these services, based on Pfizer's costs of providing the services. During the two years following the IPO, the markup for these services will be 0% and, for the remainder of the term of the agreement, Pfizer may introduce a markup of 7%, which we believe is consistent with arm's length pricing for the services provided. However, since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, the terms of the agreement, including the fees charged for the services, may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical financial statements. Third party costs are passed through to us at Pfizer's or its affiliates' cost. In addition, while these services are being provided to us by Pfizer, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited.We may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we receive from Pfizer under our transitional services agreement. Additionally, after the agreement terminates, we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from Pfizer. When we begin to operate these functions separately, if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place, or are unable to obtain them from other providers, we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, and our profitability may decline. If there is a later determination that the Exchange Offer or certain related transactions are taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, we could incur significant liabilities.Pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Exchange Offer will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). Completion by Pfizer of the Exchange Offer was conditioned on, among other things, the continuing application of Pfizer's private 25 |Table of Contentsletter ruling from the IRS and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel, to the effect that, among other things, the Exchange Offer will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Exchange Offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Pfizer or us after the Exchange Offer. If the Exchange Offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement.Risks related to our common stockThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and you could lose all or part of your investment in Zoetis common stock as a result.Our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors. From our IPO through December 31, 2013, the sales price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE has ranged from a low sales price of $28.81 on August 28, 2013 to a high sales price of $35.42 on March 14, 2013. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2013 Annual Report, are:•our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;•our or our competitors' press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;•changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;•changes in our investor base;•failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;•fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;•changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, including as a result of the Exchange Offer, future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders or the incurrence of additional debt;•reputational issues;•changes in general economic and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;•the arrival or departure of key personnel;•the actions of speculators and financial arbitrageurs (such as hedge funds) during and after the Exchange Offer;•changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and other dynamics; and•other developments or changes affecting us, our industry or our competitors.In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.While we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders, we may change our dividend policy at any time. On December 18, 2013, our Board of Directors declared the 2014 first quarter dividend of $0.072 per share paid on March 4, 2014 to holders of record on January 30, 2014. Although we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. Returns on stockholders' investments will primarily depend on the appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of our business, repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, cash flows available in the United States, impact on our effective tax rate, indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation,” and amended and restated by-laws, which we refer to as “our by-laws,” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids 26 |Table of Contentsand to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include:•a Board of Directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;•rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors.In addition, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our and our stockholders' best interests.Item 1B
