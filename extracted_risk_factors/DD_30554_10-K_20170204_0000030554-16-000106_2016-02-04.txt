Additional information about the Merger Agreement is set forth in the company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2015.  2Part IITEM 1.  BUSINESS, continuedSpin-off of Performance ChemicalsOn July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), the financial position and results of operations of the Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additional details related to the separation can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Productivity and Cost Savings InitiativesOn December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them.  In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of  $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs.  Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 23 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions.  DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment.  As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, pre-tax (benefits) charges of $(21) million and $541 million, respectively, were recorded.  Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Business Segments The company consists of 10 businesses which are aggregated into 6 reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment.  The company's reportable segments are Agriculture, Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition & Health, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection. The company includes certain businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as pre-commercial programs, nonaligned businesses and pharmaceuticals in Other.  Additional information with respect to business segment results is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 30 of this report and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2015, DuPont announced the consolidation of the DuPont Packaging & Industrial Polymers business with the DuPont Performance Polymers business within the Performance Materials segment, as well as the consolidation of the DuPont Protection Technologies business with the DuPont Building Innovations business within the Safety & Protection segment.  Both consolidations will be effective on January 1, 2016. The consolidations will create greater efficiency and enhanced capabilities in the two segments where these businesses operate, the Performance Materials segment and the Safety & Protection segment, respectively.  These changes will not result in a change in reportable segments.   DuPont Sustainable Solutions, within the company's Safety & Protection segment, is comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions.  Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit will become part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes.

BUSINESS, continuedAgricultureAgriculture businesses, DuPont Pioneer (Pioneer) and DuPont Crop Protection (Crop Protection), leverage the company's technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry.  Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area.  The segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and to enhance the value of grains and oilseeds through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.  Agriculture accounted for approximately 55 percent of the company's total research and development expense in 2015. Sales of the company's products in this segment are affected by the seasonality of global agriculture markets and weather patterns. Sales and earnings performance in the Agriculture segment are significantly stronger in the first versus second half of the year reflecting the northern hemisphere planting season. As a result of the seasonal nature of its business, Agriculture's inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables in the Agriculture segment are at a low point at year-end and increase through the northern hemisphere selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.Pioneer is a world leader in developing, producing and marketing corn hybrids and soybean varieties which improve the productivity and profitability of its customers.  Additionally, Pioneer develops, produces and markets canola, sunflower, sorghum, inoculants, wheat and rice.  As the world's population grows and the middle class expands, the need for crops for animal feed, food, biofuels and industrial uses continues to increase. The business competes with other seed and plant biotechnology companies.  Pioneer seed sales amounted to 27 percent, 27 percent and 28 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Pioneer's research and development focuses on integrating high yielding germplasm with value added proprietary and/or licensed native and biotechnology traits with local environment and service expertise.  Pioneer uniquely develops integrated products for specific regional application based on local product advancement and testing of the product concepts.  Research and development in this arena requires long-term commitment of resources, extensive regulatory efforts and collaborations, partnerships and business arrangements to successfully bring products to market. To protect its investment, the business employs the use of patents covering germplasm and native and biotechnology traits in accordance with country laws. Pioneer holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business.  The biotechnology traits licensed by Pioneer from third parties are contained in a variety of Pioneer crops, including corn hybrids and soybean varieties.  The majority of Pioneer’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long term licenses.                       Pioneer is actively pursuing the development of innovations for corn hybrids, soybean varieties, canola, sunflower, wheat and rice based on market assessments of the most valuable opportunities.  In corn seeds, programs include innovations for drought and nitrogen efficiency and insect protection.  In soybean seeds, programs include products with enhanced end-use value and insect protection.  Pioneer has seed production facilities located throughout the world. Seed production is performed directly by the business or contracted with independent growers and conditioners. Pioneer's ability to produce seeds primarily depends upon weather conditions and availability of reliable contract growers.Pioneer markets and sells seed product primarily under the Pioneer® brand but also sells and distributes products utilizing additional brand names.  Pioneer promotes its products through multiple marketing channels around the world. In the corn and soybean markets of the U.S. Corn Belt, Pioneer® brand products are sold primarily through a specialized force of independent sales representatives.

Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand.  Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.Intellectual Property As a science and technology based company, DuPont believes that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting its research. Some DuPont businesses operate in environments in which the availability and protection of intellectual property rights affect competition.  (Information on the importance of intellectual property rights to Pioneer is included in Item 1 Agriculture business discussion beginning on page 4 of this report.) Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property.  Many of the processes used to make DuPont products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties.  DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets.  When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate.  In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment.  7Part IITEM 1.  BUSINESS, continuedPatents & Trademarks:  DuPont continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed.  DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country.  This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across segments.  At December 31, 2015, the company owned over 21,300 patents with various expiration dates over the next 20 years. In addition to its owned patents, the company owns over 12,400 patent applications.The company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or business to business level.  Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. Research and DevelopmentDuPont conducts research and development (R&D) programs across multiple fields including agriculture, biology, chemistry, engineering, and materials science in support of the company's strategic priorities of Agriculture & Nutrition, Bio-based Industrials, and Advanced Materials. DuPont accelerates market introductions and increases the impact of its offerings through collaboration with partners in the commercial sector (customers and value chain partners) and by working with governments, academia, and local communities around the world. DuPont’s R&D objectives are to leverage the company's unique world-class science and technology capabilities with its deep understanding of markets and value chains to drive revenue and profit growth for the company thereby delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders. DuPont's R&D investment is focused on delivering value to its customers while extending its leadership across the high-value, science-driven segments of the agriculture and food value chains, strengthening its lead as provider of differentiated, high-value advanced industrial materials, and building transformational new bio-based industrial businesses. Each business in the company undertakes R&D activities to  support its objectives. In addition,  the company directs R&D to support science-intensive new growth opportunities additive to the existing business portfolios. The R&D portfolio is managed by senior business and R&D leaders to ensure consistency with the corporate and business strategies and to capitalize on the application of emerging science.  Additional information with respect to R&D related to Agriculture is included on page 4.The company continues to protect its R&D investment through its intellectual property strategy. See discussion under "Intellectual Property".Additional information with respect to R&D, including the amount incurred during each of the last three fiscal years, is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 26 of this report.Environmental MattersInformation related to environmental matters is included in several areas of this report: (1) Environmental Proceedings beginning on page 18, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on pages 41, 46-48 and (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Available InformationThe company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

BUSINESS, continuedExecutive Officers of the RegistrantInformation related to the company's Executive Officers is included in Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance, beginning on page 51 of this report.  9Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSRisks relating to the MergersAs described in Item 1, Part 1  Business, on December 11, 2015, DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses by: (i) forming Diamond-Orion HoldCo, Inc., a corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and jointly owned by DuPont and Dow (HoldCo), (ii) Dow merging with a newly formed, wholly owned direct subsidiary of HoldCo, with Dow surviving such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (the Dow Merger), and (iii) DuPont merging with a newly formed, wholly owned direct subsidiary of HoldCo, with DuPont surviving such merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (the DuPont Merger and, together with the Dow Merger, the Mergers).  Following the consummation of the Mergers, DuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of HoldCo, the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Business Separations). The risk factors below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors related to the company’s operations set forth below and other information contained in this report. HoldCo will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC that will include a joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Mergers. DuPont urges you to read the registration statement on Form S-4 once it becomes available because it will contain important information about the Mergers, including relevant risk factors. The consummation of the Mergers is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including stockholder and regulatory approvals, that are outside of DuPont’s and/or Dow’s control and that DuPont and/or Dow may be unable to obtain. The process to obtain regulatory approvals could prevent, or substantially delay, the consummation of the Mergers and DuPont cannot predict if regulators will impose additional conditions on HoldCo that may have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business or results of operations. As a result, one or more conditions to closing of the Mergers may not be satisfied and the Mergers may not be completed.The ability to consummate the  Mergers is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks that the conditions to the Mergers are not satisfied, or if possible, waived including, among others (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the common stock of each of DuPont and Dow;  (ii) the receipt of certain domestic and foreign approvals under competition laws; (iii) DuPont and Dow reasonably determining that the DuPont Merger and the Dow Merger do not constitute an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in DuPont and Dow, respectively, under the principles of Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (iv) the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of either of the Mergers.  The obligation of each of DuPont and Dow to consummate the Mergers is also conditioned on, among other things, the receipt of a tax opinion from the tax counsel as to the tax-free nature of each of the Mergers. DuPont cannot provide any assurance that the Mergers will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the Mergers. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, DuPont may incur substantial fees in connection with the termination of the transaction and DuPont will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers. Regulatory authorities may refuse to permit the Mergers or may impose restrictions or conditions on the Mergers that may harm the combined company if the Mergers are completed. Failure to consummate the Mergers substantially as contemplated in the Merger Agreement on or before March 15, 2017 or if certain antitrust-related conditions to the closing have not been satisfied and the parties therefore elect to extend, June 15, 2017, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s stock price and results of operations.  10Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThere can be no assurance that the expected benefits of the Mergers, including the Business Separations, will occur or be fully or timely realized.The success of the Mergers will depend, in part, on the combined company’s ability to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow. If the combined company is not able to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow in an efficient and effective manner, including if the intended Business Separations are delayed or ultimately not consummated, the anticipated benefits, synergies operational efficiencies and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of common stock, the revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations of the combined company may be adversely affected. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time consuming process, and the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, including, without limitation: •the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the Mergers;•ongoing diversion of the attention of management from the operation of the combined company’s business as a result of the intended business separations;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects; •challenges of managing a larger combined company addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process, including with respect to the intended Business Separations;•unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company and the intended Business Separations;•coordinating geographically separate organizations; and•unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Mergers. Some of these factors will be outside of the control of management and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenues which could materially impact the company’s business, financial conditions and results of operations. Difficulties in the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Mergers, could  adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors, and other stakeholders and could harm the reputations of DuPont, Dow and the combined company.  If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to integrate successfully DuPont’s and Dow’s operations, effect the intended business separations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower and may take longer to achieve than anticipated.DuPont will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions until the Mergers are consummated.Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and licensees as well as regulatory permits, licenses, contracts and other agreements, particularly for which  the Mergers could be deemed a “change-in-control” under the applicable  terms and conditions may have an adverse effect on DuPont, Dow and consequently on the combined company.  Changes to existing business relationships, including termination or modification, could negatively affect each of DuPont’s and/or Dow's revenues, earnings and cash flow, as well as the market price of its common stock.  These uncertainties may impair each party’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the consummation of the Mergers, and could cause suppliers, customers and others that deal with the parties to seek to change existing business relationships with them. Retention of employees could be challenging during the pendency of the Mergers due to uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company’s business following the consummation of the Mergers could be negatively impacted.  Further, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of DuPont and Dow to the same extent that DuPont and Dow have previously been able to attract or retain their employees.  11Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts each of DuPont and Dow, without the consent of the other party, from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds, repurchasing or issuing securities outside of existing share repurchase and equity award programs, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement. These restrictions may prevent or delay pursuit of strategic corporate or business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Mergers. Adverse effects arising during the pendency of the Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement.DuPont expects to incur substantial transaction-related costs in the connection with the Mergers. DuPont expects to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Mergers and the intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning.  These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operation of DuPont prior to the Mergers and of the combined company following the Mergers.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the company believes that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect its businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.The company’s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.The company’s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, including fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Although DuPont has operations throughout the world, sales outside the U.S. in 2015 were principally to customers in Eurozone countries, China, Brazil, and Japan. Further, the company’s largest currency exposures are the European Euro, Brazilian Real, the Chinese Yuan, and the Japanese Yen.  Market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for the company’s products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on DuPont’s results of operations.  In addition, changes in exchange rates may affect the company’s results from operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.  The company actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, committed currency purchases and sales, foreign currency-denominated revenues and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.  Volatility in energy and raw materials costs could have a significant impact on the company's sales and earnings.The company's manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the company. Significant variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil, natural gas, and raw materials affect the company's operating results from period to period. Legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. When possible, the company purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Additionally, the company enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. The company takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If the company is not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs, it could have a significant impact on the company's financial results. 12Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThe company's results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.Business and/or supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm the company's operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could result in misuse of the company's assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance.  Like most major corporations, the company is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. The company has determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to at least certain confidential business information. However, to date, the company has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or business operations that it attributes to these attacks. Although management does not believe that the company has experienced any material losses to date related to security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. The company actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, the company may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact sales and earnings from the company’s Agriculture segment.The agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors, which can vary unpredictably from period to period. Weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and, accordingly, can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products, including the mix of products used. The weather also can affect the quality, volume and cost of seeds produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Seed yields can be higher or lower than planned, which could lead to higher inventory and related-write-offs and affect ability to supply.Inability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company's financial results.The company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property estates, including intellectual property rights supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products, particularly agricultural and bio-based products. Speed in discovering, developing and protecting new technologies and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage. Failure to predict and respond effectively to this competition could cause the company's existing or candidate products to become less competitive, adversely affecting sales. Competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact the company's ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.Intellectual property rights, including patents, plant variety protection, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and other forms of trade dress, are important to the company's business. The company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported.  However, the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from  non-governmental organizations, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions.The company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property. Despite these precautions, the company's intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, the company reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. Accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant. See Part I, Item 1 for additional details on the company's intellectual property. 13Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedMarket acceptance, government policies, rules, regulations and competition could affect the company's ability in certain markets to generate  and sustain sales or affect profitability from products based on biotechnology.The company is using biotechnology to create and improve products, particularly in its Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences segments. The company is also using biotechnology in the development of certain products and pre-commercial programs in Other.  These products enable cost and process benefits, better product performance and functionality, and improve environmental outcomes in a broad range of products, technologies and processes such as seeds, enzymes, animal nutrition, detergents, food ingredients, ethanol production and industrial applications. The company's ability to generate and sustain sales from such products could be impacted by market acceptance, including perception of benefits and costs relative to products based on conventional technologies, as well as governmental policies, laws and regulations that affect the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, particularly the testing and planting of seeds containing biotechnology traits and the import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds.In order to maintain its right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products containing biotechnology traits, particularly seed products, the company must be able to demonstrate its ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies. Sales into and use of seeds with biotechnology traits in jurisdictions where cultivation has been approved could be affected if key import markets have not approved the import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds. If import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds containing such biotechnology traits occurs in these markets, it could lead to disruption in trade and potential liability for the company.In addition, the company’s regulatory compliance could be affected by the detection of low level presence of biotechnology traits in conventional seed or products produced from such seed. Furthermore, the detection of biotechnology traits not approved in the country of cultivation may affect the company’s ability to supply product and could affect exports of products produced from such seeds and even result in crop destruction or product recalls.DuPont’s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for some of its  products in the Agriculture segment could limit sales or affect profitability in certain markets.In most jurisdictions, the company must test the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of its Agricultural products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the necessary approvals. In certain jurisdictions the company must periodically renew its approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards. The regulatory environment is lengthy,  complex and in some markets unpredictable,  with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. The regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance.  Responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability.  The failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on the company’s  ability to produce and sell some current and future products.The company might not realize all of the expected benefits from cost and productivity initiatives to the extent and as anticipated.In connection with its ongoing review of costs, working capital performance and capital spending, in December 2015, the company announced a global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce costs in 2016 by $730 million as compared with 2015. Also in connection with this review, the company has elected to defer certain projects including the design, testing and deployment of a multi-year, phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for information technology, sourcing and finance functions. The company has no current intention to abandon the ERP implementation.  However, depending on the length of the deferment and future implementation plans, the company’s current investment could become impaired and significant additional investment could be required. Failure to effectively implement cost and productivity initiatives, including the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan as planned could adversely affect the company’s financial results. 14Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our future results.From time to time, the company evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit its business and/or growth objectives. If the company is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, the company could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. The company continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. However, the company may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the company’s earnings. Moreover, the company might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings.The company's business, including its results of operations and reputation, could be adversely affected by process safety and product stewardship issues. Failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with the company's products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, the environment, the company's reputation and its results of operations. Public perception of the risks associated with the company's products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which the company operates. While the company has procedures and controls to manage process safety risks, issues could be created by events outside of its control including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and substandard performance by the company's external partners.As a result of the company's current and past operations, including operations related to divested businesses, the company could incur significant environmental liabilities.The company is subject to various laws and regulations around the world governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result of its operations, including its past operations and operations of divested businesses, the company could incur substantial costs, including remediation and restoration costs. The costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. The company's accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs. At December 31, 2015, the company had recognized a liability of $492 million related to the matters. Since considerable uncertainty exists, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued at December 31, 2015. As described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont and Chemours entered a Separation Agreement in connection with the spin-off of Chemours on July 1, 2015.  Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters that have an estimated liability of $291 million as of December 31, 2015 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $610 million above the amount accrued.  As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $291 million corresponding to the company’s accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2015. If based on the actions, results of operations or financial position of Chemours, it were no longer probable that the Chemours’ indemnification obligations would be satisfied, then the company could not continue to recognize the related indemnification asset adversely impacting DuPont’s financial position. Additional details on the company’s risks associated with environmental laws, regulations and environmental liabilities can be found in Part I, Item 1, Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 46 of this report and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 15Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThe company's results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.The company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability, patent infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries. The company also has noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company's financial results.In the ordinary course of business, the company may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations. If the company were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting the company's results of operations.Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Chemours indemnifies DuPont against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. If based on the actions, results of operations or financial position of Chemours, it were no longer probable that the Chemours’ indemnification obligations would be satisfied, then the company could not continue to recognize the related indemnification asset adversely impacting DuPont’s financial position. 16Part IITEM 1B
