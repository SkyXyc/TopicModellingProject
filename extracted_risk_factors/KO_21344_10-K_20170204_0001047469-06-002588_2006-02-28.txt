Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. 

        All
four of these challenges and risks—obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences and increased competition and capabilities
in the marketplace—have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however, we believe
our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.

NAME="page_do1033_1_34">   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require management to
make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and
estimates relate to the following: 



•Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation
•Recoverability
of Noncurrent Assets
•Revenue
Recognition
•Income
Taxes
•Contingencies



        Management
has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our
estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future,
actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. 



 Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  



        In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities" ("Interpretation 46(R)"). We adopted Interpretation 46(R) effective April 2, 2004. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        Our
Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary.
Our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our Company's level of involvement in setting up the entity, determining if the
activities of the entity are substantially conducted on behalf of our Company, determining whether the Company provides more than half of the subordinated financial support to the entity, and
determining if we absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses or returns. 

        We
use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Our consolidated net income
includes our Company's share of the net earnings of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our
ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. 


        We
use the cost method to account for investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate. We record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. 

        Our
Company eliminates from financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. 



 Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets  



        Management's assessments of the recoverability of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These assessments reflect management's best
assumptions, which, when appropriate, are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. Factors that management must 

34




 

estimate
when performing recoverability and impairment tests include, among others, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and
capital spending. These factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation. These factors include inherent uncertainties, and significant management judgment is involved in
estimating their impact. However, when appropriate, the assumptions we use for financial reporting purposes are consistent with those we use in our internal planning and we believe are consistent with
those that a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors. The variability of these
factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been
used in the current period, the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future
periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. 

        Operating
in more than 200 countries subjects our Company to many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments. Refer to the headings "Our
Business—Challenges and Risks" above and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant
amount of judgment when determining the recoverability of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. 


        For
the noncurrent assets listed in the table below, we perform tests of impairment, as appropriate. For applicable assets, we perform tests when certain conditions exist that indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. For certain assets, we perform tests at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired:

        Many of the noncurrent assets listed above are located in markets that we consider to be developing or to have changing political environments.
These markets include, but are not limited to, Germany, where the nonrefillable deposit law creates uncertainty; the Middle East and Egypt, where political and civil unrest continues; the Philippines,
where affordable packaging and availability of beverages in the marketplace continue to impact operating results; India, where affordability and bottler execution issues remain; and certain markets in
Latin America, Asia and Africa, where local economic and political conditions are unstable. We have bottling

 Equity Method and Cost Method Investments  



        We review our equity and cost method investments in every reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that
may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to the carrying value of the related investments. We also
perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which the carrying value has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in
publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation
methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flows or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash
flows, especially in developing and unstable markets, may impact the determination of fair value. 

        In
the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, management may be required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Management's assessments as to
the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above, our ability and intent to hold the investment, and whether evidence indicating the cost of the
investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. We consider most of our equity method investees to be strategic long-term investments. If
the fair value of an investment is less than its carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, a write-down is recorded. Management's assessments of
fair value represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If different
fair values were estimated, this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The current decline in value is considered to be temporary.






 Other Assets  



        Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.
Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the period benefited.
Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
Management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable by preparing
estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. If the carrying value of the assets is assessed to be recoverable, it is amortized over the periods benefited. If the carrying
value of these assets is considered to be not recoverable, an impairment is recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets. 



 Property, Plant and Equipment  



        Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed. Such
events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with
historical losses or projected future losses. If an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. 



 Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets  



        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," classifies intangible assets into three categories:
(1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets
with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests
for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our equity method investees also perform such tests for
impairment for intangible assets and/or goodwill. If an impairment 

37




 

charge
was recorded by one of our equity method investees the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge. 

        Our
trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, if conditions exist that
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, we review such trademarks and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued. Such conditions
may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations. Trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We
test such trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Goodwill is
not amortized. We also perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired. All goodwill is assigned to reporting units,
which are one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination. We perform our impairment tests of
goodwill at our reporting unit level. Impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a variety of
methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments, including cash flow analyses that, when appropriate, are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use, estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals. Where applicable, we use an appropriate discount rate, based on the Company's cost of capital rate or location-specific economic
factors. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $84 million related to intangible assets. These intangible assets relate to trademarks for beverages sold in the
Philippines. The Philippines is a component of our East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. The carrying value of our trademarks in the Philippines, prior to the recording of the impairment
charges in 2005, was approximately $268 million. The impairment was the result of our revised outlook of the Philippines, which has been unfavorably impacted by declines in volume and income
before income taxes resulting from the continued lack of an affordable package offering and the continued limited availability of these trademark beverages in the marketplace. We determined the amount
of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the current carrying value. Fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a
number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets, we recorded impairment charges to
reduce the carrying values of the assets to fair values. In addition, in 2005, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $4 million in the line item equity income—net
related to our proportionate share of a write-down of intangible assets recorded by our equity method investee bottler in the Philippines. Our Company is evaluating and implementing new
strategies for the Philippines to address structural issues with the bottling system and product affordability and availability issues. If the results of these strategies do not achieve our current
expectations, future charges could result related to both our remaining intangible assets as well as our equity method investment in the Philippines bottling operation. Management will continue to
monitor the Philippines and conduct impairment reviews as required. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded impairment charges related to intangible assets of approximately $374 million, primarily related to franchise rights at CCEAG in the European Union
operating segment. The CCEAG impairment was the result of our revised outlook for the German market, which was unfavorably impacted by volume declines resulting from market shifts related to the
deposit law on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding lack of availability of our products in the discount retail channel. The deposit law in Germany had led to discount chains creating
proprietary nonrefillable packages that could only be returned to their own stores. We determined the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the current
carrying value. Fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair value was
less than the carrying value of the assets, we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other
operating charges in our 

38




 


consolidated
statement of income for 2004. At the end of 2004, the German government passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that requires retailers, including discount chains, to
accept returns of each type of nonrefillable beverage packages they sell, regardless of where the beverage package type was purchased. In addition, the mandatory deposit requirement was expanded to
other beverage categories. The amendment allows for a transition period to enable manufacturers and retailers to establish a national take-back system for nonrefillable containers by
mid-2006. In the second half of 2005, the Company achieved a limited range of availability of our products in most discounters. As a result, the business in Germany stabilized in the second half of
2005. We currently expect that the national take-back system, when fully implemented, will create an opportunity to improve package choice and differentiation for nonrefillable packages.
We expect the German business to continue to stabilize in 2006. 

        Our
Company evaluated our strategies for the German operations, including addressing significant structural issues that limit the system's ability to respond effectively to the evolving
retail and consumer landscape, by assessing market changes and determining our expectations related to the political environment. We concluded that, in order to better serve our customers and control
the costs in our supply chain, we need to simplify our bottling and distribution operations in Germany and work toward a single bottler system. As a result, we informed our independent bottling
partners in Germany that their Bottlers' Agreements will not be renewed when they expire, from 2007 through 2011. The independent bottling partners in Germany and our Company signed a letter of
understanding with respect to the formation of a single bottler system and are working to agree to an approach. 

        If
the results of our strategies in Germany do not achieve our current expectations, or delays and changes occur in the establishment of the national take-back system for
nonrefillable packages, future impairment charges could result. Management will continue to monitor these factors. 



 Revenue Recognition  



        We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers.
In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transaction. 

        In
addition, our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on
infrastructure programs, was approximately $3.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 



 Income Taxes  



        Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay
additional taxes related to certain matters. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of
a tax audit. 

        A
number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending
on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we record a 

39




 


reserve
when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable. Such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued income taxes in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Settlement of any
particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense
when the amounts involved become known. 

        Tax
law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate
reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not
deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities
are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits,
such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. 

        We
evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating
results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be
established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. 


        Additionally,
undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference, except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a
foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction. The Company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable jurisdictions. Should we change our plans, we would be required to record a significant amount of
deferred tax liabilities. 

        The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Creation Act") was enacted in October 2004. Among other things, it provided a one-time benefit related to foreign tax credits
generated by equity investments in prior years. In 2004, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of this new law. The Jobs Creation Act also included
a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately
$6.1 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings, with an associated tax liability of
approximately $315 million. The reinvestment requirements of this repatriation are expected to be fulfilled by 2008 and are not expected to require any material change in the nature, amount or
timing of future expenditures from what was otherwise expected. Refer to Note 1 and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        The
Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24 percent in 2006. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may
affect our tax rate in 2006. 



 Contingencies  



        Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent
uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and
accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings
or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements  



        Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. 

Operations Review  

        We manufacture, distribute and market nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in more than 200 countries around the world. We also manufacture, distribute
and market some finished beverages. Due to our global presence, we are primarily managed by geographic regions. Our organizational structure as of December 31, 2005 consisted of the following
operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups": North America; Africa; East, South Asia and Pacific Rim; European Union; Latin America; North
Asia, Eurasia and Middle East; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, including a discussion of changes made to our operating segments during 2005, refer to
Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 



 Volume  



        We measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) gallons. A "unit case" is a unit of measurement equal to 192
U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume represents the number of unit cases of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the
Coca-Cola system to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or
distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which it derives income. Such products
licensed
to, or distributed by, our Company or owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint
ventures in which the Company is a partner. Unit case volume is derived based on estimates supplied by our bottling partners and distributors. A "gallon" is a unit of measurement for concentrates,
syrups, beverage bases, finished beverages and powders (in all cases expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup) sold by the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Most of our revenues are
based on gallon sales, a primarily wholesale activity, as discussed under "Item 1. Business" in Part I of this report and the heading "Operations Review—Net Operating Revenues,"
below. Unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Items such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price
increases and new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and gallon sales and can create differences between unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates.

 Unit Case Volume  



        Although most of our Company's revenues are not based directly on unit case volume, we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength
of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The Coca-Cola system sold approximately 20.6 billion unit cases of our products in 2005,
approximately 19.8 billion unit cases in 2004, and approximately 19.4 billion unit cases in 2003. 

        In
the North America operating segment, unit case volume in the Retail Division increased 2 percent in 2005 versus 2004, reflecting improved performance in the bottle-delivered
business primarily related to Dasani, Coca-Cola Zero and noncarbonated beverages, along with growth in the warehouse juice and warehouse water operations. The Foodservice and Hospitality Division had
a 1 percent increase in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting improved trends in restaurant traffic and the impact of new customer conversion partially offset by the impact of higher fuel costs and
Hurricane Katrina on consumer restaurant spending. 

        In
the Africa operating segment, unit case volume increased 6 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was driven by growth in core carbonated soft drinks as well as
noncarbonated beverages across all divisions in this operating segment. 

        In
the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment, unit case volume decreased 4 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to declines in India and the Philippines.
The decline in India was related to the impact of price increases to cover rising raw material and distribution costs and the lingering effects of the 2003 pesticide allegations. The decline in the
Philippines was primarily related to affordability and availability issues. Both markets are expected to remain challenging in 2006. 

        Unit
case volume in the European Union operating segment was even in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to strong growth in Spain and Central Europe partially offset by declines primarily
in Germany and Northwest Europe. Unit case volume in Germany declined 2 percent in 2005 due to the continued impact of the mandatory deposit legislation on the availability of nonrefillable
packages and the corresponding limited availability of our products in the discount retail channel, along with overall industry weakness. In the second half of 2005, the Company achieved a limited
range of availability of its products in most discounters. Results in Germany stabilized in the second half of 2005, and we expect this to continue into 2006. Unit case volume in Northwest Europe
declined 3 percent in 2005, primarily due to the soft economic environment and declines in the carbonated soft drink category, which is associated with a decrease in prices at retailers, and
the discount channel becoming a larger part of the retail market, together with a shift in consumer preferences away from regular carbonated soft drinks driven by health and wellness trends and the
associated public opinion, media and government attention. 

        Unit
case volume for the Latin America operating segment increased 6 percent in 2005 versus 2004, reflecting strong growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, primarily due to growth
in carbonated soft drinks. The increase in Brazil and Mexico was primarily due to strong marketing, execution and package innovation. 

        In
the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment, unit case volume grew 15 percent in 2005 versus 2004, led by 22 percent growth in China, 2 percent
growth in Japan, 54 percent growth in Russia and 14 percent growth in Turkey. The increase in unit case volume in China was led by significant growth in both carbonated soft drinks and
noncarbonated beverages. Japan's growth was primarily due to new product introductions. The unit case volume growth in Turkey was largely due to improving macroeconomic trends, strong bottler
execution and successful marketing programs. The unit case volume growth in Russia was the result of the joint acquisition of Multon as well as improving macroeconomic trends, strong bottler execution
and successful marketing programs. 

        In
the North America operating segment, unit case volume for 2004 was even compared to 2003. The Retail Division had a 1 percent decrease in unit case volume in 2004 versus 2003,
primarily due to poor weather in the third quarter, higher retail pricing and lower than expected results from Coca-Cola C2. The Foodservice and 

42




 


Hospitality
Division's unit case volume increased 2 percent as a result of effective customer programs and improved restaurant traffic. 

        In
the Africa operating segment, unit case volume increased 3 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the growth in South Africa, where unit case volume
increased 7 percent, and in Morocco and Kenya. These increases were partially offset by unit case volume declines in Nigeria, due to de-emphasis on less-profitable water
packages and weakness in noncore brands, and in Egypt. 

        In
the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment, unit case volume increased 1 percent in 2004 versus 2003, primarily as a result of the growth in the South East and West
Asia Division, partially offset by an 8 percent decline in the Philippines due to affordability and availability issues. 

        Unit
case volume in the European Union operating segment decreased 3 percent in 2004 versus 2003, primarily due to limited brand and package availability in the discount retail
channel in Germany resulting from the mandatory deposit legislation and poor weather conditions in northern Europe. 


        Unit
case volume for the Latin America operating segment increased 3 percent in 2004 versus 2003, primarily reflecting strong growth in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela resulting
from the execution of the Company's long-term investment strategy with an emphasis on brand building, new package alternatives, and close coordination with bottling partners to drive
superior local marketplace execution, offset by a de-emphasis on large-format water and powdered drinks in Mexico. 

        The
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment's unit case volume increased 12 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily led by 22 percent growth in China as a
result of a new advertising campaign, innovative packaging and promotion in the cities, and affordable 200ml packaging in the towns. Japan's growth of 4 percent was driven by Trademark
Coca-Cola unit case volume growth of 3 percent and Trademark Fanta growth of 17 percent. Unit case volume growth in Turkey, Russia and the Middle East was mainly due to
successful promotions and continued positive economic trends. 



 Gallon Sales  



        In 2005, the 1 percent increase in gallon sales in the North America operating segment was primarily related to the Retail Division. In Africa, the
7 percent gallon sales growth was led by South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt. In Latin America, the 6 percent gallon sales increase was led by growth in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The
12 percent increase in gallon sales in the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment was primarily due to growth in China, Russia and Turkey. Japan gallon sales were slightly higher
in 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in gallon sales in the North America; the Africa; the Latin America; and the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segments were offset by a
1 percent decrease in the European Union operating segment and a 6 percent decrease in the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. In the European Union operating segment,
gallon sales decreased 1 percent, with the largest declines occurring in Germany and Northwest Europe, partially offset by growth in Spain and Central Europe. In the East, South Asia and
Pacific Rim operating segment, gallon sales decreased 6 percent, primarily due to the continuing challenging conditions in India and the Philippines. 


        The
decrease in gallon sales in Germany was primarily due to the continuing impact of the mandatory deposit legislation on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding limited
availability of our products in the discount retail channel, along with overall industry weakness. In the second half of 2005, the Company achieved a limited range of availability of its products in
most discounters. Results in Germany stabilized in the second half of 2005. The German legislature passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that will require retailers, including
discounters, to accept returns of each type of nonrefillable beverage containers they sell, regardless of where the beverage package type was purchased, the amendment allows for a transition period
until mid-2006. We expect the German business to continue to stabilize during 2006. For a discussion of the operating environment in Germany, refer to the heading "Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates— 

43




 


Goodwill,
Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets." We will continue to focus on improving our short-term performance and strengthening our system's long-term capabilities in
Germany. The decrease in gallon sales in Northwest Europe was primarily due to the soft economic environment and declines in the carbonated soft drink category, which is associated with a decrease in
prices at retailers, and the discount channel becoming a larger part of the retail market, together with a shift in consumer preferences away from regular carbonated soft drinks driven by health and
wellness trends and the associated public opinion, media and government attention. 

        The
decrease in gallon sales in India was primarily due to the impact of price increases to cover rising raw material and distribution costs and the lingering effects of the 2003
pesticide allegations. The decline in gallon sales in the Philippines was primarily due to continued affordability and availability issues. The Company is continuing to focus on improving our
performance in these markets; however, India and the Philippines will remain difficult during 2006. 


        Company-wide
gallon sales grew 3 percent while unit case volume grew 4 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. In the North America operating segment, gallon sales increased
1 percent while unit case volume increased 2 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the impact of higher gallon sales in 2004 related to the launch of Coca-Cola
C2 and a change in shipping routes in 2004. In the Africa operating segment, gallon sales growth of 7 percent exceeded unit case volume growth of 6 percent, primarily due to timing of
gallon shipments. In the European Union operating segment, gallon sales declined by 1 percent while unit case volume was even in 2005, mostly due to the timing of 2004 gallon sales throughout
most of the operating segment and planned inventory reductions primarily in Spain, Greece and Israel. In the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment, gallon sales declines were ahead of
unit case volume declines primarily due to timing of gallon sales in India and the Philippines and planned inventory reductions in Australia. In the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating
segment, unit case volume increased ahead of gallon sales volume due to the joint acquisition of Multon, which contributed to unit case volume in 2005, along with timing of 2004 gallon sales impacting
most of the remaining divisions in the operating segment. Multon had full year unit case volume of approximately 80 million unit cases in 2004. The Company reports only unit case volume related
to Multon, as the Company does not sell concentrate to Multon. In the Latin America operating segment, gallon sales growth and unit case volume growth were approximately equal in 2005 compared to
2004. 

        The
2 percent increase in gallon sales in the North America operating segment in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily related to 4 percent growth in the Foodservice and
Hospitality Division and 1 percent growth in the Retail Division. The 4 percent growth in the Africa operating segment was led mainly by South Africa. The 3 percent increase in
the Latin America operating segment was primarily driven by growth in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment's growth of 12 percent was driven
by gallon sales growth in China, Turkey and Russia. The 3 percent decrease in gallon sales in the European Union resulted primarily from the decline in Germany primarily due to market shifts
related to the deposit law on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding lack of availability of our products in the discount retail channel. The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating
segment's gallon sales decreased 2 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to inventory reductions in India and challenging conditions in the Philippines. 

        Company-wide
gallon sales growth of 2 percent was in line with unit case volume growth in 2004 compared to 2003. However, in the North America operating segment, gallon sales
increased 2 percent while unit case volume was even due to lower gallon sales in 2003, additional 2004 shipments related to new product introductions, changes in our shipping routes and higher
than expected year end sales. In the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment, gallon sales declined 2 percent while unit case sales increased 1 percent primarily due to timing
of gallon sales.

 Net Operating Revenues  



        Net operating revenues increased by $1,362 million or 6 percent in 2005 versus 2004. Net operating revenues increased by $885 million or

        Refer to the heading "Volume" for a detailed discussion on gallon sales. 

        Structural
changes refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of entities for accounting purposes. During the third
quarter of 2005, our Company acquired the German soft drink bottling company Bremer Erfrischungsgetraenke GmbH ("Bremer"). Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Structural changes also reflect the impact of a full year of revenue in 2005 for variable interest entities compared to a partial year in 2004. Under Interpretation 46(R), the results of
operations of variable interest entities in which the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary were included in our consolidated results beginning April 2, 2004. Refer to
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        The
favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2005 versus 2004 resulted from the strength of most key foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, especially a stronger euro
that favorably impacted the European Union operating segment, and a stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso that favorably impacted our Latin America operating segment. The favorable impact of
fluctuation in these currencies was offset by a weaker Japanese yen that unfavorably impacted the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital
Resources and Financial Position—Foreign Exchange." 

        Structural
changes resulted in a decrease in net operating revenues in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the creation of a national supply chain company in Japan in 2003. Effective
October 1, 2003, the Company and all of our bottling partners in Japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement, production and logistics
operations for the entire Coca-Cola system in Japan. As a result, a portion of our Company's business was essentially converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate
business model. This shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in reductions in our revenues and cost of goods sold, each in the same amount. This change in the business model
did not impact gross profit. The decrease in net revenues from 2003 to 2004 attributable to the Japan structural change was approximately $780 million, which was partially offset by an
approximately $260 million increase in revenues associated with the consolidation as of April 2, 2004 of certain bottling operations that are considered variable interest entities under
Interpretation 46(R). Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        The
impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar in 2004 versus 2003 was driven primarily by the stronger euro, which favorably impacted the European Union operating
segment, and the stronger Japanese yen, which favorably impacted the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment.

        The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain segments growing at a faster rate
compared to the other operating segments and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

        Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company granted our bottling partners in Spain the rights to manufacture and distribute Company trademarked products in can packages. Prior to
granting these rights to our bottling partners, the Company held the manufacturing and distribution rights for these can packages in Spain. As a result of granting these rights, the Company will
reduce our planned future annual marketing support payments made to our bottling partners in Spain. As a result, a portion of our Company's business has
essentially been converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model. This shift to a concentrate business model will result in an annual reduction to net revenues. The
Company estimates the decrease in annual net revenues from this structural change to be approximately $775 million. We do not believe this change in business model will have a significant
impact on gross profit. 

        The
size and timing of structural changes, including acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and canning operations, do not occur consistently from period to period. As a result,
anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues (and other financial statement line items) usually is not possible. However, we expect to continue to
sell bottling and canning interests and buy bottling and canning interests in limited circumstances and, as a result, structural changes will continue to affect our consolidated financial statements
in future periods. 



 Gross Profit  



        Our gross profit margin decreased to 64.5 percent in 2005 from 64.7 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs driven
by rising oil prices. This decrease was partially offset by the receipt of settlement proceeds of approximately $109 million related to a class action lawsuit settlement concerning price-fixing
in the sale of high fructose corn syrup purchased by the Company during the years 1991 to 1995. Subsequent to the receipt of this settlement, the Company distributed approximately $62 million
to certain bottlers in North America. From 1991 to 1995, the Company purchased high fructose corn syrup on behalf of these bottlers; therefore, these bottlers were ultimately entitled to the proceeds
of the settlement. The Company's portion of the settlement was approximately $47 million, which was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and impacted the Corporate operating segment.
Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our gross margin was also impacted by the consolidation of certain bottling operations under Interpretation 46(R) as of
April 2, 2004. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, bottling and finished product operations produce higher net revenues but lower gross profit
margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. 

        Gross
profit margin was approximately 2 percentage points higher in 2004 versus 2003. This increase was primarily the result of the creation of a nationally integrated supply
chain management company in Japan in October 2003 (refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above), partially offset by the consolidation as of 

47




 


April 2,
2004, of variable interest entities under Interpretation 46(R). Generally, bottling and finished product operations, such as our Japan tea business, which was integrated into the
supply chain company, produce higher net revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. 



 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  



        The following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):

$  7,890
 
$  7,287








        Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 11 percent higher in 2005 versus 2004. Approximately 1 percentage
point of this increase was due to an overall weaker U.S. dollar (especially compared to the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the euro). The increase in selling, advertising and general and
administrative expenses is primarily related to increased marketing and innovation expenses and the full-year impact of the consolidation of certain bottling operations under Interpretation 46(R). Our
Company intends to maintain the increased level in marketing and innovation spending for the foreseeable future. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to the lower
average fair value per share of stock options expensed in the current year compared to the average fair value per share expensed in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by approximately
$50 million of accelerated amortization
of compensation expense related to a change in our estimated service period for retirement-eligible participants when the terms of their stock-based compensation awards provided for accelerated
vesting upon early retirement. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        Selling,
general and administrative expenses were approximately 8 percent higher in 2004 versus 2003. Approximately 3 percentage points of this increase was due to an
overall weaker U.S. dollar (especially compared to the euro and Japanese yen). Increased selling expenses were due to increased delivery costs related to our Company's finished products business and
structural changes. Increased advertising expenses were the result of investments in marketing activities, such as the launch of new products in North America and Japan. Additionally, general and
administrative expenses increased due to higher legal expenses, asset write-offs and structural changes. Finally, we received a $75 million insurance settlement related to the class
action lawsuit that was settled in 2000. The Company subsequently donated $75 million to The Coca-Cola Foundation.

        Other operating charges in 2005 reflected the impact of approximately $84 million of expenses related to impairment charges for intangible
assets and approximately $1 million related to an impairment of other assets. These intangible assets primarily relate to trademark beverages sold in the Philippines, which is part of the East,
South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets." 


        Other
operating charges in 2004 reflected the impact of approximately $480 million of expenses primarily related to impairment charges for franchise rights and certain
manufacturing assets. The European Union operating segment accounted for approximately $368 million of the impairment charges, which were primarily related to the impairment of franchise rights
at CCEAG. For a discussion of the operating environment in Germany, refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets." The
Corporate operating segment accounted for approximately $64 million of impairment charges, which were primarily related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets. 


        Other
operating charges in 2003 included the impact of approximately $561 million of expenses related to the 2003 streamlining initiatives. A majority of the charges related to
initiatives in North America and Germany. In North America, the Company integrated the operations of three separate North American business units—Coca-Cola North America, The
Minute Maid Company and Coca-Cola Fountain. In Germany, CCEAG took steps to improve its efficiency in sales, distribution and manufacturing, and our German Division office also implemented
streamlining initiatives. Selected other locations also took steps to streamline their operations to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness. These initiatives resulted in the separation of
approximately 3,700 associates in 2003, primarily in North America and Germany, and certain countries in the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

        As demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by each operating segment fluctuated
from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events, primarily the following: 



•In
2005, operating income increased approximately 7 percent. Of this amount, 4 percent was due to favorable foreign currency exchange primarily related to the
Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, which impacted the Latin America operating segment, and the euro, which impacted the European Union operating segment.
•In
2005, the increase in net operating revenues and gross profit was partially offset by increased spending on marketing and innovation activities in each operating segment.
Refer to the headings "Net Operating Revenues" and "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses."
•In
2005, as a result of impairment charges totaling approximately $85 million related to the Philippines, operating margins in the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim
operating segment decreased. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges."
•In
2005, operating income in the Corporate operating segment decreased $146 million, primarily due to increased marketing and innovation expenses, which were
partially offset by our receipt of a net settlement of approximately $47 million related to a class action lawsuit concerning the purchase of high fructose corn syrup. Refer to the headings
"Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses."
•In
2004, operating income was reduced by approximately $18 million for the North America operating segment; $15 million for the East, South Asia and Pacific
Rim operating segment; $368 million for the European Union operating segment; $6 million for the Latin America operating segment; $9 million for
the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment and $64 million for Corporate as a result of impairment charges. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges."
•In
2004, operating income increased approximately 9 percent. Of this amount, 8 percent was due to favorable foreign currency exchange primarily related to the
euro, which impacted the European Union operating segment, and the Japanese yen, which impacted the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment.
•In
2004, as a result of the creation of a nationally integrated supply chain management company in Japan, operating margins in the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East
operating segment increased. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading "Net
Operating Revenues."
•In
2004, operating income in the Corporate operating segment increased $75 million due to the receipt of an insurance settlement related to the class action lawsuit
which was settled in 2000.
•In
2004, operating income in the Corporate operating segment decreased $75 million due to a donation to The Coca-Cola Foundation.
•In
2004, as a result of the consolidation of certain bottling operations that are considered variable interest entities under Interpretation 46(R), operating margins for the
Africa; East, South Asia and Pacific Rim; European Union; and North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segments were reduced. Generally, bottling operations produce higher net revenues but lower
operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations.
•As
a result of streamlining charges, 2003 operating income was reduced by approximately $273 million for the North America operating segment, $12 million for
the Africa operating segment, $11 million for the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segments, $157 million for the European Union operating segment, $8 million for the
Latin America operating segment, $33 million for North Asia, Eurasia and 

50




 



Middle
East operating segment and $67 million for the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 



•In
2003, operating income of the European Union operating segment significantly increased due to innovation and strong marketing strategies, rigorous cost management,
positive currency trends and favorable weather during the summer months.
•As
a result of the Company's receipt of a settlement related to a vitamin antitrust litigation matter operating income in 2003 increased by approximately $52 million
for Corporate. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 



 Interest Income and Interest Expense  



        We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of term debt versus non-term debt. From time to
time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. 

        In
2005, interest income increased by $78 million compared to 2004, primarily due to higher average short-term investment balances and higher average interest rates on
U.S. dollar denominated deposits. Interest expense in 2005 increased by $44 million compared to 2004, primarily due to higher average interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in the United
States, partially offset by lower interest expense at CCEAG due to the repayment of current maturities of long-term debt in 2005. 


        In
2004, interest income decreased by $19 million compared to 2003, primarily due to lower interest income earned on short-term investments and interest income in 2003
related to certain tax receivables. While our Company's average short-term investment balances increased during 2004, significant amounts of these balances were held in lower
interest-earning locations than in prior years
while the Company analyzed the impact of the Jobs Creation Act. Interest expense in 2004 increased by $18 million compared to 2003, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates and
higher average balances on commercial paper borrowings in the United States. 



 Equity Income—Net  



        Our Company's share of income from equity method investments for 2005 totaled $680 million compared to $621 million in 2004, an increase of
approximately $59 million or 10 percent, primarily due to the overall improving health of the Coca-Cola bottling system in most of the world and the joint acquisition of
Multon in April 2005. The increase was offset by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of certain charges recorded by CCE. These charges included approximately
$51 million, primarily related to the tax liability resulting from the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act, and approximately $18 million
due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE. These charges were offset by approximately $37 million from CCE's high fructose corn syrup lawsuit settlement and changes in certain of CCE's state
and provincial tax rates. 

        Our
Company's share of income from equity method investments for 2004 totaled $621 million compared to $406 million in 2003, an increase of $215 million or
53 percent. Equity income for 2004 benefited by approximately $37 million from our proportionate share of a favorable tax settlement related to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Additionally,
our equity income for 2003 was negatively impacted by a $102 million charge primarily related to Coca-Cola FEMSA, as described below. Comparing 2004 to 2003, our equity income also
benefited from favorable pricing at key bottling operations, the positive impact of the strength of most key currencies versus the U.S. dollar, especially a stronger euro, and the overall improving
health of the Coca-Cola bottling system in most of the world. 

        Effective
May 6, 2003, one of our Company's Latin American equity method investees, Coca-Cola FEMSA, consummated a merger with another of the Company's Latin American
equity method investees, Panamerican Beverages, Inc. ("Panamco"). Our Company received new Coca-Cola FEMSA shares in exchange for all the 

51




 


Panamco
shares previously held by the Company. Our Company's ownership interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA increased from 30 percent to approximately 40 percent as a result of this
merger. This exchange of shares was treated as a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets, and no gain was recorded by our Company as a result of this merger. In connection with the merger,
Coca-Cola FEMSA management initiated steps to streamline and integrate the operations. This process included the closing of various distribution centers and manufacturing plants.
Furthermore, due to the challenging economic conditions and an uncertain political situation in Venezuela, certain intangible assets were determined to be impaired and written down to their fair
market value. During 2003, our Company recorded a noncash charge of $102 million primarily related to our proportionate share of these matters. This charge is included in the line item equity
income—net. 



 Other Loss—Net  



        Other loss—net amounted to a net loss of $93 million for 2005 compared to a net loss of $82 million for 2004. This line item in 2005
primarily consisted of $23 million in foreign currency exchange losses, the accretion of $60 million for the discounted value of our liability to purchase CCEAG shares (refer to
Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the minority shareowners' proportional share of net income of certain consolidated subsidiaries. 

        Other
loss—net amounted to a net loss of $82 million for 2004 compared to a net loss of $138 million for 2003, a difference of $56 million. Approximately
$37 million of this difference is related to a reduction in foreign exchange losses. This line item in 2004 primarily consisted of foreign exchange losses of approximately $39 million,
the accretion of $58 million for the discounted value of our liability to purchase CCEAG shares (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the minority
shareowners' proportional share of net income on certain consolidated subsidiaries. 



 Gains on Issuances of Stock by Equity Method Investees  



        When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee decreases. In the event the
issuance price per share is higher or lower than our
average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance, when appropriate. This noncash gain or loss, net of any deferred taxes, is recognized in our net income in the
period the change of ownership interest occurs. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by equity method investees. The issuances primarily related to Coca-Cola
Amatil's issuance of common stock in connection with the acquisition of SPC Ardmona Pty. Ltd., an Australian packaged fruit company. These issuances of common stock reduced our ownership
interest in the total outstanding shares of Coca-Cola Amatil from approximately 34 percent to approximately 32 percent. 


        In
2004, our Company recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains due to the issuances of stock by CCE. The issuances primarily related to the exercise of CCE stock
options by CCE employees at amounts greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. These issuances of stock reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE
common stock from approximately 37 percent to approximately 36 percent. 

        In
2003, our Company recorded approximately $8 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by equity method investees. These gains primarily related to the issuance by
CCE of common stock valued at an amount greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. These issuances of stock reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE
common stock by less than 1 percent. 



 Income Taxes  



        Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S.
statutory rate of 35 percent. 

52




 

        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 27.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, included the following: 



•an
income tax benefit primarily related to the Philippines impairment charges at a rate of approximately 4 percent;
•an
income tax benefit of approximately $101 million related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax
matters; and
•a
tax provision of approximately $315 million related to repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act. 


        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 22.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004, included the following: 



•an
income tax benefit of approximately $128 million related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax
matters;
•an
income tax benefit on "Other Operating Charges," discussed above, at a rate of approximately 36 percent;
•an
income tax provision of approximately $75 million related to the recording of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of CCEAG; and
•an
income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of the realization of certain tax credits related to the Jobs Creation Act. 


        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 20.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, included the following: 



•an
income tax benefit of approximately $50 million related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax matters
partially offset by additional taxes primarily related to the repatriation of funds;
•the
effective tax rate for the costs related to the streamlining initiatives of approximately 33 percent;
•the
effective tax rate for the proceeds received related to the vitamin antitrust litigation matter of approximately 34 percent (refer to Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements); and
•the
effective tax rate for the charge related to a Latin American equity method investee of approximately 3 percent. 


        Based
on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2006 is expected to be approximately 24 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that
may affect our tax rate in future years. 


Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position  

        We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We expect cash flows from operating activities to
be strong in 2006 and in future years. For the five-year period from 2006 through 2010, we currently estimate that cumulative net cash provided by operating activities will be at least
$30 billion. Accordingly, our Company expects to meet all of our financial commitments and operating needs during this time frame. We expect to use cash generated from operating activities
primarily for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and aggregate contractual obligations. 

53




 



 Cash Flows from Operating Activities  



        Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $6.4 billion, $6.0 billion
and $5.5 billion, respectively. 

        Cash
flows from operating activities increased by 8 percent for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was primarily related to an increase in cash receipts from customers, which was
driven by a 6 percent growth in net operating revenues. These higher cash collections were offset by increased payments to suppliers and vendors, including payments related to our increased
marketing spending. Our cash flows from operating activities in 2005 also improved versus 2004 as a result of a $137 million reduction in payments related to our 2003 streamlining initiatives.
Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows from operating activities in the current year were unfavorably impacted by a $176 million increase in income
tax payments primarily related to payment of a portion of the tax provision associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act. 

        Cash
flows from operating activities increased by 9 percent for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily related to an increase in cash receipts from customers, which was
driven by a 4 percent growth in net operating revenues. Our cash flows from operating activities in 2004 also improved versus 2003 due to a $62 million reduction in payments related to
our 2003 streamlining initiatives. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows from operating activities in 2004 were unfavorably impacted by a
$175 million increase in income tax payments.

        Acquisitions and investments represented the next most significant investing activity, accounting for $637 million in 2005,
$267 million in 2004 and $359 million in 2003. 

        On
April 20, 2005, our Company and Coca-Cola HBC jointly acquired Multon for a total purchase price of approximately $501 million, split equally between the
Company and Coca-Cola HBC. During the third quarter of 2005, our Company acquired the German soft drink bottling company Bremer for approximately $160 million from InBev SA. Also in
2005, the Company acquired Sucos Mais, a Brazilian juice company, and completed the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent interest in the business of CCDA Waters L.L.C. ("CCDA") not
previously owned by our Company. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        In
2004, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment of approximately $341 million related primarily to the sale of production assets in Japan. Refer to Note 2

        In
2003, our single largest acquisition requiring the use of cash was the purchase of a 100 percent ownership interest in Truesdale Packaging Company LLC ("Truesdale") from our
equity method investee CCE for approximately $58 million. Truesdale owns a noncarbonated beverage production facility. In 2003, acquisitions of intangible assets totaled approximately
$142 million. Of this amount, approximately $88 million was related to the Company's acquisition of certain intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and brands in
various parts of the world. None of these trademarks and brands were considered individually significant. Additionally, the Company acquired certain indefinite-lived brands and related definite-lived
contractual rights, with an estimated useful life of 10 years, from Panamco valued at $54 million in the Latin America operating segment. 

        In
July 2003, we made a convertible loan of approximately $133 million to The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt ("TCCBCE") which is included in the line item
purchases of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The loan is convertible into preferred shares of TCCBCE upon receipt of governmental approvals. Additionally,
upon certain defaults under either the loan agreement or the terms of the preferred shares, we have the ability to convert the loan or the preferred shares into common shares. At December 31,
2003, our Company owned approximately 42 percent of the common shares of TCCBCE. The Company consolidated TCCBCE under Interpretation 46(R) effective April 2, 2004. Refer to
Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Debt Financing  



        Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to
lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. 

        As
of December 31, 2005, our long-term debt was rated "A+" by Standard & Poor's and "Aa3" by Moody's, and our commercial paper program was rated
"A-1" and "P-1" by
Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. In assessing our credit strength, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the
aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company and certain bottlers, including CCE and Coca-Cola HBC. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of
these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. If our credit
ratings were reduced by the rating agencies, our interest expense could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's share of equity income could be
reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. 

        We
monitor our interest coverage ratio and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings. However, the rating agencies aggregate financial
data for certain bottlers along with our Company when assessing our debt rating. As such, the key measure to rating agencies is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the Company and certain
bottlers. Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio. These thresholds are not
necessarily permanent, nor are they fully disclosed to our Company. 

        Our
global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with
active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt
management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. 


        Issuances
and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. On December 31, 2005, we had $1,794 million in lines of
credit and other short-term credit facilities available, of which approximately $266 million was outstanding. This entire $266 million related to our international
operations. 

        The
issuances of debt in 2005 primarily included approximately $144 million of issuances of commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or more. The payments of debt
primarily included approximately $1,037 million related to net repayments of commercial paper with maturities of less than 90 days, repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater
than 90 days of approximately $32 million and repayment of approximately $1,363 million of long-term debt. 

        The
issuances of debt in 2004 primarily included approximately $2,109 million of net issuances of commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or less, and approximately
$818 million of issuances of commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days. The payments of debt in 2004 primarily included approximately $927 million related to
commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days and $367 million of long-term debt. 

        The
issuances of debt in 2003 primarily included approximately $304 million of net issuances of commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or less, and approximately
$715 million of issuances of commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days. The payments of debt in 2003 primarily included approximately $907 million related to
commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days and $150 million of long-term debt.

 Share Repurchases  



        In October 1996, our Board of Directors authorized the 1996 Plan to repurchase up to 206 million shares of our Company's common stock through 2006.
The table below presents shares repurchased and average price per share under the 1996 Plan:

        Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2005, we have purchased
more than 1.1 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $16.24. This represents approximately 36 percent of the shares outstanding as of
January 1, 1984. 

        During
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company repurchased common stock under the 1996 Plan. As strong cash flows are expected to continue in the future, the Company currently expects 2006
share repurchases to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. 



 Dividends  



        At its February 2006 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 11 percent, raising it to $0.31 per share, equivalent to a
full-year dividend of $1.24 per share in 2006. This is our 44th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.12 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.88
per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 dividend represented a 12 percent increase from 2004, and the 2004 dividend represented a 14 percent increase from 2003. 



 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  



        In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements: 



•any
obligation under certain guarantee contracts;
•a
retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
entity for such assets;
•any
obligation under certain derivative instruments; and
•any
obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. 


        The
following discusses certain obligations and arrangements involving our Company. 

        On
December 31, 2005, our Company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately $248 million. Management
concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our Company is not probable. As of December 31, 2005, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity,
and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. 

        Our
Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        In
December 2003, we granted a $250 million standby line of credit to Coca-Cola FEMSA with normal market terms. As of December 31, 2005, no amounts have
been drawn against this line of credit. This standby line of credit expires in December 2006.

1
Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of commercial paper borrowings, we typically issue new commercial paper borrowings.
Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.



2

Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of
commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt.



3

We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we estimated interest
rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term
borrowings.



4

We expect to fund these marketing and other commitments with cash flows from operating activities. We have excluded expected payments for marketing programs that are generally determined and committed to on an annual basis.



5

The purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. We expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from
operating activities.



6

The amount represents the estimated cash to be paid to CCEAG shareowners. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the present value of our liability to CCEAG shareowners. We will consider several alternatives
to settle this liability, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt.



7

Other contractual obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable leasing arrangements, with an initial term in excess of one year.





        In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2005, was $1,221 million. Refer to
Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This accrued liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities. This amount is impacted by, among other
items, funding levels, changes in plan 

58




 


demographics
and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual
obligations table. 

        We
fund our U.S. qualified pension plans in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and in accordance
with Internal Revenue Service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. The minimum required contribution for our primary qualified U.S. pension plan for the 2006 plan year is $0 and
is anticipated to remain $0 for at least the next several years due to contributions made to the plan between 2001 and 2005. Therefore, we did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in
the above table. We do, however, anticipate contributing up to the maximum deductible amount to the primary U.S. qualified pension plan in 2006, which is estimated to be approximately
$60 million. Furthermore, we expect to contribute up to $9 million to the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plan during 2006. We generally expect to fund all future contributions
with cash flows from operating activities. 

        Our
international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. We do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in 2006 or thereafter.
Therefore, no amounts have been included in the table above. 

        As
of December 31, 2005, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $1,626 million, and the fair value of plan assets was
$1,881 million. As of December 31, 2005, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $1,415 million, and the fair value
of all other pension plan assets was $756 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded
due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be
funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Disclosure of amounts in the above table regarding expected benefit payments for our unfunded pension
plans and our other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected for 2011 and thereafter due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans. However, in order to inform the
reader about expected benefit payments for these unfunded plans over the next several years, we anticipate annual benefit payments to be in the range of approximately $50 million to
$60 million in 2006 and remain at or near this annual level for the next several years. 

        Deferred
income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2005, were $511 million. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not
included in the total contractual obligations table
because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be
paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. 

        Minority
interests of $151 million as of December 31, 2005, for consolidated entities in which we do not have a 100 percent ownership interest were recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities. Such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources; therefore, this amount is excluded from the
contractual obligations table. 



 Foreign Exchange  



        Our international operations are subject to opportunities and risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations. We closely monitor our operations in each country
and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

59




 

        We
use 46 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weaknesses in some of these currencies might be offset by strengths in others. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the weighted-average
exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as
follows:

        These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in
exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rates on net income and earnings per share. The
total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was an increase of approximately 4 percent, 8 percent and 2 percent in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. In 2006, the Company expects a negative impact on operating income from currencies. 


        Exchange
losses—net amounted to approximately $23 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $76 million in 2003 and were recorded in other
loss—net in our consolidated statements of income. Exchange losses—net include the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional
currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        The
Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. 



 Overview of Financial Position  



        Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004, was impacted by the
following: 



•The
decrease in loans and notes payable of $13 million was primarily due to the decrease of commercial paper borrowings during 2005 of $924 million and was
offset by the reclassification of the payment to be made to CCEAG shareholders from other liabilities to loans and notes payable. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•The
increase in our equity method investments in 2005 of $665 million was primarily due to the payment of approximately $250 million for our share of the joint
acquisition of Multon. The increase also includes the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the U.S. dollar and equity income, net of dividends. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
•The
overall decrease in total assets of $2,014 million as of December 31, 2005, compared to December 31, 2004, was primarily related to the decrease in
cash and cash equivalents, which impacted the Corporate operating segment. The decrease was also due to impairment charges primarily for trademarks amounting to approximately $85 million. The
decrease was partially offset by the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the U.S. dollar, especially a stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso (which impacted the Latin America
operating segment) and a stronger euro (which 

60




 



impacted
the European Union operating segment). Refer to the heading "Operations Review—Other Operating Charges" for a discussion of the impairment charges. 





 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices  



        Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the
majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. 


Additional Information  

        In the first quarter of 2006, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure primarily to establish a new, separate internal organization for its
consolidated bottling operations and its unconsolidated bottling investments. This new structure will result in the reporting of a separate operating segment, along with the six existing geographic
operating segments and Corporate, beginning with the first quarter of 2006. 

        For
additional information concerning our operating segments as of December 31, 2005, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        

        Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser
extent, adverse fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all our
derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the
value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward,
over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. 



 Foreign Exchange  



        We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In
2005, we generated approximately 71 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside of our North America operating group; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be
offset by strengths in others over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. 

        Our
Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and
liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations. 



 Interest Rates  



        We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as our mix of term debt versus non-term debt. From time to
time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. 



 Value-at-Risk  



        We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including value-at-risk models. Our
value-at-risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could
occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates. We have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our
calculations. We examined historical weekly returns over the previous 10 years to calculate our value-at-risk. The average value-at-risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over
the past year. As a result of our foreign currency value-at-risk calculations, we estimate with 95 percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency
derivatives and other financial instruments, over a one-week period, would decline by less than $9 million, $17 million and $26 million, respectively, using 2005, 2004
or 2003 average fair values, and by less than $9 million and $18 million, respectively, using December 31, 2005 and 2004 fair values. According to our interest rate
value-at-risk calculations, we estimate with 95 percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our 2005 average or in our
December 31, 2005, interest rates over a one-week period would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our December 31, 2004 and 2003 estimates
also were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Description of Business  

        The Coca-Cola Company is predominantly a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups. We also manufacture,
distribute and market some finished beverages. In these notes, the terms "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean The Coca-Cola Company and all subsidiaries included in the consolidated
financial statements. Operating in more than 200 countries worldwide, we primarily sell our concentrates and syrups, as well as some finished beverages, to bottling and canning operations,
distributors, fountain wholesalers and fountain retailers. We also market and distribute juice and juice drinks, sports drinks, water products, teas, coffees and other beverage products. Additionally,
we have ownership interests in numerous bottling and canning operations. Significant markets for our products exist in all the world's geographic regions. 


Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  

        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our Company consolidates all
entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Refer to the heading "Variable Interest
Entities," below, for a discussion of variable interest entities. 

        We
use the equity method to account for our investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Consolidated net income
includes our Company's share of the net income of these companies. 

        We
use the cost method to account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate. 

        We
eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with variable interest entities and the intercompany portion of
transactions with equity method investees. 

        Certain
amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. 

Variable Interest Entities  

        In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities" ("Interpretation 46(R)"). Application of this interpretation was required in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, for
interests in variable interest entities that were considered to be special-purpose entities. Our Company determined that we did not have any arrangements or relationships with special-purpose
entities. Application of Interpretation 46(R) for all other types of variable interest entities was required for our Company effective April 2, 2004. 

        Interpretation
46(R) addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition (ownership of a majority voting interest) of consolidation does not apply. This
interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. It concludes that in the absence of clear control through
voting interests, a company's exposure (variable interest) to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity's assets and activities is the best 

68




 


evidence
of control. If an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity, it would be considered the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary is generally
required to include assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. 

        In
our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003, and prior to December 31, 2003, we consolidated all entities that we controlled by ownership of a majority
of voting interests. As a result of Interpretation 46(R), effective as of April 2, 2004, our consolidated balance sheets include the assets and liabilities of: 



•all
entities in which the Company has ownership of a majority of voting interests; and, additionally,
•all
variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. 


        Our
Company holds interests in certain entities, primarily bottlers, previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are considered variable interest entities. These
variable interests relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support for these entities. Upon adoption of Interpretation 46(R) as of April 2, 2004, we consolidated assets of
approximately $383 million and liabilities of approximately $383 million that were previously not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We did not record a cumulative effect of an
accounting change, and prior periods were not restated. The results of operations of these variable interest entities were included in our consolidated results beginning April 3, 2004, and did
not have a material impact for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our Company's investment, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these variable interest entities totaled approximately
$263 million and $313 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. Any creditors of the variable interest entities do not have
recourse against the general credit of the Company as a result of including these variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions  

        The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of
current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. 


Risks and Uncertainties  

        Factors that could adversely impact the Company's operations or financial results include, but are not limited to, the following: obesity concerns; water scarcity
and quality; changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment; increased competition; an inability to enter or expand in developing and emerging markets; fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange and interest rates; the ability to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners; a deterioration in our bottling partners' financial condition; strikes or work stoppages (including
at key manufacturing locations); increased cost of energy; increased cost, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials; changes in laws and regulations relating to our business, including those
regarding beverage containers and packaging; additional labeling or warning requirements; unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets; changes in commercial and market
practices within the European Economic Area; litigation or legal proceedings; adverse weather conditions; an inability to maintain brand image and product issues such as product recalls; changes in
the legal and regulatory environment in various countries 

69




 


in
which we operate; changes in accounting and taxation standards including an increase in tax rates; an inability to achieve our overall long-term goals; an inability to protect our information
systems; future impairment charges; and global or regional catastrophic events. 

        Our
Company monitors our operations with a view to minimizing the impact to our overall business that could arise as a result of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. 

Revenue Recognition  

        Our Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For
our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. In particular, title usually transfers
upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. 

        In
addition, our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs (refer to the
heading "Other Assets"). The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure initiatives, was approximately
$3.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

Advertising Costs  

        Our Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. Advertising costs
included in selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.5 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, advertising and production costs of approximately $170 million and $171 million, respectively, were recorded in prepaid
expenses and other assets and in noncurrent other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

        Our Company currently sponsors stock option plans and restricted stock award plans. Effective January 1, 2002, our Company adopted the preferable fair
value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The fair values of the stock awards are determined using
a single estimated expected life. The compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Refer to Note 14. 

Issuances of Stock by Equity Method Investees  

        When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee decreases. In the event the
issuance price per share is higher or lower than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance. This noncash gain or loss, net of any deferred taxes, is
generally recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs. 

70




 


        If
gains have been previously recognized on issuances of an equity method investee's stock and shares of the equity method investee are subsequently repurchased by the equity method
investee, gain recognition does not occur on issuances subsequent to the date of a repurchase until shares have been issued in an amount equivalent to the number of repurchased shares. This type of
transaction is reflected as an equity transaction, and the net effect is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3. 

Income Taxes  

        Income tax expense includes United States, state, local and international income taxes, plus a provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax
basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. Refer to Note 16. 

Net Income Per Share  

        Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net
income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately
180 million, 151 million and 145 million stock option awards were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, because the
awards would have been antidilutive for the periods presented. 

Cash Equivalents  

        We classify marketable securities that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents. We manage our
exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our credit risk concentrations. 


Trade Accounts Receivable  

        We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss
anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, level of past
due-accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with and economic status of our bottling partners and customers. 

        A
significant portion of our net revenues is derived from sales of our products in international markets. Refer to Note 20. We also generate a significant portion of our net
revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to bottlers in which we have a noncontrolling interest, including Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ("CCE"), Coca-Cola Hellenic
Bottling Company S.A. ("Coca-Cola HBC"), Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA") and Coca-Cola Amatil Limited ("Coca-Cola
Amatil"). Refer to Note 2. 

71




 



Inventories  

        Inventories consist primarily of raw materials, supplies, concentrates and syrups and are valued at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on the basis of
average cost or first-in, first-out methods. 

Recoverability of Equity Method and Cost Method Investments  

        Management periodically assesses the recoverability of our Company's equity method and cost method investments. For publicly traded investments, readily available
quoted market prices are an indication of the fair value of our Company's investments. For nonpublicly traded investments, if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an impairment
evaluation, management assesses fair value based on valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the
assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds valuation
methodologies. If an investment is considered to be impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary, we record a write-down. 

Other Assets  

        Our Company advances payments to certain customers for marketing to fund future activities intended to generate profitable volume, and we expense such payments
over the applicable period. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Additionally, our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are
directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, management evaluates
the recoverability of these assets by preparing estimates of sales volume, the resulting gross profit and cash flows. Costs of these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and
noncurrent other assets and are being amortized over the remaining periods to be directly benefited, which range from 1 to 13 years. Amortization expense for infrastructure programs was
approximately $134 million, $136 million and $153 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Refer to heading "Revenue Recognition," above,
and Note 2. 

Property, Plant and Equipment  

        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which generally have the following ranges: buildings and
improvements: 40 years or less; machinery and equipment: 15 years or less; containers: 10 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated
until ready for service and capitalized. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of
the improvement. Depreciation expense totaled approximately $752 million, $715 million and $667 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled approximately $17 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Refer to Note 4. 

        Management
assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
assets may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market value of the assets or a significant change in the business conditions in a particular market. If we determine that the carrying
value of an asset is not recoverable based on expected 

72




 

undiscounted
future cash flows, excluding interest charges, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. 


Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets  

        In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," we classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets
with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We do not amortize intangible assets with
indefinite lives and goodwill. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an
economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, we perform tests for impairment at least annually
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Such tests for impairment are also required for intangible assets and/or goodwill recorded by our equity method
investees. All goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which are one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each
business combination. We perform our impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
value, including goodwill. We record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair values are derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of
scenarios, where applicable, that are weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. When appropriate, we consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would
use in estimating future cash flows. In addition, where applicable, an appropriate discount rate is used, based on the Company's cost of capital rate or location-specific economic factors. In case the
fair value is less than the carrying value of the assets, we record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges are generally recorded in
the line item other operating charges or equity income—net in the consolidated statements of income. 

        Our
Company determines the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider
when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local
regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and, other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives
are amortized, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, ranging from 1 to 48 years. Refer to Note 5. 

Derivative Financial Instruments  

        Our Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
as amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133—an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 133," SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS
No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated
balance sheets, with fair values of foreign currency derivatives estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 11. 

73




 


Retirement-Related Benefits  

        Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, our Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions." We account for our nonpension postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." In
2003, we adopted SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," ("SFAS No. 132(R)") for all U.S. plans. As permitted by this
standard, in 2004, we adopted the disclosure provisions for all foreign plans. SFAS No. 132(R) requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit
cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. This statement did not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, SFAS
No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," or SFAS No. 106. Refer to Note 15 for a description
of how we determine our principal assumptions for pension and postretirement benefit accounting. 

Contingencies  

        Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties
including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability
and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 12. 

Business Combinations  

        In accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," we account for all business combinations by the purchase method. Furthermore, we recognize
intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or legal rights or if they are separable from goodwill. 


Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements  

        In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the
change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 became effective for our Company on January 1, 2006. We believe that the adoption of SFAS
No. 154 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


        In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." SFAS No. 153 is based on the principle
that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," provided an exception to
its basic measurement principle (fair value) for exchanges of similar productive assets. Under APB Opinion No. 29, an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset was based on
the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. SFAS No. 153 eliminates this exception and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. SFAS No. 153 became effective for our Company as of July 2, 2005, and did not have a material impact on our 

74




 


consolidated
financial statements. The Company will continue to apply the requirements of SFAS No. 153 on any future nonmonetary exchange transactions. 

        In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes APB Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach
described in SFAS No. 123. In 2005, our Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees. Our Company adopted SFAS
No. 123(R), using
the modified-prospective method, beginning January 1, 2006. Based on the terms of our plans, our Company did not have a cumulative effect related to its plans. We do not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) to have a material impact on our Company's future stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, our equity method investees are also required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R)
no later than January 1, 2006. Our proportionate share of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees will be
recognized as a reduction to equity income. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

        During
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare known as Medicare Part D. The Act also established a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D. During the second quarter of 2004, our Company adopted the provisions of FSP 106-2 retroactive to January 1, 2004. The adoption of FSP
106-2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 15. 

        In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 requires that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) be recorded as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company adopted SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS
No. 151 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Creation Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act includes a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals
to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. Such repatriations must occur in either an enterprise's last tax year that began before the enactment date, or
the first tax year that begins during the one-year period beginning on the date of enactment. 


        Issued
in December 2004, FASB Staff Position 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"), indicated that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the Jobs Creation Act and the timing of the enactment necessitated a practical
exception to the SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law. Accordingly, enterprises were allowed time beyond
2004 to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Creation Act on their plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, in 2005, the Company
repatriated $6.1 billion of its previously unremitted earnings and recorded an associated tax expense of approximately $315 million. Refer to Note 16.

        In 2004, our Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of the realization of certain tax credits related to certain
provisions of the Jobs Creation Act not related to repatriation provisions. Refer to Note 16. 


        Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an
exit or disposal plan be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under SFAS No. 146, an exit or disposal plan exists when the following criteria are met: 



•Management,
having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination.
•The
plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations, and the expected completion date.
•The
plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement, including the benefits that employees will receive upon termination (including but not limited to cash payments),
in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated.
•Actions
required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 


        SFAS
No. 146 establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. In cases where employees are required to render service beyond a minimum
retention period until they are terminated in order to receive termination benefits, a liability for termination benefits is recognized ratably over the future service period. Under the previous rule,
EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for the entire amount of the exit cost was recognized at the date that the entity met the four criteria described above. Refer to Note 18. 


        Effective
January 1, 2003, our Company adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("Interpretation 45"). This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual
financial statements about the obligations under certain guarantees. Interpretation 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not currently provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. As a result, this interpretation has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS  


Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  

        CCE is a marketer, producer and distributor of bottle and can nonalcoholic beverages, operating in eight countries. On December 31, 2005, our Company owned
approximately 36 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. We account for our investment by the equity method of accounting and, therefore, our operating results include our proportionate
share of income resulting from our investment in CCE. As of December 31, 2005, our proportionate share of the net assets of CCE exceeded our investment by approximately $281 million.
This difference is not amortized.

payments
made by us directly to CCE represent support of certain marketing activities and our participation with CCE in cooperative advertising and other marketing activities to promote the sale of
Company trademark products within CCE territories. These programs are agreed to on an annual basis. Marketing payments made to third parties on behalf of CCE represent support of certain marketing
activities and programs to promote the sale of Company trademark products within CCE's territories in conjunction with certain of CCE's customers. Pursuant to cooperative advertising and trade
agreements with CCE, we received funds from CCE for local media and marketing program reimbursements. Payments made to CCE for dispensing equipment repair services represent reimbursement to CCE for
its costs of parts and labor for repairs on cooler, dispensing, or post-mix equipment owned by us or our customers. 

        In
2005, our equity income related to CCE decreased by approximately $33 million as compared to 2004, related to our proportionate share of certain charges and gains recorded by
CCE. Our proportionate share of CCE's charges included an approximate $51 million decrease to equity income, primarily related to the tax liability recorded by CCE in the fourth quarter of 2005
resulting from the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act and approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE. These
restructuring charges were primarily related to workforce reductions associated with the reorganization of CCE's North American operations, changes in executive management and elimination of certain
positions in CCE's corporate headquarters. These charges were partially offset by an approximate $37 million increase to equity income in the second quarter of 2005 resulting from CCE's high
fructose corn syrup ("HFCS") lawsuit settlement proceeds and changes in certain of CCE's state and provincial tax rates. Refer to Note 17. 


        In
the second quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to terminate the Sales Growth Initiative ("SGI") agreement and certain other marketing funding programs that were previously in
place. Due to termination of these agreements, a significant portion of the cash payments to be made by us directly to CCE was eliminated prospectively. At the termination of these agreements, we
agreed that the concentrate price that CCE pays us for sales made in the United States and Canada would be reduced. Total cash support paid by our Company under the SGI agreement prior to its
termination was approximately $58 million and approximately $161 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are included in the line item marketing payments made by us
directly to CCE in the table above. 

        In
the second quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to establish a Global Marketing Fund, under which we expect to pay CCE $62 million annually through December 31,
2014, as support for certain marketing activities. The term of the agreement will automatically be extended for successive 10-year periods thereafter unless either party gives written
notice of termination of this agreement. The marketing activities to be funded under this agreement will be agreed upon each year as part of the annual joint planning process and will be incorporated
into the annual marketing plans of both companies. We paid CCE $62 million in 2005 and a pro rata amount of $42 million for 2004. These amounts are included in the line item marketing
payments made by us directly to CCE in the table above. 

78




 

        Our
Company previously entered into programs with CCE designed to help develop cold-drink infrastructure. Under these programs, our Company paid CCE for a portion of the cost
of developing the infrastructure necessary to support accelerated placements of cold-drink equipment. These payments support a common objective of increased sales of Company trademarked
beverages from increased availability and consumption in the cold-drink channel. In connection with these programs, CCE agreed to: 



(1)purchase
and place specified numbers of Company-approved cold-drink equipment each year through 2010;
(2)maintain
the equipment in service, with certain exceptions, for a period of at least 12 years after placement;
(3)maintain
and stock the equipment in accordance with specified standards; and
(4)annual
reporting to our Company of minimum average annual unit case volume throughout the economic life of the equipment and other specified information. 



        CCE
must achieve minimum average unit case volume for a 12-year period following the placement of equipment. These minimum average unit case volume levels ensure adequate
gross profit from sales of concentrate to fully recover the capitalized costs plus a return on the Company's investment. Should CCE fail to purchase the specified numbers of cold-drink
equipment for any calendar year through 2010, the parties agreed to mutually develop a reasonable solution. Should no mutually agreeable solution be developed, or in the event that CCE otherwise
breaches any material obligation under the contracts and such breach is not remedied within a stated period, then CCE would be required to repay a portion of the support funding as determined by our
Company. In the third quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract to defer the placement of some equipment from 2004 and 2005, as previously agreed under the original contract,
to 2009 and 2010. In connection with this amendment, CCE agreed to pay the Company approximately $2 million in 2004, $3 million annually in 2005 through 2008, and $1 million in
2009. In 2005, our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract for North America to move to a system of purchase and placement credits, whereby CCE earns credit toward its annual purchase and
placement requirements based upon the type of equipment it purchases and places. The amended contract also provides that no breach by CCE will occur even if they do not achieve the required number of
purchase and placement credits in any given year, so long as (1) the shortfall does not exceed 20 percent of the required purchase and placement credits for that year; (2) a
compensating payment is made to our Company by CCE; (3) the shortfall is corrected in the following year; and (4) CCE meets all specified purchase and placement credit requirements by
the end of 2010. The payments we made to CCE under these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and in noncurrent other assets and amortized as deductions from revenues over the
10-year period following the placement of the equipment. Our carrying values for these infrastructure programs with CCE were approximately $662 million and $759 million as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has no further commitments under these programs. 


        In
March 2004, the Company and CCE launched the Dasani water brand in Great Britain. The product was voluntarily recalled. During 2004, our Company reimbursed CCE
$32 million for product recall costs incurred by CCE. 

        In
March 2003, our Company acquired a 100 percent ownership interest in Truesdale Packaging Company LLC ("Truesdale") from CCE. Refer to Note 19. 

79




 


        If
valued at the December 31, 2005 quoted closing price of CCE shares, the fair value of our investment in CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately
$1.5 billion. 

Other Equity Method Investments  

        Our other equity method investments include our ownership interests in Coca-Cola HBC, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Amatil for which we own 24 percent,
40 percent and 32 percent of their common shares, respectively. 


        Operating
results include our proportionate share of income (loss) from our equity method investments. A summary of financial information for our equity method investments in the

        Net sales to equity method investees other than CCE, the majority of which are located outside the United States, were approximately
$7.4 billion in 2005, $5.2 billion in 2004 and $4.0 billion in 2003. Total support payments, primarily marketing, made to equity method investees other than CCE were approximately
$475 million, $442 million and $511 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

        Our
Company owns a 50 percent interest in Multon, a Russian juice business ("Multon"), which we acquired in April 2005 jointly with Coca-Cola HBC, for a total
purchase price of approximately $501 million, split equally between the Company and Coca-Cola HBC. Multon produces and distributes juice products under the DOBRIY, Rich, Nico and other
trademarks in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Equity income—net includes our proportionate share of Multon's net income beginning April 20, 2005. Refer to Note 19. 

80




 


        During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company's equity income benefited by approximately $37 million for its share of a favorable tax settlement related to Coca-Cola
FEMSA. 

        In
December 2004, the Company sold to an unrelated financial institution certain of its production assets that were previously leased to the Japanese supply chain management
company (refer to discussion below). The assets were sold for approximately $271 million, and the sale resulted in no gain or loss. The financial institution entered into a leasing arrangement
with the Japanese supply chain management company. These assets were previously reported in our consolidated balance sheet line item property, plant and equipment—net and assigned to our
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment. 

        During
2004, our Company sold our bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal to Coca-Cola Sabco (Pty) Ltd. ("Sabco") for a total consideration of
$29 million. In addition, Sabco assumed certain debts of these bottling operations. The proceeds from the sale of these bottlers were approximately equal to the carrying value of the
investment. 

        Effective
May 6, 2003, one of our Company's equity method investees, Coca-Cola FEMSA, consummated a merger with another of the Company's equity method investees,
Panamerican Beverages, Inc. ("Panamco"). Our Company received new Coca-Cola FEMSA shares in exchange for all Panamco shares previously held by the Company. Our Company's ownership
interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA increased from 30 percent to approximately 40 percent as a result of this merger. This exchange of shares was treated as a nonmonetary exchange of
similar productive assets, and no gain was recorded by our Company as a result of this merger. 


        In
connection with the merger, Coca-Cola FEMSA management initiated steps to streamline and integrate operations. This process included the closing of various distribution
centers and manufacturing plants. Furthermore, due to the challenging economic conditions and an uncertain political situation in Venezuela, certain intangible assets were determined to be impaired
and written down to their fair market value. During 2003, our Company recorded a noncash pretax charge of $102 million primarily related to our proportionate share of these matters. This charge
is included in the consolidated statement of income line item equity income—net. 

        In
December 2003, the Company issued a standby line of credit to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Refer to Note 12. 


        The
Company and the major shareowner of Coca-Cola FEMSA have an understanding that will permit this shareowner to purchase from our Company an amount of Coca-Cola
FEMSA shares sufficient for this shareowner to regain a 51 percent ownership interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA. Pursuant to this understanding, which is in place until May 2006,
this shareowner would pay the higher of the prevailing market price per share at the time of the sale or the sum of approximately $2.22 per share plus the Company's carrying costs. Both resulting
amounts are in excess of our Company's carrying value. 

        In
July 2003, we made a convertible loan of approximately $133 million to The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt ("TCCBCE"). The loan is convertible into
preferred shares of TCCBCE upon receipt of governmental approvals. Additionally, upon certain defaults under either the loan agreement or the terms of the preferred shares, we have the ability to
convert the loan or the preferred shares into common shares. As of December 31, 2005, our Company owned approximately 42 percent of the common shares of TCCBCE. Since the adoption of
Interpretation 46(R) in 2004, TCCBCE has been consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. 

81




 


        Effective
October 1, 2003, the Company and all of its bottling partners in Japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement,
production and logistics operations for the entire Coca-Cola system in Japan. As a result of the creation of this supply chain management company in Japan, a portion of our Company's
business was essentially converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model, thus reducing our net operating revenues and cost of goods sold by the same amounts. The
formation of this entity included the sale of Company inventory and leasing of certain Company assets to this new entity on October 1, 2003, as well as our recording of a liability for certain
contractual obligations to Japanese bottlers. Such amounts were not material to the Company's results of operations. 


        In
November 2003, Coca-Cola HBC approved a share capital reduction totaling approximately 473 million euros and the return of 2 euros per share to all
shareowners. In December 2003, our Company received our share capital return payment from Coca-Cola HBC equivalent to $136 million, and we recorded a reduction to our
investment in Coca-Cola HBC. 

        If
valued at the December 31, 2005 quoted closing prices of shares actively traded on stock markets, the value of our equity method investments in publicly traded bottlers other
than CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately $2.4 billion. 


Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees  

        The total amount of net receivables due from equity method investees, including CCE, was approximately $644 million and $573 million as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total amount of dividends received from equity method investees, including CCE, was approximately $234 million, $145 million and
$112 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

NOTE 3: ISSUANCES OF STOCK BY EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES  

        In 2005, our Company recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by equity method investees. We recorded deferred
taxes of approximately $8 million on these gains. These gains primarily related to an issuance of common stock by Coca-Cola Amatil, which was valued at an amount greater than the
book value per share of our investment in Coca-Cola Amatil. Coca-Cola Amatil issued approximately 34 million shares of common stock with a fair value of $5.78 each in
connection with the acquisition of SPC Ardmona Pty. Ltd., an Australian packaged fruit company. This issuance of common stock reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of
Coca-Cola Amatil from approximately 34.0 percent to approximately 32.4 percent. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by CCE. The issuances primarily related to the exercise of CCE stock options
by CCE employees at amounts greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. We recorded deferred taxes of approximately $9 million on these gains. These issuances of stock
reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE from approximately 37.2 percent to approximately 36.0 percent. 

        In
2003, our Company recorded approximately $8 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by equity method investees. These gains primarily related to the issuance by
CCE of common stock valued at an amount greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. These transactions reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE from
approximately 37.3 percent to approximately 37.2 percent.

The decrease in 2005 was primarily the result of impairment charges of approximately $84 million related to trademarks in the Philippines and the effect of translation adjustments, partially offset by acquisitions of
trademarks and brands in 2005 totaling approximately $22 million, none of which were individually significant. Refer to Note 17.

The decrease in 2005 was primarily the result of translation adjustments, partially offset by goodwill recognized in connection with the Bremer acquisition. Refer to Note 19.

The increase in 2005 was primarily related to the Bremer and Sucos Mais acquisitions. Refer to Note 19.





        Total
amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was approximately $29 million, $35 million and $23 million for the years ended

        In 2005, our Company recorded an impairment charge related to trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines of approximately
$84 million. The Philippines is a component of our East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. The carrying value of our trademarks in the Philippines, prior to the recording of the
impairment charges in 2005, was approximately $268 million. The impairment was the result of our revised outlook of the Philippines, which has been unfavorably impacted by declines in volume
and income before income taxes resulting from the continued lack of an affordable package offering and the continued limited availability of these trademark beverages in the marketplace. We determined
the amount of this impairment charge by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the carrying value. Fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios
that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets, we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value
of the assets to fair value. This impairment charge was recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of income. 

        In
2004, acquisition of intangible assets totaled approximately $89 million. This amount is primarily related to the Company's acquisition of trademarks with indefinite lives in
the Latin America operating segment. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded impairment charges related to intangible assets of approximately $374 million. The decrease in bottlers' franchise rights in 2004 was primarily due
to this impairment charge, offset by an increase due to translation adjustment. These impairment charges primarily were in the European Union operating segment and were included in other operating
charges in our consolidated statement of income. The charges were primarily related to franchise rights at Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetraenke AG ("CCEAG"). The impairment was the result of our revised
outlook for the German market, which has been unfavorably impacted by volume declines resulting from market shifts related to the deposit law on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding
lack of availability for our products in the discount retail channel. The 

84




 


deposit
laws in Germany led to discount chains creating proprietary packages that could only be returned to their own stores. These proprietary packages were continuing to gain market share and
customer acceptance. 

        At
the end of 2004, the German government passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that requires retailers, including discount chains, to accept returns of each type of
nonrefillable beverage containers that retailers sell, regardless of where the beverage package type was purchased. In addition, the mandatory deposit requirement was expanded to other beverage
categories. The amendment allows for a transition period to enable manufacturers and retailers to establish a national take-back system for nonrefillable packages. The transition period is
expected to last at least until mid-2006. In the second half of 2005, the Company was able to gain limited availability of our products in the discount retail channel.

NOTE 7: SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  

       Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States and a liability to acquire the remaining approximate 59 percent
of CCEAG's outstanding stock. The Company currently owns 41 percent of CCEAG's outstanding stock. In February 2002, the Company acquired control of CCEAG and agreed to put/call agreements with
the other shareowners of CCEAG, which resulted in the recording of a liability to acquire the remaining shares in CCEAG no later than December 31, 2006. The present value of the total amount
likely to be paid by our Company to all other CCEAG shareowners was approximately $941 million at December 31, 2005, and approximately $1,041 million at December 31, 2004.
This amount increased from the initial liability of approximately $600 million due to the accretion of the discounted value to the ultimate maturity of the liability, as well as approximately
$222 million of translation adjustment related to this liability. The accretion of the discounted value to its ultimate maturity value is recorded in the line item other loss—net,
and this amount was approximately $60 million, $58 million and $51 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 

        As
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $3,311 million and $4,235 million, respectively, outstanding in commercial paper borrowings. Our
weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were approximately 4.2 percent and 2.2 percent per year at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition,
we had $1,794 million in lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities available as of December 31, 2005, of which approximately $266 million was outstanding.
This entire outstanding amount of approximately $266 million related to our international operations. Included in the available credit facilities 

85




 


discussed
above, the Company had $1,150 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup. There were no borrowings under these lines of credit during
2005. 

        These
credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to
our Company.

        After
giving effect to interest rate management instruments, the principal amount of our long-term debt that had fixed and variable interest rates, respectively, was
$1,181 million and $1 million on December 31, 2005. After giving effect to interest rate management instruments, the principal amount of our long-term debt that had fixed and
variable interest rates, respectively, was $1,895 million and $752 million on December 31, 2004. Including the effect of interest rate management instruments, the weighted-average
interest rate on the outstanding balances of our Company's long-term debt was 6.0 percent and 4.4 percent per year for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

        Total
interest paid was approximately $233 million, $188 million and $180 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For a more detailed discussion of interest

NOTE 10: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Certain Debt and Marketable Equity Securities  

        Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for by the equity method, are categorized as trading,
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. On December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no trading securities. Our marketable equity investments are
categorized as available-for-sale with their cost basis determined by the specific identification method. We record available-for-sale instruments at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of AOCI. Debt securities categorized as held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost. 

        As

        For
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were not material. The cost
of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments  

        The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, non-marketable cost method investments, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and loans and notes
payable approximate their fair values because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments. 


        We
carry our non-marketable cost method investments at cost or, if a decline in the value of the investment is deemed to be other than temporary, at fair value. Estimates of fair value
are generally based upon discounted cash flow analyses. 

89




 


        We
recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, with fair values estimated based on quoted market prices or
pricing models using current market rates. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward, over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. For further discussion of our
derivatives, including a disclosure of derivative values, refer to Note 11. 

        The
fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. As of December 31, 2005, the carrying amounts and fair
values of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were approximately $1,182 million and approximately $1,240 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004,
these carrying amounts and fair values were approximately $2,647 million and approximately $2,736 million, respectively. 


NOTE 11: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

        Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
and, to a lesser extent, in commodity prices and other market risks. When entered into, the Company formally designates and documents the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying
exposure, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. The Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter,
whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Because of the
high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the
fair values or
cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Virtually all of our derivatives
are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. Our Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 

        The
fair values of derivatives used to hedge or modify our risks fluctuate over time. We do not view these fair value amounts in isolation, but rather in relation to the fair values or
cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and,
therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the
derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other financial indices. 

        Our
Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. At the inception of the hedging
relationship, the Company must designate the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. This designation is based upon the exposure
being hedged. 

        We
have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures
daily and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral in the form of U.S. government
securities for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases.
To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative 

90




 


transactions
with a portfolio of financial institutions. The Company has master netting agreements with most of the financial institutions that are counterparties to the derivative instruments. These
agreements allow for the net settlement of assets and liabilities arising from different transactions with the same counterparty. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default
to be minimal. 

Interest Rate Management  

        Our Company monitors our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of term debt versus non-term debt. This monitoring includes a
review of business and other financial risks. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Interest
rate swap agreements that meet certain conditions required under SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges are accounted for as such, with the offset recorded to adjust the fair value of the
underlying exposure being hedged. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, there was no ineffectiveness related to fair value hedges. At December 31, 2005, our Company had no outstanding interest rate swap
agreements. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our Company's interest rate swap agreements was approximately $6 million. The Company estimates the fair value of its interest rate
derivatives based on quoted market prices. 

Foreign Currency Management  

        The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows resulting from sales outside the
United States will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 


        We
enter into forward exchange contracts and purchase foreign currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, are reported in AOCI and reclassified into
earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion (which was not significant in 2005,
2004 or 2003) of the change in fair value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. These contracts had maturities up to one year as of December 31, 2005. 


        Additionally,
the Company enters into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. These instruments are used to offset the
earnings impact relating to the variability in foreign currency exchange rates on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these
instruments are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other loss—net of our consolidated statements of income to offset the effect of remeasurement of the monetary assets and
liabilities. 

        The
Company also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment position in certain major currencies. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these
instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of AOCI, to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $40 million, $8 million and $29 million, respectively, of losses relating to derivative financial instruments were recorded
in foreign currency translation adjustment.

        The Company estimates the fair value of its foreign currency derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market
rates. These amounts are primarily reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Summary of AOCI  

        For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded a net gain (loss) to AOCI of approximately $55 million, $6 million and
$(31) million, respectively, net of both income taxes and reclassifications to earnings, primarily related to gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges. These items will generally offset
cash flow gains and losses relating to the underlying exposures being hedged in future periods. The Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months gains of
approximately $21 million from the after-tax amount recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2005, as the anticipated foreign currency cash flows occur.

        The
Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedge relationships during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 

NOTE 12: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

        As of December 31, 2005, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately
$248 million. These guarantees primarily are related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms,
and none of these guarantees is individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not
consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. 

        In
December 2003, we granted a $250 million standby line of credit to Coca-Cola FEMSA with normal market terms. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, no
amounts have been drawn against this line of credit. This standby line of credit expires in December 2006. 

        We
believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations. 

93




 


        The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate
of possible losses can be made. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, including those discussed below, will not have
a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. 

        In
2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") initiated an investigation into whether the Company, or certain persons associated with the Company, violated federal securities
laws in connection with the conduct alleged by a former employee of the Company. Additionally in 2003, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia commenced a criminal
investigation of the allegations raised by the same former employee. On April 18, 2005, the Company announced that it had reached a settlement ending the SEC's investigation. Pursuant to the
settlement, the Company agreed to maintain certain measures implemented prior to or during the preceding two years and to undertake additional remedial measures in the areas of corporate compliance
and disclosure. The settlement did not require the payment of a fine or other monetary sanction. On April 18, 2005, the Company also announced that it had received notification that the United
States Attorney's Office was terminating its investigation without taking further action. 

        During
the period from 1970 to 1981, our Company owned Aqua-Chem, Inc. ("Aqua-Chem"). A division of Aqua-Chem manufactured certain boilers that
contained gaskets that Aqua-Chem purchased from outside suppliers. Several years after our Company sold this entity, Aqua-Chem received its first lawsuit relating to asbestos,
a component of some of the gaskets. In September 2002, Aqua-Chem notified our Company that it believes we are obligated for certain costs and expenses associated with its asbestos
litigations. Aqua-Chem demanded that our Company reimburse it for approximately $10 million for out-of-pocket litigation-related expenses.
Aqua-Chem has also demanded that the Company acknowledge a continuing obligation to Aqua-Chem for any future liabilities and expenses that are excluded from coverage under the
applicable insurance or for which there is no insurance. Our Company disputes Aqua-Chem's claims, and we believe we have no obligation to Aqua-Chem for any of its past, present
or future liabilities, costs or expenses. Furthermore, we believe we have substantial legal and factual defenses to Aqua-Chem's claims. The parties entered into litigation to resolve this
dispute, which was stayed by agreement of the parties pending the outcome of litigation filed in Wisconsin by certain insurers of Aqua-Chem. In that case, five plaintiff insurance
companies filed a declaratory judgment action against Aqua-Chem, the Company and 16 defendant insurance companies seeking a determination of the parties' rights and liabilities under
policies issued by the insurers and reimbursement for amounts paid by plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. That litigation remains pending, and the Company believes it has substantial legal and
factual defenses to the insurers' claims. Aqua-Chem and the Company subsequently reached a settlement agreement with five of the insurers in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,
and those insurers will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. Aqua-Chem has also reached a settlement agreement with an
additional insurer regarding payment of that insurer's policy proceeds for Aqua-Chem's asbestos claims. Aqua-Chem and the Company will continue to negotiate with the 15 other insurers that are parties
to the Wisconsin insurance coverage case and will litigate their claims against such insurers to the extent negotiations do not result in settlements. The Company also believes Aqua-Chem
has substantial insurance coverage to pay Aqua-Chem's asbestos claimants.

        In
1999, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission (the "Commission") began an investigation of various commercial and market practices of the Company and its bottlers in
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Great Britain. On October 19, 2004, the Company and certain of its bottlers submitted a formal Undertaking to the Commission, and the Commission accepted
the Undertaking, subject to formal review by third parties. Following the comment period, the Commission presented to the Company certain comments it had received from third parties, as well as
certain additional comments of the Commission's legal staff. The Company addressed those additional comments, revised the Undertaking accordingly and submitted the final Undertaking to the Commission.
On June 22, 2005, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) 1/2003. The decision renders legally binding the commitments set forth in the Undertaking
submitted by the Company and certain of its bottlers on October 19, 2004, as such Undertaking was revised following consultations with national competition authorities of European Economic Area
Member States and industry participants. The final Undertaking is substantially similar to the Undertaking initially submitted on October 19, 2004. In light of the commitments, the Commission
declared that there were no further grounds for action on its part and, without prejudice to
Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) 1/2003, that the proceedings in the case should therefore be brought to an end. The Undertaking potentially applies in 27 countries and in all channels of
distribution where the Company's carbonated soft drinks account for over 40 percent of national sales and twice the nearest competitor's share. The commitments the Company made in the
Undertaking relate broadly to exclusivity, percentage-based purchasing commitments, transparency, target rebates, tying, assortment or range commitments, and agreements concerning products of other
suppliers. The Undertaking also applies to shelf space commitments in agreements with take-home customers and to financing and availability agreements in the on-premise
channel. In addition, the Undertaking includes commitments that are applicable to commercial arrangements concerning the installation and use of technical equipment (such as coolers, fountain
equipment and vending machines). The Undertaking does not imply any recognition on the Company's or the bottlers' part of any infringement of European Union competition rules. The Company believes
that the Undertaking, while imposing restrictions, clarifies the application of competition rules to its practices in Europe and will allow the Coca-Cola system to be able to compete
vigorously while adhering to the Undertaking's provisions. 

        The
Spanish Competition Service (the "Service") made unannounced visits to the Company's offices and those of certain of its bottlers in Spain in 2000. In December 2003, the
Service suspended its investigation until the Commission notified the Service how the Commission would proceed in its commercial and market practices investigation referred to above. On
June 22, 2005, the Commission informed the Service that the Commission had adopted the above referenced decision pursuant to Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) 1/2003. On
June 24, 2005, the Company received an Order from the Service, informing us of the Service's proposal to discontinue its investigation and dismiss the proceedings. On July 15,
2005, the Service issued its decision discontinuing its investigation and dismissing the proceedings, and this decision has become final. 

        The
French Competition Directorate (the "Directorate") has also initiated an inquiry into commercial practices related to the soft drink sector in France. This inquiry has been conducted
through visits to the offices of the Company; however, no conclusions have been communicated to the Company by the Directorate. As a result of the Undertaking given by the Company and certain of its
bottlers to the Commission referenced above, the Company believes the investigation has been discontinued. 

        The
Company is discussing with the Commission issues relating to parallel trade within the European Union arising out of comments received by the Commission from third parties. The
Company is cooperating fully with the Commission and is providing information on these issues and the measures taken and to be taken 

95




 


to
address any issues raised. The Company is unable to predict at this time with any reasonable degree of certainty what action, if any, the Commission will take with respect to these issues. 


        At
the time we acquire or divest our interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any
liability to the Company that may arise
as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. 

        The
Company is involved in various tax matters. We establish reserves at the time that we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters
and the amounts of such possible additional taxes are reasonably estimable. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we may have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved or when a tax
assessment is raised. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any
particular tax matter, we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued
income taxes in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Favorable resolution of tax matters that had been previously reserved would be recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense, when
known. 

        The
Company is also involved in various tax matters where we have determined that the probability of an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible. Management believes that any liability
to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending tax matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.

NOTE 14: STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS  

       Effective January 1, 2002, our Company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. In accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123, $324 million, $345 million and $422 million were recorded for total stock-based compensation expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
$324 million and $345 million recorded in 2005 and 2004, respectively, were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Of the $422 million recorded in 2003,
$407 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $15 million was recorded in other operating charges. Refer to Note 18. 

96




 


        During
2005, the Company changed its estimated service period for retirement-eligible participants in its plans when the terms of their stock-based compensation awards provide for
accelerated vesting upon early retirement. The full-year impact of this change in our estimated service period was approximately $50 million for 2005. 


Stock Option Plans  

        Under our 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Option Plan"), a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred to
certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options granted under the 1991 Option Plan. Options to purchase common stock under the 1991 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair
market value at the date of grant. 

        The
1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Option Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 1999. Following the approval of the 1999 Option Plan, no grants were made from the 1991
Option Plan, and shares available under the 1991 Option Plan were no longer available to be granted. Under the 1999 Option Plan, a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved
to be issued or transferred to certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options granted under the 1999 Option Plan. Options to purchase common stock under the 1999 Option Plan have been
granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant. 

        The
2002 Stock Option Plan (the "2002 Option Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 2002. An amendment to the 2002 Option Plan which permitted the issuance of stock
appreciation rights was approved by shareowners in April 2003. Under the 2002 Option Plan, a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred to
certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2002 Option Plan. The stock appreciation rights permit the holder, upon surrendering all or
part of the related stock option, to receive common stock in an amount up to 100 percent of the difference between the market price and the option price. No stock appreciation rights have been
issued under the 2002 Option Plan as of December 31, 2005. Options to purchase common stock under the 2002 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of
grant. 

        Stock
options granted in December 2003 and thereafter generally become exercisable over a four-year annual vesting period and expire 10 years from the date of
grant. Stock options granted from 1999 through July 2003 generally become exercisable over a four-year annual vesting period and expire 15 years from the date of grant. Prior
to 1999, stock options generally became exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expired 10 years from the date of grant. 

        The

        To ensure the best market-based assumptions were used to determine the estimated fair value of stock options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003, we obtained two
independent market quotes. Our Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model value was not materially different from the independent quotes.

Restricted Stock Award Plans  

        Under the amended 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan and the amended 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "Restricted Stock Award Plans"), 40 million and
24 million shares of restricted common stock, respectively, were originally available to be granted to certain officers and key employees of our Company. 

        On
December 31, 2005, 31 million shares remain available for grant under the Restricted Stock Award Plans. Participants are entitled to vote and receive dividends on the
shares and, under the 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan, participants are reimbursed by our Company for income taxes imposed on the award, but not for taxes generated by the reimbursement payment. The
shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may be forfeited if a participant leaves our Company for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, absent a change in control of our
Company. 

98




 


        The
following awards were outstanding as of December 31, 2005: 



•422,700
shares of time-based restricted stock in which the restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified period of time. An
additional 10,000 shares were promised for an employee based outside of the United States;
•713,000
shares of performance-based restricted stock in which restrictions lapse upon the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified performance period. An
additional 75,000 shares were promised, based upon achievement of relevant performance criteria, for an employee based outside of the United States; and
•2,356,728
performance share unit awards which could result in a future grant of restricted stock after the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified
performance period. Such awards are subject to adjustment based on the final performance relative to the goals, resulting in a minimum grant of no shares and a maximum grant of 3,499,092 shares. 


        In
the third quarter of 2004, in connection with Douglas N. Daft's retirement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors released to Mr. Daft 200,000 shares of
restricted stock previously granted to him during the period from April 1992 to October 1998. The terms of these grants provided that the restricted shares be released upon retirement
after age 62 but not earlier than five years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee determined to release the shares in recognition of Mr. Daft's 27 years of service to the
Company and the fact that he would turn 62 in March 2005. Mr. Daft forfeited 500,000 shares of restricted stock granted to him in November 2000, since as of the date of his retirement,
he had not held these shares for five years from the date of grant. In addition, Mr. Daft forfeited 1,000,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock, since Mr. Daft retired prior
to the completion of the performance period.

In 2005 and 2004, the Company granted time-based restricted stock awards with average fair value of $41.80 per share and $48.97 per share, respectively.



2

In 2005, the Company promised to grant an additional 10,000 shares upon completion of three years of service. This award is similar to time-based restricted stock, including the payment of dividend equivalents, but was granted in this manner because
the employee was based outside of the United States.

 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards  



        In 2001, shareowners approved an amendment to the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan to allow for the grant of performance-based awards. These awards are released
only upon the achievement of specific measurable performance criteria. These awards pay dividends during the performance period. The majority of awards have specific earnings per share targets for
achievement. If the earnings per share targets are not met, the awards will be cancelled.

In 2005, 50,000 shares of three-year performance-based restricted stock were granted at an average fair value of $42.40 per share. In 2003, 52,720 shares of three-year performance-based restricted stock were granted at an
average fair value of $42.91 per share.



2

In 2002, the Company promised to grant an additional 50,000 shares at the end of three years and an additional 75,000 shares at the end of four years, at an average fair value of $46.88 per share, if the Company achieved predefined performance
targets over the respective measurement periods. These awards are similar to the performance-based restricted stock, including the payment of dividend equivalents, but were granted in this manner because the employees were based outside of the United
States. The award to grant 50,000 shares was cancelled during 2005 because the performance target was not met. The award to grant 75,000 shares was outstanding as of December 31, 2005.





        The Company did not recognize compensation expense for the majority of these awards, as it is not probable the performance targets will be
achieved. 



 Performance Share Unit Awards  



        In 2003, the Company modified its use of performance-based awards and established a program to grant performance share unit awards under the 1989 Restricted Stock
Award Plan to executives. The number of performance share units earned shall be determined at the end of each performance period, generally three years, based on performance criteria determined by the
Board of Directors and may result in an award of restricted stock for U.S. participants and certain international participants at that time. The restricted stock may be granted to other international
participants shortly before the fifth anniversary of the original award. Restrictions on such stock generally lapse on the fifth anniversary of the original award date. Generally, performance share
unit awards are subject to the performance criteria of compound annual growth in earnings per share over the performance period, as adjusted for certain items approved by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors ("adjusted EPS"). The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year to year comparison of the specified performance criteria. Performance share units do not pay
dividends during the performance period. Accordingly, the fair value of these units is the quoted market value of the Company stock 

100




 

on
the date of the grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. 

        Performance
share unit Target Awards for the 2004-2006, 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 performance periods require adjusted EPS growth in line with our Company's internal projections over the
performance periods. In the event adjusted EPS exceeds the target projection, additional shares up to the Maximum Award may be granted. In the event adjusted EPS falls below the target projection, a
reduced number of shares as few as the Threshold Award may be granted. If adjusted EPS falls below the Threshold Award performance level, no shares will be granted. Of the outstanding granted
performance share unit awards as of December 31, 2005, 726,379; 862,649; and 695,700 awards are for the 2004-2006, 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 performance periods, respectively. In addition, 72,000
performance share unit awards, with predefined qualitative performance criteria and release criteria that differ from the program described above, were granted in 2004 and were outstanding as of
December 31, 2005.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company granted performance share unit awards with average fair value of $37.71 per share, $38.71 per share and $46.78 per share, respectively.





        The
Company recognizes compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria specified in the plan will be achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the
remaining performance period and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company has concluded that it is not probable the performance criteria for the 2004-2006 performance
period will be achieved; accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for awards related to this performance period. 


NOTE 15: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  

        Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We
also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement
arrangements outside the United States. We use a measurement date of December 31 for substantially all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans.

1
For pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For other benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.



2

During 2004, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $67 million due to the adoption of FSP 106-2. Refer to Note 1.



3

Benefits paid from pension benefit plans during 2005 and 2004 included $28 million and $25 million, respectively, in payments related to unfunded pension plans that were paid from Company assets. All of the benefits paid from other benefit plans
during 2005 and 2004 were paid from Company assets.





        The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $2,650 million and $2,440 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. 

        For
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the total projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $1,391 million and
$702 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005, and $1,112 million and $388 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. For pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the total accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $875 million and $331 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2005, and $916 million and $341 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004.

On March 27, 2003, the primary qualified and nonqualified U.S. pension plans, as well as the U.S. postretirement health care plan, were remeasured to reflect the effect of the curtailment resulting from the Company's
streamlining initiatives. Refer to Note 18. The discount rate assumption used to determine 2003 net periodic benefit cost for these U.S. plans was 63/4 percent prior to the remeasurement and 61/2
percent subsequent to the remeasurement. This change in the discount rate is reflected in the 2003 weighted-average discount rate of 6 percent for all pension benefit plans and 61/2 percent for other benefit
plans.

        The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit
obligations could be effectively settled. These rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities was constructed that mirrors
the specific benefit obligations for each of our primary U.S. plans. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and
our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of total pension plan assets were invested in common stock of our Company.



2

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of total pension plan assets were invested in real estate.





        Investment
objectives for the Company's U.S. pension plan assets, which comprise 71 percent of total pension plan assets as of December 31, 2005, are to: 



(1)optimize
the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;
(2)maintain
a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;
(3)maintain
careful control of the risk level within each asset class; and
(4)focus
on a long-term return objective. 

105




 





        Asset
allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.
Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among
asset classes. 

        Investment
guidelines are established with each investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that
determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment managers are prohibited from
buying or selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Furthermore, investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated
investment style or guidelines. 

        As
of December 31, 2005, no investment manager was responsible for more than 10 percent of total U.S. plan assets. In addition, diversification requirements for each
investment manager prevent a single security or other investment from exceeding 10 percent, at historical cost, of the total U.S. plan assets. 

        The
expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the
context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected
long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2005 net periodic pension cost for the U.S. plans was 8.5 percent. As of December 31, 2005, the 10-year
annualized return on U.S. plan assets was 9.6 percent, the 15-year annualized return was 11.6 percent, and the annualized return since inception was 12.7 percent. 

        Plan
assets for our pension plans outside the United States are insignificant on an individual plan basis.

Defined Contribution Plans  

        Our Company sponsors a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under this plan, we match 100 percent of
participants' contributions up to a maximum of 3 percent of compensation. Company contributions to the U.S. plan were approximately $21 million, $18 million and $20 million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. Company contributions to those plans were approximately
$14 million, $8 million and $7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

        Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits from having significant operations outside the United States that are taxed at rates lower than
the statutory U.S. rate of 35 percent. 

        Undistributed
earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $5.1 billion at December 31, 2005. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject
to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S.
income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however, unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of the
U.S. liability. 

108




 

        As
discussed in Note 1, the Jobs Creation Act was enacted in October 2004. One of the provisions provides a one-time benefit related to foreign tax credits
generated by equity investments in prior years. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of this law change in 2004. The Jobs Creation Act also
included a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company decided to
repatriate approximately $2.5 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings. Therefore, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on such previously unremitted foreign earnings of
approximately $152 million in the first quarter of 2005. Also, during 2005, the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Treasury issued additional guidance
related to the Jobs Creation Act. As a result of this guidance, the Company reduced the accrued taxes previously provided on such unremitted earnings by $25 million in the second quarter of
2005. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated an additional $3.6 billion, with an associated tax liability of approximately $188 million. Therefore, the total
previously unremitted earnings that was repatriated during the full year of 2005 was $6.1 billion with an associated tax liability of approximately $315 million. This liability was
recorded in the current year as federal and state and local tax expenses in the amount of $301 million and $14 million, respectively.

        On December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $116 million and $194 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets
located in countries outside the United States. 

        On
December 31, 2005, we had approximately $3,345 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of approximately
$1,365 million must be utilized within the next five years; $123 million must be utilized within the next 10 years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than
10 years. 

        As
of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had valuation allowances of $786 million, $854 million and $630 million, respectively, which were
primarily related to the realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. In 2005, the Company recognized a decrease in its valuation allowances
of $68 million. In 2004, the Company recognized an increase in its valuation allowances of $224 million. In 2003, the Company recognized a decrease in its valuation allowances of
$108 million. 

NOTE 17: SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND NONOPERATING ITEMS  

        In 2005, our Company received approximately $109 million related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit concerning price-fixing in the sale of HFCS
purchased by the Company during the years 1991 to 1995. Subsequent to the receipt of this settlement amount, the Company distributed approximately $62 million to
certain bottlers in North America. From 1991 to 1995, the Company purchased HFCS on behalf of these bottlers. Therefore, these bottlers were ultimately entitled to a portion of the proceeds of the
settlement. Of the approximately $62 million we distributed to certain bottlers in North America, approximately $49 million was distributed to CCE. The Company's remaining share of the
settlement was approximately $47 million, which was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and impacted the Corporate operating segment. 

        During
2005, we recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by equity method investees. Refer to Note 3. 

        The
Company recorded approximately $50 million of expense in 2005 as a result of a change in our estimated service period for the acceleration of certain stock-based compensation
awards. Refer to Note 14. 

        Equity
income in 2005 was reduced by approximately $33 million for the Corporate segment, primarily related to our proportionate share of the tax liability recorded by CCE
resulting from its repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act, as well as our proportionate share of restructuring charges. Those amounts were partially offset
by our proportionate share of CCE's HFCS lawsuit settlement proceeds and changes in certain of CCE's state and provincial tax rates. Refer to Note 2. 

        Our
Company recorded impairment charges during 2005 of approximately $84 million related to certain trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines and approximately
$1 million related to impairment of other assets. These impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. Refer to Note 5. 

        During
2004, our Company's equity income benefited by approximately $37 million for our proportionate share of a favorable tax settlement related to Coca-Cola FEMSA. 

        In
2004, we recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by CCE. Refer to Note 3. 

110




 


        We
recorded impairment charges during 2004 of approximately $374 million, primarily related to the impairment of franchise rights at CCEAG and approximately $18 million
related to other assets. These impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. Refer to Note 5. 

        We
recorded additional impairment charges in 2004 of approximately $88 million. These impairments primarily related to the write-downs of certain manufacturing investments and an
intangible asset. As a result of operating losses, management prepared analyses of cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. Because the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying value of such assets, we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges were
recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. 

        Also
in 2004, our Company received a $75 million insurance settlement related to the class action lawsuit that was settled in 2000. The Company donated $75 million to The
Coca-Cola Foundation in 2004. 

        In
2003, the Company reached a settlement with certain defendants in a vitamin antitrust litigation matter. In that litigation, the Company alleged that certain vitamin manufacturers
participated in a global conspiracy to fix the price of some vitamins, including vitamins used in the manufacture of some of the Company's products. Also in 2003, the Company received a settlement
relating to this litigation of approximately $52 million, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold. 

        Refer
to Note 2 for disclosure regarding the merger of Coca-Cola FEMSA and Panamco in 2003 and the recording of a $102 million noncash pretax charge to the
consolidated statement of income line item equity income—net. 


        During
2003, we recorded approximately $8 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by equity method investees. Refer to Note 3. 

NOTE 18: STREAMLINING COSTS  

        During 2003, the Company took steps to streamline and simplify its operations, primarily in North America and Germany. In North America, the Company integrated
the operations of three formerly separate North American business units—Coca-Cola North America, The Minute Maid Company and Coca-Cola Fountain. In Germany, CCEAG
took steps to improve its efficiency in sales, distribution and manufacturing, and our German Division office also implemented streamlining initiatives. Selected other operations also took steps to
streamline their operations to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness. As disclosed in Note 1, under SFAS No. 146, a liability is accrued only when certain criteria are met. All of
the Company's streamlining initiatives met the criteria of SFAS No. 146 as of December 31, 2003, and all related costs were incurred as of December 31, 2003. 

        Employees
separated from the Company as a result of these streamlining initiatives were offered severance or early retirement packages, as appropriate, which included both financial and
nonfinancial components. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2003 included costs associated with involuntary terminations and other direct costs associated with
implementing these initiatives. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 3,700 associates were separated pursuant to these streamlining initiatives. Other direct costs included the relocation of
employees; contract termination costs; costs associated with the development, communication and administration of these initiatives; and asset write-offs. During 2003, the Company incurred
total pretax expenses related to these streamlining initiatives of approximately $561 million, or $0.15 per share

after-tax.
These expenses were recorded in our consolidated statements of income line item other operating charges. 


        The
table below summarizes the costs incurred in 2003, the balances of accrued streamlining expenses, and the movement in those balances as of and for the years ended December 31,

NOTE 19: ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS  

       During 2005, our Company's acquisition and investment activity totaled approximately $637 million and included the acquisition of the German soft drink
bottling company Bremer Erfrischungsgetraenke GmbH ("Bremer") for approximately $160 million from InBev SA. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of
Bremer's operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning in September 2005. The Company recorded approximately $54 million of property, plant and
equipment, approximately $85 million of franchise rights and approximately $58 million of goodwill related to this acquisition. The franchise rights have been assigned an indefinite
life, and the goodwill was allocated to the Germany and Nordic reporting unit within the European Union operating segment. 

112




 


        In
August 2005, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent interest in the business of CCDA Waters L.L.C. ("CCDA") not previously owned by our Company. Our Company
and Danone Waters of North America, Inc. ("DWNA") had formed CCDA in July 2002 for the production, marketing and distribution of DWNA's bottled spring and source water business in the
United States. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the consolidated results of CCDA's operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements
since July 2002. CCDA is included in our North America operating segment. In July 2005, the Company acquired Sucos Mais, a Brazilian juice company. The results of Sucos Mais have been included
in our consolidated financial statements since July 2005. 

        Assuming
the results of these businesses had been included in operations beginning on January 1, 2005, pro forma financial data would not be required due to immateriality. 


        On
April 20, 2005, our Company and Coca-Cola HBC jointly acquired Multon for a total purchase price of approximately $501 million, split equally between the
Company and Coca-Cola HBC. The Company's investment in Multon is accounted for under the equity method. Equity income—net includes our proportionate share of the results of
Multon's operations beginning April 20, 2005. 

        During
2004, our Company's acquisition and investment activity totaled approximately $267 million, primarily related to the purchase of trademarks, brands and related contractual
rights in Latin America, none of which was individually significant. 

        During
2003, our Company's acquisition and investment activity totaled approximately $359 million. These acquisitions included purchases of trademarks, brands and related
contractual rights of approximately $142 million, none of which was individually significant. Other acquisition and investing activity totaled approximately $217 million, none of which
were individually significant. In March 2003, our Company acquired a 100 percent ownership interest in Truesdale from our equity method investee CCE for cash consideration of
approximately $58 million. Truesdale owns a noncarbonated beverage production facility. The purchase price was allocated primarily to property, plant and equipment acquired. No amount was
allocated to intangible assets. Truesdale is included in our North America operating segment. 

NOTE 20: OPERATING SEGMENTS  

        During 2005, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure impacting its Europe, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment and its Asia operating
segment. The Company replaced these operating segments with three new operating segments: the European Union operating segment; the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment; and the East,
South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. The European Union operating segment includes the Company's operations in all of the current member states of the European Union as well as the European
Free Trade Association countries, Switzerland, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and Greenland. The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment includes the Company's operations in
China, Japan, Eurasia and Middle East (other than Israel and the Palestinian Territories), Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and other European countries not included in the European Union operating
segment. The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment includes the Company's operations in India, the Philippines, Southeast and West Asia, and South Pacific and Korea. As of
December 31, 2005, our Company's operating structure consisted of the following operating segments: North America; Africa; East, South Asia and Pacific Rim; European Union; Latin America; North
Asia, Eurasia and Middle East; and Corporate. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the new operating structure described above. 

113




 


Segment Products and Services  

        The business of our Company is nonalcoholic beverages. Our operating segments derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage
concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. The following table summarizes the contribution to net operating revenues from Company operations (in millions):

Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss  

        Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the different factors affecting financial performance. Segment
income or loss includes substantially all of the segment's costs of production, distribution and administration. Our Company typically manages and evaluates equity method investments and related
income on a segment level. However, we manage certain investments, such as our equity interests in CCE and Coca-Cola HBC, within the Corporate operating segment. Our Company manages income taxes and
financial costs, such as interest income and expense, on a global basis within the Corporate operating segment. We evaluate segment performance based on income or loss before income taxes.

NAME="page_eu1033_1_117">   REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  


The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries  

        Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain
amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements. 

        Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Company's Board of Directors, applicable to all
Company Directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        The
Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing
standards, the Exchange Act and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Committee also meets periodically
with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Committee. Our
Audit Committee's Report can be found in the Company's 2006 Proxy statement. 

        Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on
our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. 


        The

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareowners  The Coca-Cola Company  

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 

        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. 

        As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2004 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003)
regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Board of Directors and Shareowners  The Coca-Cola Company  


        We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The
Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in  Internal Control—Integrated Framework<FONT
SIZE=2> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
The Coca-Cola Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. 

        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


        In
our opinion, management's assessment that The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, and our report dated February 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
