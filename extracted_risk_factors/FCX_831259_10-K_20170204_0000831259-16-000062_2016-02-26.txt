It is approximately 60 miles west of Prescott and 100 miles northwest of Phoenix. The property can be reached by Arizona Highway 96, which ends at the town of Bagdad. The closest railroad is at Hillside, Arizona, approximately 24 miles southeast on Arizona Highway 96. The open-pit mining operation has been ongoing since 1945, and prior mining was conducted through underground workings.The Bagdad mine is a porphyry copper deposit containing both sulfide and oxide mineralization. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides and are the primary economic minerals in the mine. Chalcocite is the most common secondary copper sulfide mineral, and the predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla, malachite and azurite.The Bagdad operation consists of a 75,000 metric ton-per-day concentrator that produces copper and molybdenum concentrate, an SX/EW plant that can produce up to 32 million pounds per year of copper cathode from solution generated by low-grade stockpile leaching, and a pressure-leach plant to process molybdenum concentrate. The available mining fleet consists of thirty 235-metric ton haul trucks loaded by six shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 48 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 250,000 metric tons of material per day.Bagdad’s production totaled 210 million pounds of copper and 9 million pounds of molybdenum in 2015, 237 million pounds of copper and 9 million pounds of molybdenum in 2014, and 216 million pounds of copper and 8 million pounds of molybdenum in 2013.Bagdad is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 15 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is 1,200 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 310 meters above sea level. The Bagdad operation encompasses approximately 21,750 acres, comprising 21,150 acres of patented mining claims and other fee lands and 600 acres of unpatented mining claims.Bagdad receives electrical power from Arizona Public Service Company. We believe the Bagdad operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations. 10Table of ContentsSafford Our wholly owned Safford mine has been in operation since 2007 and is an open-pit copper mining complex located in Graham County, Arizona, approximately 8 miles north of the town of Safford and 170 miles east of Phoenix. The site is accessible by paved county road off U.S. Highway 70.The Safford mine includes two copper deposits that have oxide mineralization overlaying primary copper sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and copper-bearing iron oxides with the predominant copper sulfide material being chalcopyrite.The property is a mine-for-leach project and produces copper cathode. The operation consists of two open pits feeding a crushing facility with a capacity of 103,000 metric tons per day. The crushed ore is delivered to leach pads by a series of overland and portable conveyors. Leach solutions feed a SX/EW facility with a capacity of 240 million pounds of copper per year. A sulfur burner plant is also in operation at Safford, providing a cost-effective source of sulphuric acid used in SX/EW operations. The available mining fleet consists of sixteen 235-metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 31 to 34 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 225,000 metric tons of material per day.Safford’s copper production totaled 202 million pounds in 2015, 139 million pounds in 2014 and 146 million pounds in 2013.Safford is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 10 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is 1,250 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to have an elevation of 750 meters above sea level. The Safford operation encompasses approximately 25,000 acres, comprising 21,000 acres of patented lands, 3,950 acres of unpatented lands and 50 acres of land held by federal permit.The Safford operation’s electrical power is primarily sourced from Tucson Electric Power Company, Arizona Public Service Company and the Luna Energy facility. Although we believe the Safford operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations, we are a party to litigation that may impact our water right claims or rights to continued use of currently available water supplies, which could adversely affect our water supply for the Safford operation. Refer to . "Risk Factors" and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for further discussion. 12Table of ContentsMiamiOur wholly owned Miami mine is an open-pit copper mining complex located in Gila County, Arizona, approximately 90 miles east of Phoenix and 6 miles west of the city of Globe on U.S. Highway 60. The site is accessible by a paved highway and by rail.The Miami mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has leachable oxide and secondary sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla, copper-bearing clays, malachite and azurite. Chalcocite and covellite are the most important secondary copper sulfide minerals.Since about 1915, the Miami mining operation had processed copper ore using both flotation and leaching technologies. As a result of current economic conditions, we have revised operating plans to suspend mining operations at the Miami mine and produce copper through leaching material already placed on stockpiles. The design capacity of the SX/EW plant is 200 million pounds of copper per year.Miami’s copper production totaled 43 million pounds in 2015, 57 million pounds in 2014 and 61 million pounds in 2013.Miami is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 18 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is 1,390 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom will have an elevation of 810 meters above sea level. The Miami operation encompasses approximately 9,100 acres, comprising 8,750 acres of patented mining claims and other fee lands and 350 acres of unpatented mining claims.Miami receives electrical power through long-term contracts with the Salt River Project and natural gas through long-term contracts with El Paso Natural Gas as the transporter. Although we believe the Miami operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations, we are a party to litigation that may impact our water right claims or rights to continued use of currently available water supplies, which could adversely affect our water supply for the Miami operation. Refer to . “Risk Factors.” 17Table of ContentsEl AbraWe own a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the state-owned copper enterprise Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile (CODELCO).El Abra is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of Calama in Chile’s El Loa province, Region II. The site is accessible by paved highway and by rail.The El Abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization. The predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite. There is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralizationas chalcocite. The oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite. There are lesser amounts of copper-bearing clays and tenorite.The El Abra operation consists of an open-pit copper mine and a SX/EW facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 125,000 metric ton-per-day crushed leach circuit and a similar-sized ROM leaching operation. The available fleet consists of forty-one 220-metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 34 to 63 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 214,000 metric tons of material per day.The revised operating plans for El Abra reduce mining and stacking rates by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs, defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing operations. El Abra’s copper production totaled 324 million pounds in 2015, 367 million pounds in 2014 and 343 million pounds in 2013.Exploration results in recent years at El Abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project. Future investments will be dependent on technical studies, economic factors and global copper market conditions.El Abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 4,180 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3,430 meters above sea level. El Abra controls a total of approximately 151,300 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit, stockpiles, process plant, and water wellfield and pipeline. In addition, El Abra has land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine, the water wellfield, power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer.El Abra currently receives electrical power under a long-term contract with E-Cl. Water for our El Abra processing operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer pursuant to regulatory approval. We believe El Abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations. El Abra is conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production through ore mill processing. For a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, refer to . "Risk Factors" for further discussion of risks associated with operations in Indonesia.Grasberg Minerals District.  PT-FI operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of New Guinea. We and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in Block A since 1967. The Grasberg minerals district has three operating mines: the Grasberg open pit, the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine and the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) underground mine. The Grasberg minerals district also includes the developed Big Gossan underground mine where operations are currently suspended and are expected to restart in the first half of 2017. PT-FI also has several projects in progress in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of the large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the Grasberg open pit, currently anticipated to occur in late 2017. Refer to MD&A for further discussion of these projects. PT-FI’s production, including our joint venture partner’s share, totaled 752 million pounds of copper and 1.23 million ounces of gold in 2015, 651 million pounds of copper and 1.13 million ounces of gold in 2014 and 928 million pounds of copper and 1.14 million ounces of gold in 2013.Our principal source of power for all our Indonesian operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in 1998. Diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations.  20Table of ContentsAlthough we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesian operations, lower rainfall resulting from El Niño weather conditions in the second half of 2015 has impacted operations, and may continue to impact operations in 2016. Our Indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches.Grasberg Open Pit  PT-FI began open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. Mining operations are expected to continue through the end of 2017, and production from the ore stockpiles, which are located outside of the pit limits, are expected to continue until early 2019. Production in the open pit is currently at the 3,160- to 3,715-meter elevation level and totaled 42 million metric tons of ore in 2015, which provided 70 percent of PT-FI's 2015 mill feed.The current open-pit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units. The larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 141 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 276 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters, which mined an average of 250,400 metric tons of material per day in 2015, 298,400 metric tons per day in 2014 and 381,000 metric tons per day in 2013. Crushing and conveying systems are integral to the Grasberg mine and provide the capacity to transport more than 250,000 metric tons of ore per day. For the year 2015, Grasberg's crushing and conveying systems delivered an average of 116,000 metric tons of ore per day to the mill. Grasberg's overburden handling system is capable of delivering 175,000 metric tons per day. For the year 2015, the Grasberg overburden handling system delivered an average of 43,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles. The remaining overburden moved by haul trucks averaged 72,000 metric tons per day in 2015. Ore milled from the Grasberg open pit averaged 115,900 metric tons of ore per day in 2015, 69,100 metric tons of ore per day in 2014 and 127,700 metric tons of ore per day in 2013.DOZ Underground MineThe DOZ ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone. PT-FI began production from the DOZ ore body in 1989 using open-stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the Grasberg open pit. Production resumed in September 2000 using the block-cave method and is at the 3,110-meter elevation level. The DOZ is a mature block-cave mine that previously operated at 80,000 metric tons of ore per day. Current operating rates from the DOZ underground mine, which range from 35,000 to 65,000 metric tons of ore per day, are driven by the value of the incremental DOZ ore grade compared to the ore from the Grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the DMLZ and Grasberg Block Cave underground mines. During 2015, ore milled from the DOZ underground mine averaged 43,700 metric tons of ore per day. Production at the DOZ underground mine is expected to continue through 2021. The DOZ mine fleet consists of over 250 pieces of mobile equipment. The primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 LHD units and 21 haul trucks. Each production LHD unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore. Using ore passes and chutes, the LHD units transfer ore into 55-metric ton capacity haul trucks. The trucks dump into two gyratory crushers, and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing.The success of the development of the DOZ mine, one of the world’s largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future development of PT-FI’s large-scale, underground ore bodies.DMLZ Underground MineThe DMLZ ore body lies below the DOZ underground mine at the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. PT-FI began production from the DMLZ ore body in September 2015 using the block-cave method. Ore milled from the DMLZ underground mine averaged 2,900 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2015 (3,500 metric tons per day in fourth-quarter 2015). Targeted production rates once the DMLZ underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021. Production at the DMLZ underground mine is expected to continue through 2040.The DMLZ mine fleet consists of over 277 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 33 LHD units and 19 haul trucks used in production and development activities. 21Table of ContentsBig Gossan Underground MineProduction from the Big Gossan ore body, which is currently suspended, is expected to restart in the first half of 2017 and ramp up to 7,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2019. The Big Gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site. It is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters. The mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill. Stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level. Trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher. The crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two-skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt. The belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing.The Big Gossan mine fleet consists of over 135 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes five LHD units and three haul trucks used in development and production activities.Description of Ore Bodies. Our Indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg open pit and block cave, and portions of the DOZ block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the DOZ and all of the Big Gossan) occur as “magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.The copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite.The following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported Indonesia ore bodies. 22Table of ContentsThe following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported Indonesia ore bodies and their locations.AfricaTFM is organized under the laws of the DRC. We own an effective 56 percent interest in TFM, with the remaining ownership interests held by Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin) (an effective 24 percent interest) and La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines), which is wholly owned by the DRC government (a 20 percent non-dilutable interest). TFM is entitled to mine in the DRC under an Amended and Restated Mining Convention (ARMC) with the DRC government. The original Mining Convention entered into in 1996 was replaced with the ARMC in 2005 and was further amended in 2010 (approved in 2011). The current ARMC will remain in effect for as long as the Tenke concessions are exploitable.TFM pays a royalty of two percent of net revenues under the ARMC, which totaled $25 million in 2015 and $29 million in both 2014 and 2013.The Tenke minerals district is located in the Southeast region of the DRC approximately 110 miles northwest of Lubumbashi and is accessible by paved roads and by rail. The deposits are sediment-hosted copper and cobalt  23Table of Contentsdeposits with oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide and sulfide mineralization. The dominant oxide minerals are malachite, pseudomalachite and heterogenite. Important sulfide minerals consist of bornite, carrollite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite.The Tenke minerals district contains an open-pit copper and cobalt mining complex, which commenced initial copper production in March 2009. TFM completed its second phase expansion project in early 2013, which included increasing mine, mill and processing capacity. Construction of a second sulphuric acid plant is under way, with completion expected in the first half of 2016. We continue to engage in exploration activities and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at Tenke. Future development and expansion opportunities are being deferred pending improved market conditions.The current equipment fleet includes three 17-cubic meter mass excavators, five 12-cubic meter front-end loaders, thirteen 7-cubic meter front-end loaders, thirty-six 91-metric ton haul trucks and six 80-metric ton haul trucks.Copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitation-leach plant. Production from the Tenke minerals district totaled 449 million pounds of copper and 35 million pounds of cobalt in 2015, 447 million pounds of copper and 29 million pounds of cobalt in 2014, and 462 million pounds of copper and 28 million pounds of cobalt in 2013. The Tenke minerals district is located in a tropical region; however, temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes. Weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season, each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is expected to be 1,520 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,110 meters above sea level. The Tenke deposits are covered by six exploitation permits totaling approximately 394,450 acres.TFM has long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with La Société Nationale d’Electricité, the state-owned electric utility company serving the region. The results of a recent water exploration program, as well as the regional geological and hydro-geological conditions, indicate that adequate water is available during the expected life of the operation.Smelting Facilities and Other Mining PropertiesAtlantic Copper. Our wholly owned Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the Huelva, Spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2027.The design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300,000 metric tons of copper per year, and the refinery has a capacity of 285,000 metric tons of copper per year. During 2015, Atlantic Copper treated 1.05 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap, and produced 293,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 284,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery. Following is a summary of Atlantic Copper's concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the years ended December 31: 2015 2014 2013North America copper mines23% 21% 13%South America mining3a 21 32Indonesia mining3 8 16Third parties71 50 39 100% 100% 100%a.The decrease in purchases from the South America mines, compared to the years 2014 and 2013, primarily reflects the impact of the November 2014 sale of the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines.Atlantic Copper's major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. Atlantic Copper completed a 68-day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 and the next short-term maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2017.PT Smelting. PT-FI’s COW required us to construct, or cause to be constructed, a smelter in Indonesia if we and the Indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of PT Smelting, an Indonesian company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. PT Smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery. PT-FI owns 25 percent of PT Smelting, with the remainder owned by Mitsubishi  24Table of ContentsMaterials Corporation (60.5 percent), Mitsubishi Corporation Unimetals Ltd. (9.5 percent) and JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corporation (5 percent).PT-FI’s contract with PT Smelting requires PT-FI to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum rate) necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. PT-FI may also sell copper concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. During 2015, PT Smelting treated 744,800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 199,700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 198,400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery. PT Smelting resumed operations in September 2015, following a temporary suspension in July 2015, and operated at approximately 80 percent capacity until November 2015 when required repairs of an acid plant cooling tower that was damaged during the suspension were completed.PT Smelting's maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting completed a 23-day maintenance turnaround during 2014, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for third-quarter 2016.Miami Smelter. We own and operate a smelter at our Miami mining operation in Arizona. The smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements. The Miami smelter is installing emission control equipment that will allow it to operate in compliance with recently adopted enhanced air quality standards (refer to . "Risk Factors" for further discussion).Major maintenance turnarounds (which take approximately three weeks to complete) typically occur approximately every 14 months for the Miami smelter, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. The Miami Smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in third-quarter 2015, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for fourth-quarter 2016.Rod & Refining Operations. Our Rod & Refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in North America, including a refinery in El Paso, Texas; rod mills in El Paso, Texas, Norwich, Connecticut, and Miami, Arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in Bayway, New Jersey. We refine our copper anode production from our Miami smelter at our El Paso refinery. The El Paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our Miami smelter. Our El Paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium.Molybdenum Conversion Facilities. We process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the U.S. and Europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. We operate molybdenum roasters in Sierrita, Arizona; Fort Madison, Iowa; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure-leach plant in Bagdad, Arizona. We also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in Stowmarket, United Kingdom. Freeport Cobalt. In March 2013, we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related sales and marketing business. The acquisition provided direct end-market access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the Tenke minerals district. The joint venture operates under the name Freeport Cobalt, and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest. The remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in TFM, including 24 percent by Lundin and 20 percent by Gécamines. The Kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15,000 metric tons of cobalt, sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the Tenke minerals district.Other North America Copper Mines. We also have five non-operating copper mines in North America – Ajo, Bisbee, Twin Buttes and Tohono in Arizona, and Cobre in New Mexico – that have been on care-and-maintenance status for  25Table of Contentsseveral years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status. Mining Development Projects and Exploration We have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. Our near-term major development projects include the underground development activities in Grasberg (refer to MD&A for further discussion). Considering the long-term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. We continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves.Capital expenditures for mining operations totaled $3.3 billion (including $2.4 billion for major projects) in 2015, $4.0 billion (including $2.9 billion for major projects) in 2014 and $3.8 billion (including $2.3 billion for major projects) in 2013. Capital expenditures for major projects during the three years ended December 31, 2015, were primarily associated with the expansion projects at Morenci and Cerro Verde, and underground development activities at Grasberg. Capital expenditures for major projects at mining operations in the year 2016 are expected to approximate $1.4 billion and are primarily associated with underground development activities at Grasberg and remaining costs for the Cerro Verde expansion. PT-FI is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in Indonesia in parallel with completing negotiations on its COW and long-term operating rights. PT-FI has identified sites, and project definition studies and early engineering are being advanced. We are also engaged in discussions with potential partners for the project. The preliminary scope of the facilities involves smelting and refining capacity of one to two million metric tons per year of copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. We also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the Grasberg minerals district for the Kucing Liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the Grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. We expect to mine the Kucing Liar ore body using the block-cave method; aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the Kucing Liar ore body are projected to approximate $2.4 billion (which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031). Additionally, our current mine development plans include approximately $5 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the Grasberg open-pit operations cease. We expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2018 and 2035. Our mining exploration activities are generally near our existing mines, with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where we currently operate. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for what we believe could be significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America, and in the Tenke minerals district. The drilling data in North America also indicates the potential for significantly expanded sulfide production. Drilling results and exploration modeling provide a long-term pipeline for future growth in reserves and production capacity in established minerals districts. Exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled $102 million in 2015, $96 million in 2014 and $182 million in 2013. Exploration spending continues to be reduced from historical levels as a result of market conditions and is expected to approximate $52 million for the year 2016.Sources and Availability of Energy, Natural Resources and Raw MaterialsOur copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented 17 percent of our 2015 consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 250 million gallons of diesel fuel; 7,600 gigawatt hours of electricity at our North America, South America and Africa copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our Indonesia mining operation); 800 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and 1 million British thermal units (MMBtu) of natural gas at certain of our North America mines. Based on current cost estimates, we estimate energy will approximate 20 percent of our consolidated copper production costs for 2016. Our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. The loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations.

"Risk Factors," if production were to be curtailed at the Miami Smelter, we would be required to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid from third parties, thereby increasing our operating costs.Community and Human RightsWe have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. We continue to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs, which include:•comprehensive job training programs•basic education programs•public health programs, including malaria control and HIV                                                                                           •agricultural assistance programs•small and medium enterprise development programs•cultural promotion and preservation programs•clean water and sanitation projects•community infrastructure development•charitable donationsIn December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security (Voluntary Principles). We participated in developing these Voluntary Principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy. We completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014, the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program, including a review of our human rights policy. In February 2015, we updated our human rights policy to, among other things, reflect our commitment to integrating the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into our human rights program. We also participate in a multi-industry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and are integrating human rights due diligence into our business practices.We believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. As part of our ongoing, annual commitment to sustainable community development, we have made significant investments in social programs, including in-kind support and administration, across our global operations. Over the last five years, these investments have averaged $180 million per year. Nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. Refer to .

Initiatives include an integrated malaria control program; construction, renovation and building of local health facilities; construction and renovation of local schools; installation of over 115 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems; and economic development programs supporting development and training of local entrepreneurs, contractors and farmers. We have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country, including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems.Through the ARMC, TFM also contributes 0.3 percent of its net sales revenue to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health, education and agriculture. The TFM Social Community Fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives, one representative nominated by the provincial governor, four TFM representatives and an observer representative from Gecamines. A stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community leaders provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities, community needs, and  28Table of Contentstransparency of fund management. The TFM Social Community Fund contributions totaled $4 million in each of the years in 2015, 2014 and 2013.Security Matters. TFM maintains an unarmed internal security department composed of both employees and contractors. The national government also has assigned Mines Police to the TFM concession areas. The Mines Police are a division of the Congolese National Police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the DRC. TFM provides food, housing, medical services, supervised transportation, non-lethal equipment and monetary allowances as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession areas. The total cost to TFM for this support, including in-kind support, approximated $1 million in 2015, $2 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013.TFM also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel, other mining companies, non-governmental organizations and representatives from the United Nations to discuss security issues and concerns. As an outcome of the coordination meetings, TFM has partnered with MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC) to conduct human rights training in the TFM concessions for host government security personnel, local representatives and TFM security employees. 29Table of ContentsMining Production Data Years Ended December 31, (FCX’s net interest in %)2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 COPPER (millions of recoverable pounds)          North America          Morenci (85%)a902 691 564 537 522 Bagdad (100%)210 237 216 197 194 Safford (100%)202 139 146 175 151 Sierrita (100%)189 195 171 157 177 Miami (100%)43 57 61 66 66 Chino (100%)314 250 171 144 69 Tyrone (100%)84 94 96 83 76 Other (100%)3 7 6 4 3 Total North America1,947 1,670 1,431 1,363 1,258 South America          Cerro Verde (53.56%)545 500 558 595 647 El Abra (51%)324 367 343 338 274 Candelaria/Ojos del Salado (80%)b— 284 422 324 385 Total South America869 1,151 1,323 1,257 1,306 Indonesia          Grasberg (90.64%)c752 636 915 695 846 Africa          Tenke Fungurume (56%)d449 447 462 348 281 Consolidated4,017 3,904 4,131 3,663 3,691 Less noncontrolling interests680 725 801 723 710 Net3,337 3,179 3,330 2,940 2,981            GOLD (thousands of recoverable ounces)          North America (100%)a25 12 7 13 10 South America (80%)b— 72 101 83 101 Indonesia (90.64%)c1,232 1,130 1,142 862 1,272 Consolidated1,257 1,214 1,250 958 1,383 Less noncontrolling interests115 120 127 98 139 Net1,142 1,094 1,123 860 1,244            MOLYBDENUM (millions of recoverable pounds)          Henderson (100%)25 30 30 34 38 Climax (100%)e23 21 19 7 — North America copper mines (100%)a37 33 32 36 35 Cerro Verde (53.56%)7 11 13 8 10 Consolidated92 95 94 85 83 Less noncontrolling interest3 5 6 4 5 Net89 90 88 81 78            COBALT (millions of contained pounds)          Consolidated - Tenke Fungurume (56%)d35 29 28 26 25 Less noncontrolling interests15 13 12 11 11 Net20 16 16 15 14            a.Amounts are net of Morenci’s 15 percent joint venture partner interest.

Proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.Our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2015, were determined using long-term average prices of $2.00 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, LME spot copper prices averaged $2.97 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $1,276 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $9.45 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

The objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. We use a "break-even cutoff grade" to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. The break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production.Our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum, silver and cobalt. We value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. Copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. Our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade.The table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of December 31, 2015:                 Copper Equivalent Cutoff Grade (Percent) MolybdenumCutoff Grade(Percent) Mill Crushed orAgitation Leach ROMLeach MillNorth America       Morenci0.26 0.18 0.03 —Bagdad0.20 — 0.06 —Safford— 0.12 — —Sierrita0.18 — — —Chino0.24 — 0.08 —Tyrone— — 0.10 —Henderson— — — 0.12Climax— — — 0.05Cobre0.26 — 0.06 —South America       Cerro Verde0.17 0.19 0.14 —El Abra— 0.10 0.06 —Indonesia       DMLZ0.81 — — —Grasberg open pit0.25 — — —DOZ0.88 — — —Big Gossan1.88 — — —Grasberg Block Cave0.78 — — —Kucing Liar0.94 — — —Africa       Tenke Fungurume— 1.37 — — 36Table of ContentsDrill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals, such as geologists and geological engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification. Drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit.The following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type:  Average Drill Hole Spacing (in Meters)   Proven Probable Mining Unit Mill Leach Mill LeachNorth America         MorenciOpen Pit 86 86 122 122BagdadOpen Pit 86 86 122 122SaffordOpen Pit — 86 — 122SierritaOpen Pit 73 — 104 —MiamiOpen Pit — 61 — 91ChinoOpen Pit 43 86 86 122TyroneOpen Pit — 86 — 86HendersonBlock Cave 47 — 96 —ClimaxOpen Pit 61 — 91 —CobreOpen Pit 61 61 91 91South America         Cerro VerdeOpen Pit 50 50 100 100El AbraOpen Pit — 75 — 120Indonesia         DMLZBlock Cave 16 — 58 —Grasberg open pitOpen Pit 35 — 75 —DOZBlock Cave 23 — 57 —Big GossanOpen Stope 12 — 36 —Grasberg Block CaveBlock Cave 34 — 81 —Kucing LiarBlock Cave 39 — 98 —Africa         Tenke FungurumeOpen Pit — 50 — 100 37Table of ContentsProduction Sequencing The following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles. The chart also shows the term of PT-FI's COW. Production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. The sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production. The ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. In addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. Significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below.Mill and Leach Stockpiles Mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities. Because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles.  38Table of ContentsExpected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes.Following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of December 31, 2015:        Recoverable Million Average Recovery Copper Metric Tons Ore Grade (%) Rate (%) (billion pounds)Mill stockpiles        Cerro Verde159 0.32 81.8 0.9 Grasberg minerals district14 0.44 74.9 0.1  173     1.0          Leach stockpiles        Morenci5,982 0.24 2.2 0.7 Bagdad499 0.24 1.5 —a Safford213 0.44 14.3 0.3 Sierrita650 0.15 11.0 0.3 Miami498 0.39 2.9 0.1 Chino1,695 0.26 5.3 0.5 Tyrone1,121 0.28 2.3 0.2 Cerro Verde388 0.52 5.0 0.2 El Abra644 0.43 5.9 0.4 Tenke Fungurume45 1.31 90.9 1.2  11,735     3.9          Total FCX - 100% basis      4.9 Total FCX - Consolidated basisb      4.8 Total FCX - Net equity interestc      3.5          a.Amounts not shown because of rounding.b.Consolidated stockpiles represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia.

Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of our ownership in subsidiaries.Mineralized MaterialWe hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant. However, permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors. Estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of $2.20 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold, $12 per pound for molybdenum and $20 per ounce for silver. 39Table of ContentsMineralized MaterialEstimated at December 31, 2015    Milling Material Leaching Material Total Mineralized Material     Million         Million   Million   FCX’s metric Copper Gold Moly SIlver metric Copper metric   Interest tons % g/t % g/t tons % tons North America                   Morenci 85% 598 0.28 — 0.02 — 921 0.21 1,519 Bagdad 100% 746 0.27 —a 0.02 1.2 3 0.22 749 Safford 100% 188 0.65 0.12 — 2.4 60 0.31 248 Sierrita 100% 1,370 0.19 —a 0.02 1.1 — — 1,370 Chino 100% 180 0.47 0.03 0.01 0.4 37 0.26 217 Tyrone 100% — — — — — 11 0.43 11 Henderson 100% 78 — — 0.14 — — — 78 Climax 100% 337 — — 0.13 — — — 337 Cobre 100% 34 0.50 0.09 — 1.3 — — 34 Ajo 100% 437 0.40 0.06 0.01 0.8 — — 437 Cochise/Bisbee 100% — — — — — 250 0.46 250 Lone Star 100% — — — — — 679 0.47 679 Sanchez 100% — — — — — 148 0.29 148 Tohono 100% 220 0.72 — — — 270 0.67 490 Twin Buttes 100% 73 0.62 — 0.04 6.4 44 0.23 117 Christmas 100% 201 0.39 0.05 —a 1.0 — — 201 South America                   Cerro Verde 53.56% 250 0.35 — 0.01 1.4 33 0.48 283 El Abra 51% 2,024 0.45 0.02 0.01 1.4 199 0.30 2,223 Indonesia                   Grasberg minerals district 54.38%b 2,207 0.72 0.63 — 3.5 — — 2,207 Africa                   Tenke Fungurumec 56% 52 4.10 — — — 31 2.88 83 Kisanfuc 95% 49 2.48 — — — 47 3.16 96 Total FCX - 100% basis   9,044         2,733   11,777 Total FCX - Consolidated basisd   8,071         2,595   10,666 Total FCX - Net equity intereste   6,814         2,466   9,280    a.Amounts not shown because of rounding.b.FCX's interest in the Grasberg minerals district reflects our 60 percent joint venture ownership further reduced by noncontrolling interest ownership.c.Stated tonnage also includes cobalt at Tenke Fungurume (0.31 percent) and Kisanfu (1.15 percent).d.Consolidated basis represents estimated mineralized materials after reduction for joint venture partner interests in the Morenci mine in North America and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia.

For the year 2015, 88 percent of our oil and gas revenues, excluding the impact of derivative contracts, were from sales of oil and NGLs.Revised Operating PlansWe are taking continuing actions to reduce oil and gas costs and capital expenditures. FM O&G is undertaking a near-term deferral of exploration and development expenditures by idling the three Deepwater GOM drillships it has under contract. Refer to MD&A for further discussion.Acreage At December 31, 2015, we owned interests in oil and gas leases covering 4.4 million gross acres (2.5 million acres net to our interest). Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and do not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. The following table summarizes, by geographic area, the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage in which we held interests at December 31, 2015:     Developed  Undeveloped     Gross Acres Net Acres Gross Acres Net Acres U.S.:         Louisiana:          Onshore388,392 79,141 105,257 80,074   Offshore328,014 189,197 655,874 491,830  Texas:          Onshore16,865 3,621 209 653   Offshore28,800 15,906 — —  California:          Onshore60,898 60,406 65,259 40,847   Offshore44,049 39,618 712 712  Wyoming78,007 11,018 31,968 18,394  Nevada— — 246,073 246,073  Other states1,324 368 181,342 137,293   946,349 399,275 1,286,694 1,015,876  Morocco— — 2,154,014 1,120,087   946,349 399,275 3,440,708 2,135,963 As of December 31, 2015, 84 percent of our total net leasehold acreage is undeveloped. Many of our oil and gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful, we could lose our rights under such leases. At December 31, 2015, 24 percent of our total U.S. net undeveloped acres was covered by leases that expire from 2016 through 2018. As a result of declining crude oil prices, FM O&G’s current plans anticipate that the majority of expiring acreage will not be retained by drilling operations or other means. Currently, FM O&G has a commitment to drill a second well in Morocco in 2016. However, FM O&G is actively negotiating with its partners to modify the work program, which, if successful, would result in changes in the timing, amount or type of future commitment. The exploration permits covering FM O&G's Morocco acreage expire at the end of 2016; however, FM O&G has the ability, under certain circumstances, to extend the exploration permits through 2019.  41Table of ContentsPropertiesOur oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business.We believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we conduct minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties. We conduct title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets. Although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases, we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business.Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater GOM. FM O&G has a large strategic position in the Deepwater GOM with significant current oil production, strong cash margins and existing infrastructure with excess production and handling capacity. FM O&G’s Deepwater GOM properties and activities are principally located in four focus areas, which we refer to as Atwater Valley, Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon and Keathley Canyon. Following is a summary of FM O&G's Deepwater GOM platforms at December 31, 2015:            Capacity per DayPlatform Working Interest Field Location Type of Platform Production Commenced Water Depth (feet) Oil (MBbls) Gas (MMcf)Holsteina 100% Green Canyon Blocks 644, 645 and 688 Truss Spar 2004 4,300 113 142Horn Mountaina 100% Mississippi Canyon Blocks 126 and 127 Truss Spar 2002 5,400 75 72Marlin Huba 100% Severalb Tension Leg 2000 3,200 60 235Lucius 25.1%c Keathley Canyon Blocks 874, 875, 918 and 919 Truss Spar 2015 7,200 80 450Heidelberg 12.5% Green Canyon Blocks 859, 903, 904 and 948 Truss Spar 2016d 5,300 80 80Ram Powell 31.0% Viosca Knoll Blocks 911 to 913 and 955 to 957 Tension Leg 1997 3,200 70 310Hoover 33.3% Severale Deep Draft Caisson Vessel 2000 4,800 100 325a.We are the operator of the Holstein, Horn Mountain and Marlin Hub platforms.b.The Marlin Hub is the production facility for the Marlin field (S/2 Viosca Knoll Block 871 and N/2 Viosca Knoll Block 915), the Dorado field (S/2 Viosca Knoll Block 915) and the King field (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 84, 85, and 129). The Marlin field currently produces via a combination of platform and subsea tie-back wells, while the Dorado and King fields currently produce exclusively via subsea wells and tie-back infrastructure. c.FM O&G's consolidated subsidiary Plains Offshore Operations Inc. (Plains Offshore), holds a 20 percent working interest in the Lucius development. FM O&G's combined ownership in the Lucius development, including the 20 percent held by Plains Offshore, is 25.1 percent. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of Plains Offshore.d.In January 2016, first oil production commenced from three wells in the Heidelberg oil field.e.The Hoover platform is located in Alaminos Canyon Block 25. The Hoover field is located in Alaminos Canyon Blocks 25 and 26.FM O&G has a 100-percent interest in the Holstein Deep development, which is located in Green Canyon Block 643, west of the 100-percent owned Holstein platform, in 3,890 feet of water. Completion activities for the initial three-well subsea tieback development program are progressing, with first production expected in mid-2016. FM O&G also owns working interests in several oil discoveries in the Atwater Valley focus area, including Vito and Power Nap. FM O&G has an 18.67 percent interest in Vito, which is a deep subsalt Miocene oil discovery made in  42Table of Contents2009, located in 4,000 feet of water in the Mississippi Canyon area (Blocks 940, 941, 984 and 985) and a 50 percent interest in Power Nap, which is located in close proximity to Vito. FM O&G's Deepwater GOM exploration portfolio consists of interests in 136 blocks containing 55 prospects in the Pliocene, Miocene and Lower Tertiary reservoirs.GOM Shelf. The GOM Shelf properties are primarily located on the outer continental shelf in the shallow waters (less than 500 feet of water) of the GOM and onshore in the Gulf Coast area of Louisiana, with drilling depths not exceeding 15,000 feet considered to be traditional shelf prospects.Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous. Prospects with drilling depths below the salt weld (generally at depths exceeding 25,000 feet) are considered Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous prospects. FM O&G is the operator and has a 72 percent working interest (an approximate 49 percent net revenue interest) in Highlander, located onshore in South Louisiana. In December 2015, gross rates from the Highlander well averaged 44 MMcf  per day (21 MMcf per day net to FM O&G).California. FM O&G’s California assets provide an established oil production base with low-decline production profiles and long-lived reserves. Onshore California. FM O&G's onshore properties are located in the Los Angeles Basin and San Joaquin Basin. FM O&G holds a 100 percent working interest in the majority of its onshore positions including the Inglewood, Las Cienegas, Montebello, Packard and San Vicente fields in the Los Angeles Basin, and the Cymric, Midway Sunset, South Belridge, and North Belridge fields in the San Joaquin Basin. The Los Angeles Basin properties are characterized by light crude oil (21 to 32 degree American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity), have well depths ranging from 2,000 feet to over 10,000 feet and include both primary production and secondary recovery using waterflood methods (whereby water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil), where producing wells have a high ratio of water produced compared to total liquids produced (high water cuts). The San Joaquin Basin properties are characterized by heavier oil (12 to 16 degree API gravity) and shallow wells (generally less than 2,000 feet) that require enhanced oil recovery techniques, including steam injection. FM O&G also holds a 100 percent working interest in the Arroyo Grande Field located in San Luis Obispo County, which is characterized by heavier oil (12 to 16 degree API gravity) and well depths averaging 1,700 feet requiring continuous steam injection. Offshore California. All of the offshore California properties are located in federal waters approximately three to seven miles offshore in the Santa Maria Basin. FM O&G holds a 69.3 percent working interest in the Point Arguello Unit, composed of the Hidalgo, Hermosa and Harvest platforms, and the various partnerships owning the related transportation, processing and marketing infrastructure. Since second-quarter 2015, production from Point Arguello platforms has been shut in following the shutdowns of a third-party operated pipeline system that transports oil to various California refineries. FM O&G also holds a 100 percent working interest in the Point Pedernales field, which includes the Irene platform, that is utilized to access the Federal Outer Continental Shelf Monterey Reservoir by extended reach directional wells and support facilities which lie within the onshore Lompoc field. Haynesville. As of December 31, 2015, in the Haynesville shale, FM O&G has a non-operated interest in over 1,450 producing wells with an average working interest of 8.6 percent and leases covering 72,000 net acres. The Haynesville shale is characterized by dry gas production from the Jurassic-aged Haynesville shale formation in Louisiana and eastern Texas, and typical well depth is 10,500 feet. The area has historically been developed with horizontal wells more than 4,000 feet at a measured total depth of 16,000 feet. Madden. FM O&G owns a non-operated 14 percent working interest in the Madden Deep Unit and Lost Cabin Gas Plant located in central Wyoming. The Madden Deep Unit is a federal unit operated by a third party and consists of acreage in the Wind River Basin. The Madden area is characterized by gas production from multiple stratigraphic horizons of the Lower Fort Union, Lance, Mesaverde and Cody sands and the Madison Dolomite. Production from the Madden Deep Unit is typically found at depths ranging from 5,500 to 25,000 feet.  Exploration and Development ActivitiesFM O&G has significant proved, probable and possible reserves, with valuable infrastructure and associated resources with attractive long-term production and development potential. 43Table of ContentsSince commencing development activities in 2014 at its three 100-percent-owned production platforms in the Deepwater GOM, FM O&G has drilled 14 wells in producing fields with positive results, including the King D-10 well in fourth-quarter 2015. Four of these wells have been brought on production, including the King D-12 well in November 2015. FM O&G plans to complete and place six additional wells on production in 2016.Capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations totaled $3.0 billion in 2015 (including $2.5 billion incurred for Deepwater GOM and $0.2 billion for the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous natural gas trend), $3.2 billion for the year 2014 (including $2.1 billion incurred for the Deepwater GOM and $0.7 billion for the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous natural gas trend) and $1.45 billion for the seven-month period ending December 31, 2013 (including $0.4 billion incurred for Deepwater GOM and $0.2 billion for the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous natural gas trend). In response to market conditions, FM O&G is undertaking a near-term deferral of exploration and development expenditures by idling the three Deepwater GOM drillships it has under contract. FM O&G expects to incur idle rig costs associated with its drillship contracts totaling $0.6 billion in 2016 and $0.4 billion in 2017. Excluding amounts for idle rig costs, capital expenditures for oil and gas operations for the year 2016 are estimated to total $1.5 billion, with approximately 85 percent of the capital budget expected to be directed to the GOM. Refer to MD&A for further discussion of FM O&G's current exploration and development activities.Production and Sales Data Following presents summary oil and gas production and sales data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the seven-month period ending December 31, 2013: Years Ended December 31, Seven Months Ended  2015 2014 December 31, 2013 GOMa,b      Oil (MBbls) 22,161 19,681 11,364 Natural gas (MMcf)35,878c 28,700 17,231 NGLs (MBbls)2,209 2,027 1,049 MBOE30,350 26,491 15,286        California      Oil (MBbls)12,935 13,732 7,977 Natural gas (MMcf)2,154c 2,368c 1,318c NGLs (MBbls)166 171 97 MBOE13,460 14,298 8,293        Haynesville/Madden/Other      Oil (MBbls)158 222 83 Natural gas (MMcf)51,626 42,364 26,782 NGLs (MBbls)50 35 27 MBOE8,812 7,318 4,574        Eagle Fordd      Oil (MBbls)— 6,481 7,206 Natural gas (MMcf)— 7,410 8,844 NGLs (MBbls)— 978 1,244 MBOE— 8,694 9,924        Total U.S. oil and gas operations      Oil (MBbls)35,254 40,116 26,630 Natural gas (MMcf)89,658 80,842 54,175 NGLs (MBbls)2,425 3,211 2,417 MBOE52,622 56,801 38,077 Average cost per BOE:      Production costse$17.14 $18.00 $15.18 Production and ad valorem taxes1.45 2.08 1.96 Cash production costsf$18.59 $20.08 $17.14 a.Includes properties in the Deepwater GOM and on the Shelf, including the Inboard Lower Tertiary /Cretaceous natural gas trend.b.Horn Mountain represented 17 percent of our proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2015.

Oil and Gas ReservesAll of our estimated proved and probable reserves are based upon reserve reports prepared by Netherland, Sewell, & Associates, Inc. (NSAI) and Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering firms. A copy of the independent petroleum engineering firms' reserve reports are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form 10-K. Our reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC as prescribed by Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. FM O&G's technical staff estimates, with reasonable certainty, the economically producible oil and gas. The practices for estimating hydrocarbons in place include, but are not limited to, mapping, seismic interpretation of two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional data, core analysis, mechanical properties of formations, thermal maturity, well logs of existing penetrations, correlation of known penetrations, decline curve analysis of producing locations with significant production history, well testing, static bottom hole testing, flowing bottom hole pressure analysis and pressure and rate transient analysis.Internal Control and Qualifications of Third Party Engineers and Internal Staff. The technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at NSAI and Ryder Scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Both NSAI and Ryder Scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and petrophysicists; neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis. FM O&G's internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to NSAI and Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Throughout each fiscal year, FM O&G internal technical staff meets with representatives of the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates. FM O&G provides historical information to the independent reserve engineers, including ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. The NSAI and Ryder Scott reserve reports are reviewed with representatives of NSAI and Ryder Scott and FM O&G's internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. Additionally, FM O&G's senior management reviews the NSAI and Ryder Scott reserve reports.The internal reservoir engineering staff are supervised by FM O&G's Vice President of Engineering, who has 39 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis. This individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir engineering staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to NSAI and Ryder Scott for the year-end oil and gas reserves estimation process. The preparation of proved oil and gas reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include (i) the review and verification of historical production data; (ii) the review by FMO&G’s Vice President of Engineering of annually reported proved reserves, including the review of significant reserve changes and new proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves additions; (iii) the direct reporting responsibilities by FM O&G’s Vice President of Engineering to FM O&G’s President and Chief Operating Officer; (iv) the verification of property ownership by FM O&G’s land department; and (v) no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves reported.Proved Reserves. Our proved reserve volumes have been determined in accordance with SEC guidelines, which require the use of an average price, calculated as the twelve-month historical average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives. Our reference prices for reserve determination are the WTI spot price for crude oil and the Henry Hub price for natural gas, which were $50.28 per barrel of oil and $2.59 per MMBtu of natural gas at December 31, 2015. These prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual escalations. In accordance with the guidelines and  45Table of Contentsexcluding the impact of derivative instruments, the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of December 31, 2015, were $47.80 per barrel of oil and $2.55 per Mcf of natural gas.  The scope and results of procedures employed by NSAI and Ryder Scott are summarized in their reserve reports. For purposes of reserve estimation, we and the independent petroleum engineers use technical and economic data including well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. Our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods. Standard engineering and geoscience methods were used, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which we and the independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. A significant portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations and are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and gas that FM O&G ultimately recovers. Proved reserves represent quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. The following table presents our estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2015, all of which are located in the U.S.:  Proved Oil and Gas Reserves   Estimated at December 31, 2015   Oila Gas Total   (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBOE) Proved Developed:       GOM 59 116 78 California 69 12 71 Haynesville/Madden/Other 1 117 20   129 245 169 Proved Undeveloped:       GOM 65 29 70 California 13 — 13   78 29 83 Total Proved Reserves 207 274 252 a.  Includes 9 MMBbls of NGL proved reserves, consisting of 6 MMBbls of proved developed and 3 MMBbls of proved undeveloped.At December 31, 2015, we have an estimated total proved reserve life of 4.7 years and a proved developed reserve life of 3.2 years. At December 31, 2015, total proved oil and gas reserves were 252 MMBOE, including 83 MMBOE of PUD reserves. With the exception of one planned sidetrack development well in one of our Deepwater GOM properties that cannot be executed until the current producing well depletes, 98 percent of our PUD reserves are scheduled for development within five years, and $1.6 billion (or 97 percent) of our estimated future PUD capital is associated with the development of those reserves. Total estimated PUD reserves of 83 MMBOE at December 31, 2015, decreased from estimated PUD reserves of 144 MMBOE at December 31, 2014, reflecting downward revisions of 72 MMBOE primarily related to lower oil and gas price realizations. These revisions were partly offset by increases of 11 MMBOE primarily associated with the continued development of our Deepwater GOM properties. At December 31, 2014, FM O&G had 1,176 PUD locations, including 132 injector wells, of which 122 PUD locations (with associated proved reserves of 28 MMBOE) were scheduled to be drilled during 2015. During 2015, FM O&G invested $0.6 billion to drill and complete 35 PUD locations, which resulted in converting 1 MMBOE from PUD reserves to proved developed reserves.  Of the remaining 87 PUD locations scheduled to be drilled in 2015, 81 locations (with associated proved reserves of 3 MMBOE) were eliminated based on the current price environment,  46Table of Contents4 locations (with associated proved reserves of 17 MMBOE) were drilled and are expected to be completed in 2016 and 2017, and 2 locations (with associated proved reserves of 7 MMBOE) were delayed to future periods.At December 31, 2015, FM O&G had 186 PUD locations, including 4 injector wells. During 2016, 33 of these PUD locations (including 2 injector wells) with associated proved reserves of 35 MMBOE are scheduled to be developed.During 2015, FM O&G participated in 37 gross exploratory wells, of which 33 were successful, and 26 gross development wells, of which 24 were successful (refer to "Drilling Activities"). The following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows (standardized measure) at December 31, 2015 (in millions):Estimated undiscounted future net cash flows before income taxes $1,638Present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (PV-10)a,b $1,392Discounted future income taxesc —Standardized measure (refer to Note 21) $1,392   a.  In accordance with SEC guidelines, estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. Refer to discussion above for pricing used in our reserve reports at December 31, 2015.b.  The present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (PV-10) is not considered a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carryforwards and other factors. We believe investors use our PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under U.S. GAAP.c.  Future tax deductions are expected to be sufficient to fully offset future taxable income, resulting in no future income tax obligation at December 31, 2015.Refer to Note 21 for further discussion of our proved reserves.Probable Reserves. All of our probable oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2015, are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firm of NSAI. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves, but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves, probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. Undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain, economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped, except that they are not expected to be developed within five years, are classified as probable reserves.  47Table of ContentsThe following table presents our estimated probable oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2015:  Probable Oil and Gas Reserves   Estimated at December 31, 2015   Oila Gas Total   (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBOE) Probable Developedb:       GOM 20 45 27 California 5 — 5   25 45 32 Probable Undeveloped:       GOM 65 29 70 California 27 2 27   92 31 97 Total Probable Reserves 117 76 129         a.

One or more completions in the same well bore are considered one well. If any well in which one of the multiple completions is an oil completion, such well is classified as an oil well. At December 31, 2015, we owned interests in five gross wells containing multiple completions. 48Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors. This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; cash production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE); operating cash flows; capital expenditures; debt reduction initiatives; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt, crude oil and natural gas price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments; and share purchases and sales. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:Financial risksDeclines in the market prices of copper, gold and oil have adversely affected our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained or intensified, may adversely affect our ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and oil have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock.Our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and oil, and to a lesser extent molybdenum, silver, cobalt and natural gas. As described below, during 2015 and in early 2016, copper and oil prices declined significantly. If low prices persist or decline further, they may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations; and may continue to depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.In response to lower commodities prices, we have announced revised operating plans that incorporate significant reductions in capital spending, production curtailments at certain North and South America mines and actions to reduce operating, exploration and administrative costs, which may not achieve all the results we anticipate. If market prices for our primary commodities continue to decline or persist at low levels, we may have to further revise our operating plans, including curtailing production further, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur additional losses, and those losses may be material. We are also pursuing asset sales and joint venture arrangements to raise proceeds for debt reduction. We may be unable to receive favorable terms for asset sales or joint venture arrangements in the current market environment, which may prevent us from achieving our desired debt reduction levels.Fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and tax policies; commodities investment activity and speculation; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology.In particular, copper prices may be affected by demand from China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. Copper prices have declined significantly during 2015, with London Metal Exchange (LME) spot copper prices averaging $3.11 per pound in 2014 and $2.49 per pound in 2015. On December 31, 2015, the LME spot copper price was $2.13 per pound. Copper prices weakened further in early 2016 with the LME spot copper price ranging from $1.96 per pound to $2.13 per pound from January 1, 2016, to February 19, 2016. The decline in prices during 2015 resulted in non-cash charges for copper and molybdenum inventory adjustments ($338 million) and long-lived mining asset impairments ($37 million), as more fully discussed in Notes 4 and 5. Copper prices at or below the December 31, 2015, level could result in additional inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived mining assets. Other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine production costs. 49Table of ContentsFactors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world’s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. The London PM gold price averaged $1,160 per ounce in 2015 and $1,266 per ounce in 2014, and was $1,062 per ounce on December 31, 2015.Crude oil prices have been and could be affected in the future by continued development of shale reserves through hydraulic fracturing, actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producing nations, political and weather conditions in oil producing regions, transportation and refinery capacity, the amount of foreign imports of oil into the U.S., and the impact of legislation adopted in December 2015 lifting 40-year old restrictions on exporting U.S. oil. Oil prices have declined significantly since mid-2014, with Brent crude oil prices averaging $99.45 per barrel in 2014 and $53.64 per barrel in 2015. On December 31, 2015, the Brent crude oil price was $37.28. In early 2016, oil prices weakened further to multi-year lows in response to excess global supplies and relatively weak economic conditions with Brent crude oil prices ranging from $27.88 per barrel to $37.22 per barrel from January 1, 2016, to February 19, 2016. As further discussed in Note 1 and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), lower oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas prices, were a significant contributing factor to the non-cash impairment charges totaling $13.1 billion for the year 2015 and $3.7 billion for the year 2014 to write-down the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties.As further described in Note 1, under full cost accounting rules, a "ceiling test" is conducted each quarter to review the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties for impairment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices be used to determine the ceiling test limitation. Using West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as the reference oil price, the average price was $50.28 per barrel at December 31, 2015, compared with $94.99 per barrel at December 31, 2014. If the twelve-month historical average price remains below the December 31, 2015, twelve-month average of $50.28 per barrel, the ceiling test limitation will decrease potentially resulting in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties. The WTI spot oil price was $29.64 per barrel at February 19, 2016.In addition to declines in the trailing twelve-month average oil and natural gas prices, other factors that could result in future impairment of our oil and gas properties, include costs transferred from unevaluated properties to the full cost pool without corresponding proved oil and natural gas reserve additions, negative reserve revisions and the future incurrence of exploration, development and production costs. At December 31, 2015, carrying costs for unevaluated properties were $4.8 billion. These costs will be transferred into the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or if impairment is determined. If these activities do not result in additions to discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves at least equal to the related costs transferred (net of related tax effects), ceiling test impairments may occur. During 2015, we transferred $6.4 billion of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool mostly reflecting impairment of the carrying values of unevaluated properties.Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.At December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt was $20.4 billion (see Note 8) and our total consolidated cash was $224 million. We also have various other financial commitments, including for reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. Our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:•Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate;•Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•Limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; •Requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or•Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments. 50Table of ContentsOn February 26, 2016, we reached agreement with our bank group to amend our revolving credit facility and term loan. The changes pursuant to the revolving credit facility and the term loan included modifications of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest expense coverage ratio to provide us with additional flexibility, and the commitment under our revolving credit facility has been reduced by $500 million from $4.0 billion to $3.5 billion. A springing collateral and guarantee trigger was added to the revolving credit facility and term loan. Under this provision, if we have not entered into definitive agreements for asset sales totaling $3.0 billion in aggregate by June 30, 2016, that are reasonably expected to close by December 31, 2016, we will be required to secure the revolving credit facility and term loan with a mutually acceptable collateral and guarantee package. If such asset sales totaling $3.0 billion in aggregate have not occurred by December 31, 2016, then the springing collateral and guarantee trigger will go into effect. Refer to Notes 8 and 18 for further information about the revolving credit facility and term loan.    Any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our cash flow would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default. Since August 2015 and through January 5, 2016, we sold 210 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $9.47 per share under at-the-market equity programs that generated approximately $2 billion in gross proceeds.  We may seek to raise additional equity capital to fund operations, reduce debt or improve our financial position, which may have a negative impact to our stock price. For additional information, see Note 10.As of February 24, 2016, our senior unsecured debt was rated "BB" with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s (S&P), "BBB-" with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and "B1" with a negative outlook by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody's). There is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. For more information, refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas operations.Our strategic review of the oil and gas business and evaluation of other transactions may not result in increased stockholder value.Our Board of Directors (the Board) is undertaking a strategic review of alternatives for our oil and gas business. We and our advisors are actively engaged with interested parties in a process to evaluate opportunities that include asset sales and joint venture arrangements that would generate cash proceeds for debt repayment. We are also evaluating transactions involving certain of our mining assets. These initiatives may not result in transactions or other events that will lead to debt reduction or an increase in stockholder value. Mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations, and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations. Changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.We are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or equivalent state regulations. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations. With respect to our mining operations, most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction. Currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under CERCLA, but in August 2014, several environmental organizations initiated litigation against the EPA to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under CERCLA governing the hard rock mining industry. The EPA and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for approval. Notwithstanding industry objections, the court approved the agreement on January 29, 2016, thereby requiring the EPA to propose financial assurance  51Table of Contentsregulations for the hard rock mining industry by December 1, 2016, and to provide notice of its final action by December 1, 2017. The Court also ruled that the EPA has no obligation to promulgate rules at all and has until the end of 2016 to decide whether or not to proceed. It is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations or the extent to which they will supplement or replace state requirements. Any new regulations may, however, be financially material and adverse.We are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws. For example, permits, bonding and insurance are required to drill, operate, and plug and abandon wells. Financial responsibility requirements are also required under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill.In order to cover the various obligations of lessees operating in federal waters, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulatory standards sufficient to obtain a waiver from the requirement to post supplemental bonds, or post such bonds or other acceptable assurances that those obligations will be satisfied. Although we are currently exempt from the requirement to post security under the current rules, we may be required to post security under these rules if the BOEM determines we are no longer eligible for the exemption, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In August 2014, the BOEM issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which the agency indicated that it was considering changing the financial assurance requirements, and it currently plans to publish a revised notice in 2016. Among other things, the Notice states that the BOEM intends to revise its supplemental bonding procedures to eliminate waivers from the requirement to post security. Substantial changes to BOEM’s financial assurance requirements, including a requirement to post significant amounts of security in the form of bonds or similar assurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. The cost for bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases. Our failure to provide financial assurance, or failure to do the same by our co-lessees, could result in BOEM or the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) suspending or terminating operations on affected leases, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, our financial assurance obligations associated with closure, reclamation and remediation of mining sites, and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately $2.6 billion, and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by FCX and FM O&G guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. As a result of the downgrade of the credit ratings of our debt below investment grade by S&P's and Moody’s, we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. These other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations.Refer to Notes 1 and 12, for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations.International risksOur international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S.We are a U.S.-based natural resources company with substantial mining assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the U.S., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. Risks of conducting business in countries outside of the U.S. include:•Renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts;•Expropriation or nationalization of property;•Changes in another country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, which  52Table of Contentsbecause of rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment;•Political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;•Changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs;•Foreign exchange controls and movements in foreign currency exchange rates; and •The risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. Our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and  financial condition. Our international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. There has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years, and a steadily increasing focus on enforcement of those laws continues. Any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the Indonesian and Peruvian tax authorities (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these matters). Other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.Because our Grasberg mining operations in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in Indonesia.Our mining operations in Indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) pursuant to a Contract of Work (COW) with the Indonesian government. Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among Indonesia's most significant business enterprises. Partially because of their significance to Indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the Indonesian press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. For further discussion of the history of PT-FI's COW, refer to Note 13.The initial term of PT-FI's COW expires in 2021, but the COW explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. PT-FI has been engaged in discussions with officials of the Indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its COW, including extending the term of the COW. Notwithstanding provisions in the COW prohibiting it from doing so, the Indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts, including PT-FI’s COW, to address provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009, and mining regulations adopted thereunder, including matters with respect to the size of contract concessions, government revenues, domestic processing of minerals, divestment, provision of local goods and services, conversion from a COW to a licensing framework for extension periods, and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a COW’s expiration.  Regulations published in January 2014 imposed, among other things, a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricts concentrate exports after January 12, 2017. Despite PT-FI’s rights under its COW to  53Table of Contentsexport concentrate without the payment of duties, PT-FI was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-January 2014 through July 2014. In July 2014, PT-FI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Indonesian government. Under the MOU, PT-FI provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to increase royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties (which were set at 7.5 percent, declining to 5.0 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 7.5 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent). The MOU also anticipated an amendment of the COW within six months to address other matters; however, no terms of the COW other than those relating to the smelter bond, increased royalties and export duties were changed. In January 2015, the MOU was extended to July 25, 2015, and it expired on that date. The increased royalty rates, export duties and smelter assurance bond remain in effect. PT-FI is required to apply for renewal of export permits at six-month intervals. On July 29, 2015, PT-FI's export permit was renewed through January 28, 2016. In connection with the renewal, export duties were reduced to 5.0 percent, as a result of smelter development progress. On February 9, 2016, PT-FI's export permit was renewed through August 8, 2016. PT-FI will continue to pay a 5.0 percent export duty on concentrate while it reviews its smelter progress with the Indonesian government.As of December 31, 2015, we owned 90.64 percent of PT-FI, and the remaining 9.36 percent was owned by the Indonesian government.  Upon completion of an amended COW, which has not yet occurred, we and PT-FI have agreed to divest to the Indonesian national or local governments and/or Indonesian nationals up to a 30 percent interest (an additional 20.64 percent) in PT-FI at fair market value.PT-FI is engaged in active discussions with the Indonesian government regarding an amended COW. The revisions to the COW are expected to result in additional costs for our Indonesian operations.  We cannot predict whether we will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of our long-term mining rights. It has been difficult to get firm or final commitments from the Indonesian government. As a result, the outcome of these discussions remains uncertain. If we are unable to reach agreement with the government on our long-term rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in our underground development projects, which would materially and adversely affect future production and reserves. In addition, we cannot predict whether our applications for renewal of export permits, which are required at six-month intervals, will be granted on a timely basis or whether we will be permitted to export concentrate after August 8, 2016. Recent media reports have indicated that the Indonesia government is considering revisions to the 2009 Mining Law. It is unclear how any such changes would impact our current negotiations with the Indonesian government related to the extension and amendment of the COW, smelter development, export permits and other significant issues.Indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military. In addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations.In 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. The shooting incidents have continued on a sporadic basis with the last incident occurring on January 1, 2015. During this time, there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. To date, no one person or group has claimed responsibility for the shootings. The safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesian government to address security issues. The investigation of these incidents is ongoing. We also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys. We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our Indonesian operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time. For further discussion of labor disruptions at PT-FI, refer to the operational risk factor "Labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects."  54Table of ContentsWe will not mine all of our ore reserves in Indonesia before the initial term of our COW expires.The initial term of PT-FI's COW expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the COW cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current COW. Prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 21 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2015, representing 27 percent of PT-FI's share of recoverable copper reserves and 38 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves. There can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approve our COW extensions. For further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "Because our Grasberg minerals district is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in Indonesia."PT-FI's COW may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel.PT-FI's COW was entered into under Indonesia's 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. The COW may be subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.Recently adopted Indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the COW. Although the COW grants to PT-FI the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the COW, government agencies have sought and may continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on PT-FI that could affect exploration and operating requirements. For further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "Because our Grasberg minerals district is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in Indonesia." At times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the Indonesian government prior to May 1998 (i.e., during the Suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including PT-FI's COW, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the COW will not be challenged for political or other reasons.PT-FI's COW requires that disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Accordingly, if a dispute arises under the COW, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory. Additionally, our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending, and such a dispute could be pending for years.The Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) minerals district is located in the Southeast region of the DRC, and may be adversely affected by security risks and political, economic and social instability in the DRC.Since gaining independence in 1960, the DRC has undergone outbreaks of violence, changes in national leadership and financial crises. The DRC held its first democratic elections in 2006. President Joseph Kabila, elected in 2006 and currently serving his second five-year term, is not eligible under the DRC constitution for reelection. The next presidential election is scheduled to be held in November 2016 but recent reports indicate that the government may delay the elections, which could lead to additional unrest. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. As part of a review of all mining contracts by the Ministry of Mines (the Ministry) in the DRC, in February 2008, we received notification that the Ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A.'s (TFM) mining contracts. In October 2010, the DRC government concluded its review of TFM's existing mining contracts and confirmed that they were in good standing. In connection with the review, several amendments were made to TFM’s mining contracts and governing documents, and in March 2012, FCX's effective ownership in TFM was reduced from 57.75 percent to 56 percent.  55Table of ContentsPolitical, economic, social and security risks in the DRC are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business. These risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties with limited effective recourse through the courts; exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery; unwarranted attempts to increase taxes or make claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials, including retroactive claims; administrative disputes; security risks resulting from political instability; risks associated with illegal mining activity on Tenke's concession; and risk of loss because of civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism.In addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the DRC, there have been acts of violence in the Southeast region of the DRC where the Tenke minerals district is located. The safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority, and TFM works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues; however, no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact Tenke's operations.Accordingly, our Tenke operations and future development activities at the Tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could interrupt TFM’s operations or future development activities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Operational risksOur mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business.Our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, and other natural disasters; equipment failures; accidents; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates. The waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. We maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large dams that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. The failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life, and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective, safe management of all those facilities. The importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized recently by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life.Our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures, as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides and hurricanes. Our operations in California, including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of Los Angeles, are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury, property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern California. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and Gulf Coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes. Any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous substances into the air, soil, water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage, lost production and revenue, remediation and clean-up costs and liability for damages, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance.  56Table of ContentsLabor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As of December 31, 2015, 48 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and 4 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that expired in 2015 and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2016, including the agreement covering employees at our El Abra mine in Chile. None of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement. Labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. Refer to Items 1. and 2., "Business and Properties," for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. We could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts which could adversely affect our operations. For example, our PT-FI operations were affected by work stoppages in 2011 and during first-quarter 2012. In October 2014, a large percentage of Grasberg open-pit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts, notwithstanding approval of resumption of operations by Indonesian authorities upon completion of their investigation of a fatal haul truck accident that occurred near the Grasberg open pit. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies. Our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Most of our North and South America mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. In Arizona, where our operations use both surface and ground water, we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state's largest river systems, which primarily affect our Morenci, Safford, Sierrita and Miami mines. The adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to "reasonable use." However, court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation, as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims, which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings.Water for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation. As a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our Cerro Verde operations. In January 2016, the Peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the Rio Chili Basin because of drought conditions. As a result, the Cerro Verde water rights from the Rio Chili were temporarily decreased by 18 percent beginning in February 2016. The Peruvian government will continue to evaluate supply availability in the subsequent months dependent on monthly precipitation. Water for our El Abra mining operation in Chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. The agreement to  57Table of Contentspump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping.  If impact occurs, we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could affect production from El Abra. Although we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesian operations, lower rainfall resulting from El Niño weather conditions in the second half of 2015 has impacted operations and may continue to impact operations in 2016.Although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings, the outcome of which we cannot predict, and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain. The loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia and Africa mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and, in Indonesia, unusually difficult terrain.The Grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.Underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in May 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at PT-FI when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed. PT-FI temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the Grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities on June 24, 2013, and underground operations on July 9, 2013. No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.The Tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the DRC and is subject to challenges, such as severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance; limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained; difficulties in attracting and retaining experienced personnel; security risks; and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria, cholera and HIV. Additionally, because of limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the Tenke minerals district approximately 1,900 miles to ports in South Africa. The Tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect its contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development.We must continually replace reserves depleted by production, but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.Our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. Because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations, our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our long-term success. Our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our business and prospects.Development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate $3.4 billion for 2016, including $1.9 billion from the mining business (reflecting $1.4 billion for major projects primarily for underground development activities at Grasberg and remaining costs for the Cerro Verde expansion and $0.5 billion for sustaining capital) and $1.5 billion for oil and gas operations.  58Table of ContentsThere are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines, wells, or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics. New development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. The actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Operations in the Deepwater GOM present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore. In addition, our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultra-deep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional GOM Shelf and onshore Gulf Coast prospects. The Deepwater GOM presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity, water depth and higher drilling and development costs. For example, in April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, an unaffiliated offshore drilling rig located in the Deepwater GOM, sank following an explosion and fire, resulting in fatalities and the discharge of substantial amounts of oil into the GOM until mid-July 2010 when the flow of oil was finally stopped. The U.S. Department of Interior imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling from May through October 2010 and also issued a series of rules and notices to lessees and operators imposing new and more stringent regulatory safety and performance requirements and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in the Deepwater GOM, all of which significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the GOM and resulted in increased costs. The Deepwater GOM also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters, which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability, thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations. Our operations are subject to extensive regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. These regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations.Our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a natural resource company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. For additional information, see "Environmental risks." We are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. In the U.S., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred. If such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. Our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require, among other things, permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill, operate and plug and abandon wells, and that regulate the safety of our pipelines. Our U.S. offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the BOEM/BSEE, which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration, drilling, development and production plans. Under certain circumstances BOEM/BSEE may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases. Many other governmental bodies regulate our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the  59Table of Contentscorruption of data. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Environmental risksOur operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities.Our operations, both in the U.S. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including oil spill cleanup; mine closures and reclamation; well plug and abandonment requirements; protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations. Our Miami, Arizona smelter processes 44 percent of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. EPA regulations require us to invest in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of Arizona to demonstrate compliance with EPA's SO2 ambient air quality standards. The deadline for the smelter to install the SO2 pollution control equipment to comply with the regional haze rules is January 1, 2018. The Arizona rules for complying with the national ambient air quality standards are still being developed by state regulators and are subject to EPA approval, and it is not clear when they will become effective, but it is possible that they will be effective prior to January 1, 2018. We expect capital expenditures for this project (to meet both regulatory requirements) to total approximately $250 million, and we expect those expenditures to be made through 2018. If these expenditures are delayed or deferred for technical, financial or any other reasons, we may be forced to curtail production at the Miami smelter, which would require us to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid that would otherwise be generated during the smelting process, which would result in increased production costs.Laws such as CERCLA and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. As discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and certain of its affiliates. Some of our onshore California oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years, and legal requirements may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors. New or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above. In addition, in 2015, the EPA promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as "hazardous waste" under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements. These rules are currently being challenged by multiple parties in court; however, if the legal challenges are unsuccessful, the reclassification of certain mineral processing materials as “hazardous waste’” could materially increase costs at our U.S. copper and molybdenum processing facilities.The EPA also recently adopted rules that bring remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” that are protected by the Clean Water Act, thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land uses, and is in many ways aggressively attempting to expand its regulatory authority over air quality, water quality and solid wastes, among other things. Regulations are also being considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning, and to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing.  60Table of ContentsAdoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. In February 2016, the Department of the Interior's Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of "critical habitat" and "destruction or adverse modification," both of which are integral to the FWS's implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which protects federally-listed endangered and threatened species. The new rules increase FWS's discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future, or that are occasionally used by protected species. The new rules may limit the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations.During 2015, we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of $421 million, compared with $405 million in 2014 and $595 million in 2013. For 2016, we expect to incur approximately $495 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.We incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years.FMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. With the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. At December 31, 2015, we had more than 100 active remediation projects (including damaged natural resource claims) in 26 U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties, which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and which from time to time become the source of claims against us.At December 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities. Our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon: •Our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago; •Our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and •Our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.  61Table of ContentsSignificant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. In addition, remediation standards imposed by the EPA and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.Mining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. In addition, overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area; this additional material, while predicted in our environmental studies, could influence the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary.From time to time, certain Indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.Many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and, therefore, contribute to climate change. Carbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, and our revenues include sales of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and other carbon-based energy products. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. As a result of the Paris Agreement reached during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, a number of governments have pledged "Nationally Determined Contributions" to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the EPA has finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing power plants. While these rules are being challenged in court, increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs and may also affect the demand for the oil and gas we produce.  62Table of ContentsOther risksOur holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders’ ability to receive dividends.We are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. Cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, to repay any subordinated loan we may make to such subsidiary unless specified conditions are met, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders. Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:•Authorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;•Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;•Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and•Require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.Item 1B
