ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this document. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting us, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.Risks Relating to Our BusinessGeneral global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products.We compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world. Among these, the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets. Many of our businesses have experienced periodic economic downturns. Important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy, industrial and governmental capital spending, the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets, unemployment rates, availability of consumer and commercial financing, interest rates, and energy and commodity prices. While we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions, any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition, which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products.The markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive. We compete against large and well-established national and global companies, as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers. We compete based on technical expertise, reputation for quality and reliability, timeliness of delivery, previous installation history, contractual terms and price. Some of our competitors, in particular smaller companies, attempt to compete based primarily on price, localized expertise and local relationships, especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise. In addition, during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price. If we are unable to continue to differentiate our products, services and solutions, or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products, services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.We operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery. We compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours, or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate. Also, in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers, in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses. Accordingly, our future success depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our products, services, organization, workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world, particularly in high growth emerging markets; identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end-markets; and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and cost-effectively. We have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies, but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets. The failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.We continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings. There can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful. Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:6•diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;•difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;•difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses;•inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;•potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of ours;•assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including risks related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”); and•dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities.It may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations. Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.We are exposed to political, regulatory, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.Sales outside of the United States for the year ended December 31, 2013 accounted for 54 percent of our net sales. Further, most of our businesses obtain some products, components and raw materials from Non-U.S. suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:•changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;•relatively more severe economic conditions in some international markets than in the United States;•the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;•the difficulty of communicating and monitoring standards and directives across our global network of after-market service centers and manufacturing facilities;•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions;•the possibility of terrorist action affecting us or our operations;•the threat of nationalization and expropriation;•the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in non-U.S. labor markets;•changes in tax treaties, laws or rulings that could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate;•limitations on repatriation of earnings;•the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign countries; and•changes in and required compliance with a variety of Non-U.S. laws and regulations.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole.Volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Sales outside of the United States for the year ended December 31, 2013 accounted for 54 percent of our net sales. Our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the principle non-U.S. currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations, and vice-versa. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances, may have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.7Our future revenue depends in part on the existence of and our ability to win new contracts for major capital projects.A significant portion of our revenue in Technical Solutions and Flow Technologies is derived from major capital projects, including water pipeline and desalination projects in Flow Technologies. The number of such projects we may win in any year fluctuates, and is dependent upon the general availability of such projects and our ability to bid successfully for them. If negative market conditions arise, fewer such projects may be available, and if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals we may not be able to pursue particular projects. Either condition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We maintain a sizable backlog and the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is uncertain. Our inability to convert backlog into revenue, whether due to factors that are within or outside of our control, could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.The timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays, many of which, including fluctuations in our customers’ delivery schedules, are beyond our control. This is especially true with respect to major global capital projects, where the extended timeline for project completion and invoice satisfaction increases the likelihood for delays in the conversion of backlog related to modifications and order cancellations. Such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations and cash flows from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis. Further, while we believe that historical order cancellations have not been significant, if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in orders, it would reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations.Material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations.In the past, we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses. We strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials (especially metals and resins), energy and other costs such as pension, health care and insurance. We continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity. Continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations.We are exposed to liquidated damages in many of our customer contracts.Many of our customer contracts contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with agreed terms, conditions and standards. Liquidated damages provisions typically provide for a payment to be made by us to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time. We generally try to limit our exposure to a maximum penalty within a contract. However, because our products are often components of large and complex systems or capital projects, if we incur liquidated damages they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.In certain industries and for certain applications, in particular with respect to our pressure relief valves and valves used in the nuclear power generation industry, we must obtain certifications for our products or installations by regulators or standards organizations. As we expand our products offering into emerging markets, we will need to comply with additional and potentially different certification requirements. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop, engineer and market our products.Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. Intellectual property protection, however, may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products. Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. Over the past few years, we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop, engineer and market our products. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.8We have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results.We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013 our goodwill and intangible assets were $6,910.3 million and represented 59% of our total assets. Long-term declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.In the fourth quarter of each year, we complete our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment reviews. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $11.0 million and $60.7 million for trade name intangibles in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. These represent impairments of a trade name in Technical Solutions in 2013 and trade names in Flow Technologies, Process Technologies and Technical Solutions in 2012. The impairment charges were the result of rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $200.5 million for goodwill in Process Technologies. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions and due to continued softness in the end-markets served by residential water treatment components.We may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force.As of December 31, 2013, 10,900 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor.Seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results.We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within Process Technologies, Flow Technologies and Technical Solutions. In Process Technologies, end-user demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. In Flow Technologies, demand for residential water supply products, infrastructure and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales increase in both Process Technologies and Flow Technologies is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Also in Flow Technologies, we generally experience increased demand during Australia’s prime agricultural seasons. Seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperatures, heavy flooding and droughts. Technical Solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. We cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our share price may fluctuate significantly.We cannot predict the prices at which our common shares may trade. The market price of our common shares may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;•success or failure of our business strategy;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•our ability to obtain third-party financing as needed;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•changes in earnings estimates by us or securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the operating and share price performance of other comparable companies;•investor perception of us;•natural or other environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;9•overall market fluctuations;•results from any material litigation, including asbestos claims, government investigations or environmental liabilities;•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business; and•general economic conditions and other external factors.Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance MattersOur subsidiaries are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our subsidiaries, along with numerous other companies, are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Historically, our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestos-related claims. We have experienced an increase in the number of asbestos-related lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims. A large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed or withdrawn. Our strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, only where appropriate, settling claims before trial. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately 2,000 lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries. A lawsuit might include several claims, and we have approximately 2,200 claims outstanding as of December 31, 2013. We cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and future claims, including related defense costs, based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies. These assumptions are derived from historical claims experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities. These assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate, and accordingly, we may incur additional liabilities in the future. A change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims. Although it is possible that we will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond what we have currently recorded, we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time. On an annual basis, we review, and update as appropriate, such estimated asbestos liabilities and assets and the underlying assumptions. Such an update could result in a material change in such estimated assets and liabilities.We also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities. There are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestos-related recoveries, such as policy triggers, policy or contract interpretation, success in litigation in certain cases, the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties. The assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate, and as a result, actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs. We believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond our estimation period, net of expected recoveries, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.10We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the United States.The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production, they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Prior to the Merger, the Flow Control business was subject to investigations by the DOJ and the SEC related to allegations that improper payments were made by the Flow Control business and other Tyco subsidiaries and third-party intermediaries in recent years in violation of the FCPA. Tyco reported to the DOJ and the SEC the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and Tyco’s own internal investigations. As a result of discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters, on September 24, 2012, Tyco entered into a settlement with the SEC and a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, pursuant to which the Flow Control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the DOJ concerning its continuing compliance efforts. As a result, the Flow Control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products, which are products that may have both civil and military applications, or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation, and are often subject to more stringent export controls. From time to time, we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. trade laws applicable to our products. However, even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies, we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries. When we receive information alleging improper activity, our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and business prospects.Legislative action by the U.S. Congress could adversely affect us.Legislative action could be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties, or modify tax statutes or regulation upon which we rely. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. If proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Switzerland or limiting our ability as a Swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between Switzerland and the United States, we could be subject to increased taxation, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods.We are exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities and litigation.We are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and Non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our environmental practices, public and worker health and safety, and the indoor and outdoor environment. Compliance with these environmental, health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities, increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer. We are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional 11permits that we may require. Compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.We have been named as defendant, target or a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) in a number of environmental clean-ups relating to our current or former business units. We have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.Certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. We have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties. The cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict. In addition, environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental clean-up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.We are exposed to potential regulatory, financial and reputational risks related to certain “conflict minerals."In 2012, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, as required by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rules impose inquiry, diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to “conflict minerals,” defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The first disclosure deadline under the final rules is May 31, 2014, and by that date, an SEC reporting company must make disclosures regarding products it sold in calendar 2013. Certain of these minerals are used extensively in components manufactured by our suppliers (or in components incorporated by our suppliers into components supplied to us) for use in our products. Under the final rules, an SEC reporting company must conduct a country of origin inquiry that is reasonably designed to determine whether any of the “conflict minerals” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by the company originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. If any such “conflict minerals” originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country, the final rules require the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source of such “conflict minerals” and their chain of custody with the ultimate objective of determining whether the “conflict minerals” directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. The issuer must then prepare and file with the SEC a report regarding its diligence efforts.  We have incurred and expect to incur significant costs to conduct our country of origin inquiry and, if necessary, to exercise such due diligence. We have a very large number of suppliers and our supply chain is very complex and multifaceted. While we have no intention to use minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries that are not “conflict free” (meaning that they do not contain “conflict minerals” that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country), a significant number of our suppliers are small businesses, and those small businesses have limited or no resources to track their sources of minerals. As a result, we expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products and disclosing that our products are “conflict free.” We may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products or if we are unable to disclose that our products are “conflict free.” Implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of “conflict minerals” capable of certification as “conflict free.” Accordingly, we may incur significant costs as a consequence of these rules, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations. To the extent our customers, particularly those involved in the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries, are subject to any of these or other similar 12proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated, which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services. In addition, new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels, including nuclear, wind, solar and bio-fuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency, could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services. These actions could also increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. Because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We are exposed to potential regulatory, financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data.We rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Pentair and its employees, customers, dealers and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain.  Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs.  We have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. To our knowledge, no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks. Should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.Our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation.Our businesses expose us to potential litigation, such as product liability claims relating to the design, manufacture and sale of our products. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims. Successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Relating to the Distribution and the MergerWe may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Merger.The benefits that are expected to result from the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the Merger. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses. Even if we are able to integrate the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses. While we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses.The integration of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses following the Merger may present significant challenges.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses. These difficulties include:•the challenge of integrating the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of each entity;•the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations;13•the challenge of integrating the business cultures of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses, which may prove to be incompatible;•the challenge and cost of integrating the information technology systems of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses; and•the potential difficulty in retaining key executives and personnel of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses.The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate the Pentair, Inc. and Flow Control businesses. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Distribution.In connection with the Distribution, we entered into a tax sharing agreement (the “2012 Tax Sharing Agreement”) with Tyco and The ADT Corporation (“ADT”), which governs the rights and obligations of ADT, Tyco and us for certain pre-Distribution tax liabilities, including Tyco's obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement (the “2007 Tax Sharing Agreement”) entered into by Tyco, Covidien Ltd. (“Covidien”) and TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity”) in connection with the 2007 distributions of Covidien and TE Connectivity by Tyco (the “2007 Separation”). The 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement governs the rights and obligations of Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity with respect to certain pre-2007 Separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 Separation. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. 2007 and prior income tax returns. In addition, in the event that the 2007 Separation or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 Separation by Tyco, Covidien or TE Connectivity, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or TE Connectivity as a result thereof. If none of the companies is responsible for such failure, then Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity would be responsible for such taxes, in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. The 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement provides that we, Tyco and ADT will share (i) certain pre-Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco's and ADT's U.S. income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement (the liabilities in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, “Shared Tax Liabilities”). Tyco is responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. We and ADT will share 42% and 58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. We, ADT and Tyco will share 20%, 27.5% and 52.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million. Costs and expenses associated with the management of Shared Tax Liabilities will generally be shared 20% by us, 27.5% by ADT and 52.5% by Tyco.With respect to years prior to and including the 2007 Separation, tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and which may require Tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority, Covidien or TE Connectivity. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although Tyco has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments, a few significant items remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, Tyco has not been able to resolve certain open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt issued during the period, through the IRS appeals process. The ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in Tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. On July 1, 2013, Tyco announced that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued Notices of Deficiency (“Tyco IRS Notices”) to Tyco asserting that several of Tyco's former U.S. subsidiaries collectively owe additional taxes in the aggregate amount of $883.3 million plus penalties of $154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of Tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time. These amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the IRS challenge to Tyco's tax filings as described below is ultimately successful. If the IRS should successfully assert its position, our share of the collective liability, if any, would be determined pursuant to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS assessments.As we have previously disclosed, in connection with U.S. federal tax audits of Tyco and its subsidiaries, the IRS has previously raised issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year. The adjustments now asserted by the 14IRS under the Tyco IRS Notices primarily relate to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS has asserted in the Tyco IRS Notices that substantially all of the intercompany debt originated during the 1997 - 2000 period  should not be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and has therefore disallowed interest and related deductions recognized associated with that intercompany debt on the U.S. income tax returns for those periods totaling approximately $2.9 billion. If the IRS is successful in asserting its claim, it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same Tyco intercompany debt in subsequent time periods, totaling approximately $6.6 billion, which Tyco has advised us that it expects the IRS to disallow. Under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including the Distribution. As mentioned above, Tyco has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS assessments.Any payment that Tyco is required to make under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, including if the IRS were to prevail with respect to the matter set forth above, could result in a material liability for us under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, and indirectly the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods. If the Merger, Distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders or Tyco could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Pentair, Inc. and Tyco received private letter rulings from the IRS in connection with the Distribution and the Merger regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution and the Merger to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: the Distribution will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares; certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the Code; the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code; certain anticipated post-closing transactions will not prevent the tax-free treatment of the Distribution or the Merger; and Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not cause the Merger to be taxable to Pentair, Inc. shareholders (except for a U.S. shareholder who is or will be a “five-percent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement with the IRS). In addition, Tyco received a legal opinion confirming the tax-free status of the Distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposesand Tyco and Pentair, Inc. received legal opinions to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not cause the Merger to be taxable to Pentair, Inc. shareholders (except for a U.S. shareholder who is or will be a “five-percent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement” with the IRS).The private letter rulings and opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco and Pentair, Inc. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution, the internal transactions or the Merger should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distribution, the internal transactions or the Merger should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in share or asset ownership after the Merger.If the Distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the Distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to Tyco shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Tyco shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Tyco would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares distributed to Tyco shareholders on the Distribution date over Tyco’s tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, Tyco could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution are taxable. If the Merger ultimately is determined to be taxable, Pentair, Inc. shareholders would recognize taxable gain or loss on their disposition of Pentair, Inc. common shares in the Merger.Under the terms of the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the Distribution, the ADT distribution, the internal transactions or the Merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the Distribution by us, ADT or Tyco, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof. If such failure is not the result of actions taken after the Distribution by us, ADT or Tyco, then we, ADT and Tyco would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we, ADT and Tyco are responsible for Shared Tax Liabilities. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that any party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay certain taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party’s fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party’s obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party’s taxes. In addition, if another party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be 15legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco’s and ADT’s tax liabilities.If the Distribution or the Merger are determined to be taxable for Swiss withholding or other tax purposes, we could incur significant Swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities.Generally, Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to Tyco’s shareholders, regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder. As of January 1, 2011, distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus (Kapitaleinlage) accumulated on or after January 1, 1997 are exempt from Swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met (Kapitaleinlageprinzip). Tyco has obtained a ruling from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirming that the Distribution qualifies as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by Tyco when making the Distribution.As a condition to closing of the Merger, Tyco obtained rulings from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirming: (i) that the Merger will be a transaction that is generally tax-free for Swiss federal, cantonal, and communal tax purposes (including with respect to Swiss stamp tax and Swiss withholding tax); (ii) the relevant Swiss tax base of an acquisition subsidiary of ours for Swiss tax (including federal and cantonal and communal) purposes; (iii) the relevant amount of capital contribution reserves (Kapitaleinlageprinzip) which will be exempt from Swiss withholding tax in the event of a distribution to our shareholders after the Merger; and (iv) that no Swiss stamp tax will be levied on certain post-Merger restructuring transactions.These tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from Tyco. Notwithstanding these tax rulings, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration could determine on audit that the Distribution or the Merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. If the Distribution or the Merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes, we and Tyco could incur material Swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities that could significantly detract from, or eliminate, the benefits of the Distribution and the Merger. In addition, we could become liable to indemnify Tyco for part of any Swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement.We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.Our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions or equity issuances could be significantly limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Distribution and certain related transactions. Even if the Distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level gain to Tyco under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our shares or Tyco’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution. Any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or Tyco’s shares within two years after the Distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Tyco may be able to rebut that presumption. For purposes of this test, the Merger might be treated as part of such a plan or series of related transactions, but if so would not, by itself, cause the Distribution to be taxable to Tyco since Pentair, Inc. shareholders acquired less than 50% of our common shares in the Merger. The change in ownership resulting from the Merger, if treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, would be aggregated with other acquisitions or issuances of our shares that occur as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution in determining whether a 50% change in ownership has occurred. The process for determining whether a change of ownership has occurred under the tax rules is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. If we do not carefully monitor our compliance with these rules, we could inadvertently cause or permit a change of ownership to occur, triggering our obligation to indemnify Tyco or ADT pursuant to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement.To preserve the tax-free treatment to Tyco of the Distribution, under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. Further, for the two-year period following the Distribution, without obtaining the consent of Tyco and ADT, a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm, we may be prohibited from, among other things:•approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than 35% of our common shares, when combined with any other changes in ownership of our common shares,•redeeming equity securities,•selling or otherwise disposing of more than 35% of our assets, or16•engaging in certain internal transactions.These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement also provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on Tyco or any of its affiliates or on ADT or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the Distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Distribution by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.Risks Relating to Our LiquidityDisruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us, our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit.In the normal course of our business, we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries. Although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs, our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets, which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable. These factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects, as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses. These disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects. One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.Our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants. Our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of credit facility lenders, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Furthermore, acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, and may decrease our profitability.As of December 31, 2013, we had $2.6 billion of total debt outstanding. We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares, the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common shares, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Also, regardless of the terms of our financings, the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the Distribution to be a taxable event for Tyco under Section 355(e) of the Code, and under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be required to indemnify Tyco for that tax. See discussion under “We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Distribution and the Merger because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.”Our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and 17interest on our indebtedness. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation in SwitzerlandOur status as a Swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.Swiss law allows shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval. This authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe to any new issuance of shares. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.Under Swiss law, a Swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years, or if the corporation has distributable reserves, each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are generally recorded either as “free reserves” or as “qualifying contributed surplus” (contributions received from shareholders) in “Capital contribution reserve.” Distributions may be made out of registered share capital—the aggregate par value of a company’s registered shares—only by way of a capital reduction. After the Merger, the amount available for future dividends or capital reductions from reserve from capital contributions on a Swiss withholding tax free basis is CHF 8.8 billion. We will not be able to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders on a Swiss withholding tax free basis in excess of that amount unless we increase our share capital or our reserves from capital contributions. We would also be able to pay dividends out of distributable profits or freely distributable reserves, but such dividends would be subject to Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient distributable profits, free reserves, reserves from capital contributions or registered share capital to pay a dividend or effect a capital reduction or that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for dividend payments or distributions as a result of capital reductions.Generally, Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders, regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder, unless the distribution is made to shareholders out of (i) a reduction of par value or (ii) assuming certain conditions are met, qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after January 1, 1997. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (the “U.S.-Swiss Treaty”) may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting shares, or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds). There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient qualifying contributed surplus to pay dividends free from Swiss withholding tax or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that the current Swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. There are currently motions pending in the Swiss Parliament that purport to limit the distribution of qualifying contributed surplus. In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions or qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.Under present Swiss tax laws, repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value except, since January 1, 2011, to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus (Kapitaleinlagereserven) if any. If, and to the extent that, the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves, the Swiss withholding tax becomes due. No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.Although we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a “second trading line” on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors sell shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without triggering Swiss withholding tax if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made 18out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that tax-free qualifying contributed surplus is attributable to the share repurchase.Changes in the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate could limit the amount of dividends authorized on our common shares, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to pay dividends on our common shares.On April 29, 2013, our shareholders approved at our 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders a proposal to pay quarterly cash dividends through the second quarter of 2014. The authorization provides that a dividend will be made out of our “contributed surplus” equity position in our statutory accounts to our shareholders in the amount of $0.25 for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and the first and second quarters of 2014. The deduction to our contributed surplus in our statutory accounts, which is required to be made in Swiss francs, will be determined based on the aggregate amount of the dividend and will be calculated based on the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate in effect on April 29, 2013. The U.S. dollar amount of the dividend will be capped at an amount such that the aggregate reduction to our contributed surplus will not exceed 396 million Swiss francs. To the extent that a dividend payment would exceed the cap, the U.S. dollar per share amount of the current or future dividends will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate amount of all dividends paid does not exceed the cap. In addition, the aggregate reduction in contributed surplus will be increased for any shares issued, and decreased for any shares acquired, after April 29, 2013 and before the record date for the applicable dividend payment. Any future dividends that may be proposed by our board of directors will be subject to approval by our shareholders at our annual general meeting. There can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve dividends. Whether our board of directors exercises its discretion to propose any dividends to holders of our common shares will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future. Swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.Because of differences between Swiss law and U.S. state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of Swiss companies and those incorporated in the U.S., it may not be possible to enforce in Switzerland court judgments obtained in the United States against us based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. As a result, in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, U.S. investors may find it difficult to:•effect service within the United States upon us or our directors and officers located outside the United States;•enforce judgments obtained against those persons in U.S. courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States; and•enforce against those persons in Switzerland, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, civil liabilities based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws.Original actions against persons in Switzerland based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws are governed, among other things, by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides that the application of provisions of non-Swiss law by the courts in Switzerland shall be precluded if the result was incompatible with Swiss public policy. Also, mandatory provisions of Swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply.Switzerland and the United States do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the United States in Switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a non-Swiss court may be enforced in Switzerland only if:•the non-Swiss court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law;•the judgment of such non-Swiss court has become final and non-appealable;•the judgment does not contravene Swiss public policy;•the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law; and•no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in Switzerland, or adjudicated in Switzerland, or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in Switzerland.19Risks Relating to Our Proposed RedomicileThe anticipated benefits of the Redomicile may not be realized.We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the Redomicile. Our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.The rights of Pentair shareholders will change as a result of the Redomicile.The completion of the Redomicile will change the governing law that applies to our shareholders from Swiss law (which applies to the Pentair common shares) to Irish law (which applies to Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares). Many of the principal attributes of Pentair common shares and Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares will be materially similar. However, if the Redomicile is completed, Pentair shareholders’ future rights as shareholders under Irish corporate law will differ from their current rights as a shareholder under Swiss corporate law. In addition, Pentair-Ireland’s proposed articles of association will differ from the Pentair articles of association and organizational regulations. A change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and taxes on dividends. Under current Irish legislation, a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in Ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in Ireland, or, in certain circumstances, if it is incorporated in Ireland. Under current U.K. legislation, a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. is regarded as resident in the U.K. for taxation purposes. Where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the U.K. and Ireland then the provisions of article 4(3) of the Double Tax Convention between Ireland and the U.K. provide that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. Upon completion of the Redomicile, Pentair-Ireland intends to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. and therefore has its tax residency only in the U.K. However, we cannot provide assurance that Pentair-Ireland will continue to be resident only in the U.K. for tax purposes. It is possible that in the future, whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of its affairs, Pentair-Ireland could become, or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the U.K. If Pentair-Ireland was considered to be a tax resident of Ireland, Pentair-Ireland could become liable for Irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.We will remain subject to changes in law and other factors after the Redomicile that may not allow Pentair-Ireland to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in Pentair’s industry.While we believe that the Redomicile should not affect our ability to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry, we cannot give any assurance as to what Pentair-Ireland’s effective tax rate will be after the Redomicile because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where Pentair operates. Also, the tax laws of the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in Pentair-Ireland’s worldwide effective corporate tax rate. In particular, legislative action could be taken by the U.S., the U.K., Ireland or the European Union which could override tax treaties upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect Pentair-Ireland’s effective tax rate. As a result, Pentair-Ireland’s actual effective tax rate may be materially different from our expectations.We expect to incur transaction costs in connection with the completion of the Redomicile, some of which will be incurred whether or not the Redomicile is completed.We incurred in 2013 and expect to incur in 2014 a total of approximately $14 million in transaction costs in connection with the Redomicile. A majority of these costs will be incurred regardless of whether the Redomicile is completed and prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting.Pentair-Ireland will seek Irish High Court approval of the creation of distributable reserves. Pentair-Ireland expects this will be forthcoming but cannot guarantee this. Under Irish law, dividends may only be paid (and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded) out of “distributable reserves,” which Pentair-Ireland will not have immediately following the closing of the Redomicile. The creation of distributable reserves of Pentair-Ireland by way of a capital reduction of Pentair-Ireland requires the approval of the Irish High Court and, in connection with seeking such court approval, we are asking Pentair shareholders to approve the creation of distributable reserves for Pentair-Ireland (through the reduction of the share premium account of Pentair-Ireland) at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The approval of the Irish High Court is expected within approximately six to ten weeks following the closing. We are not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves. However, the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court. There will also be no guarantee that the approval of the creation of distributable reserves for Pentair-Ireland by Pentair shareholders will be obtained. Approval of the creation of distributable reserves by the Irish High Court may also take substantially longer than Pentair-Ireland anticipates. In the event that distributable reserves of Pentair-Ireland are not created, no distributions by way of dividends, share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under Irish law until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities.20Transfers of Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.For the majority of transfers of Pentair-Ireland shares, there will not be any Irish stamp duty. However, Irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfers occurring after completion of the Redomicile. A transfer of Pentair-Ireland shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially (i.e. through The Depository Trust Company (the "DTC")) to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to Irish stamp duty (unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares). A transfer of Pentair-Ireland shares by a seller who holds shares directly (i.e. not through the DTC) to any buyer, or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. A shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through the DTC (or vice versa) without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to Pentair-Ireland’s transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of a sale of the shares.Because of the potential Irish stamp duty on transfers of Pentair-Ireland shares, we strongly recommend that all directly registered Pentair  shareholders open broker accounts so they can transfer their shares into a broker account as soon as possible, and in any event prior to completion of the Redomicile. We also strongly recommend that any person who wishes to acquire Pentair-Ireland shares after completion of the Redomicile acquire such shares through the DTC or another securities depository. Pentair-Ireland does not intend to pay any stamp duty on these transactions. However, Pentair-Ireland’s articles of association allow Pentair-Ireland, in its absolute discretion, to create an instrument of transfer and pay any stamp duty payable by a buyer. In the event of such payment, Pentair-Ireland reserves the right to (i) seek reimbursement from the buyer or seller (at its discretion), (ii) set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the buyer or seller (at its discretion) and/or (iii) claim a lien against the Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares on which it has paid stamp duty. Parties to a share transfer should not assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares will be paid by Pentair-Ireland. Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares, received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax. Irish capital acquisitions tax (“CAT”) could apply to a gift or inheritance of Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because Pentair-Ireland shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €225,000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. If Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of the DTC, then transactions in Pentair-Ireland’s securities may be disrupted.The facilities of the DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms.Upon the completion of the Redomicile, Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. Pentair-Ireland expects to enter into arrangements with the DTC whereby Pentair-Ireland will agree to indemnify the DTC for any stamp duty and/or Stamp Duty Reserve Tax that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for Pentair-Ireland’s ordinary shares.The DTC is not obligated to accept Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities at the closing and, even if the DTC does initially accept Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares, it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares. If the DTC determined prior to the completion of the Redomicile that Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for clearance within the DTC system, then we would not expect to complete the transactions contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus in their current form. However, if the DTC determined at any time after the completion of the Redomicile that Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and trading in Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares would be disrupted. While Pentair-Ireland would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Pentair-Ireland ordinary shares.The U.K.’s controlled foreign company legislation may apply to Pentair-Ireland.Pentair-Ireland is seeking confirmation from HM Revenue and Customs that either Pentair-Ireland will not be subject to the U.K.’s controlled foreign company (“CFC”) legislation because it does not satisfy the “gateway” test or that the rules have no material effect because any chargeable profits which pass through the “gateway” benefit from an applicable exemption.21Broadly the U.K.’s CFC rules may subject to U.K. corporation tax profits in non-U.K. tax resident subsidiaries which pass through a “gateway”. Although the rules are complex, profits of a non-U.K. tax resident company should not pass through the “gateway” unless the profits have been artificially diverted from the U.K.The rules should therefore not apply to ordinary trading activities outside the U.K. In relation to a finance company, if profits pass through the “gateway”, specific exemptions apply including the “matched interest” rules which broadly speaking will exempt profits from the U.K. CFC rules if U.K. members of Pentair-Ireland do not have net finance expenses as determined by the U.K.’s worldwide debt cap rules.Upon completion of the Redomicile, Pentair-Ireland intends to manage its affairs so that the U.K. CFC rules do not result in any material U.K. corporation tax liability. The treatment is intended to be discussed and agreed with HM Revenue and Customs, but if such agreement is not received and the U.K.’s CFC rules do indeed apply, this may adversely affect Pentair-Ireland’s effective tax rate.We may choose to abandon the Redomicile.We may decide to abandon the Redomicile at any time prior to the extraordinary general meeting of Pentair shareholders where we will seek shareholder approval of the Merger Agreement (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”), and in some circumstances, after obtaining shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting. After the Merger Agreement is approved by our shareholders, we anticipate filing the application to effect the Redomicile, unless one of the conditions to completing the Redomicile fails to be satisfied and such failure would have a material adverse effect on the Redomicile.ITEM 1B
