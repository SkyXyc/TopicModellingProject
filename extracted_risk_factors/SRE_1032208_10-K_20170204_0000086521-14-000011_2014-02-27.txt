ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

 





When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following occurs, our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially negatively impacted. In addition, the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in the Annual Report, including, without limitation, the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In this section, when we state that a risk or uncertainty may, could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may, could or will materially adversely affect us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may, could or will have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and/or the trading prices of our securities.

 

Sempra Energy’s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries.

 

Sempra Energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and, in the short term, its ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term, cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures and long-term debt obligations. In addition, the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, as a result of legislation, regulation, court order, contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress.

 

A significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by, and therefore held in, foreign jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the United States or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash, which reduces the cash available to us. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our United States operations, we may incur significant taxes and/or penalties to repatriate these funds.

 

Conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us.

 

Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.

 

The credit markets and financial services industry have experienced periods of extreme world-wide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and regulation.

 

Limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments. In difficult credit markets, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities. This could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding, both of which could significantly reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.

 

The availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. If the credit ratings of SoCalGas or SDG&E were to be reduced, their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in Sempra Energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of Sempra Energy and its non-utility subsidiaries. If the credit ratings of Sempra Energy or its non-utility subsidiaries were to decline, especially below investment grade, financing costs and borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

 

Sempra Energy has substantial investments in Mexico and South America which expose us to foreign currency, legal, tax, economic and management oversight risk.

 

Our foreign operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to fully mitigate with our actions. We have foreign operations in Mexico and South America. These risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses. Our international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and to geo-political uncertainties, which may be driven by changes in threat environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties, as well as U.S. foreign policy. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our revenue, costs or cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our primary currency exposures are to the Latin America currencies. Our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. We may attempt to offset material cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments. Because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in other comprehensive income caused by exchange rate fluctuations.

 

 

Risks Related to All Sempra Energy Subsidiaries

 

Our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation.

 

In recent years, the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes, on both federal and state levels. These changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses. Moreover, existing regulations, laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted, and new regulations, laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities. Special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs.

 

Our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements, and the regulations, laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs, and new tax legislation, regulations or other interpretations could materially adversely affect our tax expense. Changes in regulations, laws and tariffs and changes in the way regulations, laws and tariffs are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. 

 

Our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the California Utilities and other Sempra Energy operations. These rules are commonly referred to as the Affiliate Transaction Rules. These businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas, or to trade with the California Utilities and with each other. Affiliate Transaction Rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the CPUC before entering into any such transactions with the California Utilities. Any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the LNG terminals, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Our businesses require numerous permits, licenses and other governmental approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits, licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

All of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals. The acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of LNG terminals, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. Once received, approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation. In addition, permits, licenses, certificates, and other approvals may be modified or rescinded by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, or we may be forced to incur additional costs. Any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline, and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Our California Utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as The Utility Reform Network (TURN), Utility Consumers’ Action Network (UCAN) and other stakeholder and advocacy groups. Operations that may be influenced by these groups include

 





§  


the rates charged to our customers;




 





§  


our ability to site and construct new facilities;




 





§  


our ability to purchase or construct generating facilities;




 





§  


safety;




 





§  


the issuance of securities;




 





§  


accounting matters;




 





§  


transactions between affiliates;




 





§  


the installation of environmental emission controls equipment;




 





§  


our ability to decommission generating facilities and recover the remaining carrying value of such facilities;




 





§  


the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources and reductions in energy usage by customers; and




 





§  


the amount of costs associated with these operations that may be recovered from customers.




 

Our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.

 

Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection, including, in particular, climate change and greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions. We are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses. Additionally, to comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees. In addition, we are generally responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. Our facilities are subject to regulations protecting migratory birds, which have recently been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines and/or significant curtailments of our operations, which could materially adversely affect our cash flows and/or results of operations.

 

The scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations, including their effects on our current operations and future expansions, are difficult to predict. Increasing international, national, regional and state-level concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations, operating costs, and the scope and economics of proposed expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. In particular, state-level laws and regulations, as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride), may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations. The implementation of recent and proposed California and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing, among other things, additional costs associated with emission limits, controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits. Similarly, the California Utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates. Even if recoverable, the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth. SDG&E may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met.

 

In addition, existing and future laws and regulation on mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows. 

 

We provide further discussion of these matters in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 

 

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Like other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by natural disasters, catastrophic accidents, or acts of terrorism. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials, as well as radioactive materials, and operating highly energized equipment, the risk to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities is substantially greater than a typical business. Such facilities and infrastructure include, but are not limited to:

 





§ power generation plants

 

 


§ natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and storage

 

 



§ electric transmission and distribution

 

 


§ nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities

 

 



§ LNG terminals and storage

 

 


§ nuclear power facilities

 

 



§ chartered LNG tankers

 

 

  



 

Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues, and/or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires, leaks, radioactive releases, explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties, or cause personal injuries or fatalities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies, we may be liable for damages without being found to be at fault or to have been negligent. Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses. On January 17, 2014, the Governor of California declared a state of emergency because of severe drought conditions in the state. The drought conditions in California and the western United States increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories, which could place our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy. The drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydro-electric generation facilities in the Northwest United States which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the California electric grid managed by the California ISO. If alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydro-electric generation facilities, this could result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E’s service territory.

 

Our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us.

 

Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. We discuss these proceedings in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits, arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, California juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part from our customers, which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or financial condition.

 

We cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. In addition, for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned.

 

To reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, electric generation capacity, and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.

 

In addition, certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting. Such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for that contract. In certain cases, these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged.

 

Risk management procedures may not prevent losses.

 

Although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not always prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.

 

The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.

 

Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a facility-by-facility basis.

 

Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.

 




New business technologies present a risk for attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid.

 

Cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and activities are a priority at Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas. We believe that the most significant cybersecurity risks to our businesses reside within the operations of our utilities. In addition to general information and cyber risks that all Fortune 500 corporations face (e.g. malware, malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces new cybersecurity risks associated with automated metering (virtually all of our SDG&E customers have such metering and SoCalGas is in the process of converting its customers to such metering) and with Smart Grid infrastructure. Deployment of these new business technologies represents a new and large-scale opportunity for attacks on the utilities’ information systems and, more importantly, on the integrity of the energy grid. While our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks, to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity. Addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across Sempra Energy’s businesses, but we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur. An attack to our information systems, the integrity of the energy grid, or one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation.

 

Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.

 

We expect that new technologies will emerge that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Examples of technological change that could impact our businesses include

 





§  


California Utilities—Factors that could change the utilization of natural gas distribution and electric generation, transmission and distribution assets include




 





□  


efficient battery storage technology, combined with




 





□  


the expanded cost effective utilization of distributed generation (i.e., solar rooftop, community solar projects)




 





§  


Sempra U.S. Gas & Power




 





□  


At Sempra Renewables, technological advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage could reduce the demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation. Sempra Renewables’ power sales customers’ ability to perform under long-term agreements could be impacted by utility rate structures and advances in distributed and local power generation.




 





□  


At Sempra Natural Gas, technological advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources could reduce the demand for natural gas.




 





□  


At our LNG businesses, technologies that lower global natural gas and LNG consumption would have the greatest impact on the business. These technologies include cost effective batteries for renewable electricity generation, economic gas to liquids conversion processes and advances associated with seabed or Arctic gas hydrate exploitation.




 

 

Risks Related to the California Utilities

 

The California Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect us.

 

The CPUC regulates the California Utilities’ rates, except SDG&E’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates the California Utilities’:

 





§ conditions of service

 

 


§ rates of depreciation

 

 



§ capital structure

 

 


§ long-term resource procurement

 

 



§ rates of return

 

 


§ sales of securities

 

 




 

The CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances, fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. SoCalGas and SDG&E may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and, for SDG&E, electric operations, under new regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and new citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the California Utilities’ rates, costs, incentive mechanisms, and performance-based regulation in Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.

 

The California Utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval. If the project does not receive regulatory approval, if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes, or if management decides not to proceed with the project, they may be unable to recover all amounts invested in that project, which could materially adversely affect their financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

The CPUC periodically approves the California Utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investment. If actual capital expenditures and/or operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the CPUC, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the California Utilities’ authorized rates of return, changes in which could materially adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

The CPUC applies performance-based measures and incentive mechanisms to all California utilities. Under these, earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals, rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant (rate base) to increase earnings. At the California Utilities, the areas that are currently eligible for incentives are operational activities designated by the CPUC, energy efficiency programs and, at SoCalGas, natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services. Although the California Utilities have received incentive awards in the past, there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future, or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods. Additionally, if the California Utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms, they may be assessed financial disallowances, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

 

The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.

 

The California Utilities may be materially adversely affected by new regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how they operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses.

 

The construction and expansion of the California Utilities’ natural gas pipelines, SoCalGas’ storage facilities, and SDG&E’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits, licenses and other approvals from federal, state and local governmental agencies. If there are delays in obtaining these approvals, or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals, or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, the California Utilities’ businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires competent execution from our employees and contractors, cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay. In the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities.

 

Natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates.

 

Pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations, practices and procedures, the California Utilities may incur substantial incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments. In August 2011, SoCalGas, SDG&E, PG&E and Southwest Gas filed implementation plans with the CPUC to test or replace all natural gas transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested. In their 2011 filing with the CPUC, the California Utilities estimated the total cost for Phase 1 of the two-phase plan to be $3.1 billion ($2.5 billion for SoCalGas and $600 million for SDG&E) over a 10-year period. The California Utilities requested that the incremental capital investment required as a result of any approved plan be included in rate base and that cost recovery be allowed for any other incremental cost not eligible for rate-base recovery. The costs that are the subject of these plans are outside the scope of the 2012 general rate case, or GRC proceedings discussed elsewhere in this report. If the CPUC were to decide that the incremental capital investment not be considered as incremental rate base outside the GRC process or that this incremental capital investment earn a return on rate base lower than what is otherwise authorized, or that cost recovery not be allowed for any other incremental cost, it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects upon commencement of this program. We provide additional information in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 




The California Utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either SDG&E or SoCalGas to be out of compliance.

 

The California State Senate passed legislation in 2013 which requires the CPUC to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring, data tracking and analysis, and investigations, as well as delegates citation authority to CPUC staff personnel under the direction of the CPUC Executive Director. This legislation requires the CPUC to implement the enforcement program for natural gas safety by July 1, 2014 and for electric safety by January 1, 2015. In exercising the citation authority, the CPUC staff will take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations, voluntary resolution efforts undertaken, prior history of violations, the gravity of the violation, and the degree of culpability. The CPUC is planning to adopt an administrative limit on the maximum monetary penalty that may be set by the CPUC staff.

 

In December 2011, the CPUC adopted a natural gas safety citation program whereby natural gas distribution companies can be fined by CPUC staff for violations of the CPUC’s safety standards or federal standards. Each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense. The maximum penalty is $50,000 per offense. In September 2013, the CPUC issued Standard Operating Procedures setting forth its principles and management process for the gas safety citation program.

 

If the CPUC or its staff determine that either of SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with the safety standards, the corrective actions required to be in conformance and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects upon commencement of this program. We provide additional information in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

Meaningful rate reform is necessary due to the increased power supply from renewable energy sources and the growth in distributed and local power generation, and the failure by the CPUC to reform SDG&E’s rate structure in a relevant manner could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

The current electric rate structure in California places an undue burden on customers with heavy electric use while subsidizing low and moderate use customers. In addition, customers who self-generate their own power (primarily solar installations) currently do not pay most transmission and distribution charges, subject to certain limitations. As more heavy use customers purchase solar panels or obtain local off-the-grid sources of power, the burden on the remaining heavy use customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation and increases rate pressures. In addition, the increase of solar and other local off-the-grid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system. Over the mid- to long-term, this rate structure is unsustainable. On January 1, 2014, AB 327 became effective. This new law restores to the CPUC the authority to establish electric rates for electric utility companies in California and removes the rate caps established in AB 1X adopted in early 2001 during California’s energy crisis, as well as Senate Bill 695 adopted in 2009. Additionally, the law provides the CPUC with the authority to adopt up to a $10.00 monthly fixed charge for all residential customers effective January 1, 2015. The CPUC will implement AB 327 through its current Order Instituting Rulemaking proceeding regarding electric rate reform. If the CPUC fails to reform rate structures to maintain competitive and affordable electric rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Recovery of 2007 Wildfire Litigation Costs Requires Future Regulatory Approval.

 

SDG&E is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties. Through December 31, 2013, SDG&E’s costs to settle these claims and its estimated future settlement costs and defense costs are approximately $2.4 billion, which exceeds its $1.1 billion of liability insurance coverage and the approximately $824 million recovered from third parties. SDG&E has concluded that it is probable that SDG&E will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of these excess costs in rates, and at December 31, 2013, Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets of $330 million in Other Regulatory Assets, of which $315 million is related to CPUC-regulated operations and $15 million is related to FERC-regulated operations, with respect to these excess costs. However, recovery of these amounts in rates will require future regulatory approval.

 

In August 2009, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed an application with the CPUC proposing a new mechanism for the future recovery of wildfire-related expenses for claims, litigation expenses and insurance premiums that are in excess of amounts authorized by the CPUC for recovery in distribution rates. In December 2012, the CPUC issued a final decision that denied the proposed blanket cost recovery framework for the utilities but allowed SDG&E to maintain its authorized memorandum account, enabling SDG&E to file applications with the CPUC requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account, subject to reasonableness review, at a later date. For a description of this proceeding and information about 2007 wildfire litigation costs and their recovery, see Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

SDG&E will continue to assess the probability of recovery of these excess wildfire costs in rates. Should SDG&E conclude that recovery in rates is no longer probable, SDG&E will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached. If SDG&E had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to CPUC-regulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated as of December 31, 2013, the resulting after-tax charge against earnings would have been up to $186 million. In addition, in periods following any such conclusion, SDG&E’s earnings will be adversely impacted by increases in the estimated costs to litigate or settle pending wildfire claims.

 

As noted above, recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates will require future regulatory approval, and a failure to obtain all or a significant portion of the expected recovery, or a conclusion that recovery in rates is no longer probable, would likely have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations. In addition, if recovery is permitted, the collection process may extend over a number of years and Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s cash flows may be materially adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recovery in rates. We discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

SDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility.

 

SDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, operated by Southern California Edison Company, or Edison. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. SONGS’ Units 2 and 3 have been shut down since early 2012, and on June 6, 2013, Edison notified SDG&E that it had reached a decision to permanently retire SONGS’ Units 2 and 3 and seek approval from the NRC to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility. Although the facility will be decommissioned in the future, SDG&E’s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility, which include

 





§  


the potential that a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami could cause a catastrophic failure of the safety systems in place that are designed to prevent the release of radioactive material. If such a failure were to occur, a substantial amount of radiation could be released and cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment;




 





§  


the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;




 





§  


limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility;




 





§  


uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility; and




 





§  


the results of the CPUC’s Order Instituting Investigation (OII), as described in more detail below, into the SONGS outage that began in the first quarter of 2012.




 

In addition, SDG&E maintains two trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission SONGS. Up to approximately 33 percent of the trust assets has been generally invested in equity securities, which are subject to market fluctuation. A decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates.

 

The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra Energy’s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Ongoing regulatory and maintenance issues at SONGS may have a material adverse effect on us.

 

SONGS’ Units 2 and 3 have been shut down since early 2012, after a water leak occurred in the Unit 3 steam generator. Since the unscheduled outage started, SDG&E has procured power to ensure a reliable supply of power to meet customers’ needs, replacing the power that would have been available had SONGS been in operation. The estimated cost of the purchased replacement power incurred from January 2012 through June 6, 2013, the date Edison notified SDG&E of its decision to permanently close SONGS, was approximately $165 million. Of this total, $98 million was incurred in 2012 and has been approved for collection in rates pursuant to prior Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) proceedings. The remaining $67 million represents replacement power costs incurred through June 6, 2013 that have not yet been approved for recovery in rates. In addition to the estimated cost of the purchased replacement power, SDG&E’s share of SONGS’ operating costs, including depreciation, and the return on its investment in SONGS from January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, was approximately $300 million.

 

In November 2012, the CPUC issued an OII into the SONGS outage to determine whether SDG&E should remove from customer rates some or all of the revenue requirement associated with the portion of the facility that was out of service. This OII will consolidate most SONGS issues from related regulatory proceedings and consider the appropriate cost recovery for SONGS during the shutdown, including among other costs, the cost of the steam generator replacement project, replacement power costs, capital expenditures, operation and maintenance costs and seismic study costs, and the appropriate rate design regarding the recovery of the remaining investment in and any return on the remaining investment in SONGS from the time the Units were taken off-line. The OII requires that all costs related to SONGS incurred since January 1, 2012 be tracked in memorandum accounts, and that all revenues collected since January 1, 2012, for recovery of such costs and for the return on SDG&E’s investment in SONGS be subject to refund. The OII will address the extent to which such revenues, if any, will be required to be refunded to customers.

 

As a result of Edison’s decision to permanently retire SONGS’ Units 2 and 3 and seek approval to start the decommissioning activities of the entire facility, SDG&E has removed the net book value of its investment in SONGS and established a new regulatory asset, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for regulated entities, representing the amount management believes is probable of recovery in future rates. As a result of this analysis, Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include an after-tax loss of $119 million reflected in the regulatory asset to reduce the amount that management believes is probable of recovery in rates in the future to $303 million, which is included in Other Regulatory Assets on Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013. Any failure to recover some or all of this regulatory asset, the cost of purchased replacement power of $98 million approved in prior ERRA proceedings for collection in rates, or operating or other costs associated with SONGS (including approximately $184 million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred by SDG&E since the start of the forced outages), or any decision by the CPUC to require refund of revenues collected in recovery of the costs above could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra Energy’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

 

Should SDG&E conclude that recovery in rates is different than the amount anticipated or is no longer probable, SDG&E will record an additional charge against earnings at the time such a conclusion is reached, which could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra Energy’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

 

We discuss SONGS matters in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

 

Risks Related to our Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power Businesses

 

Our businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks.

 

Sempra Mexico, Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas generate electricity that they sell under long-term contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets. Sempra Mexico and Sempra Natural Gas purchase natural gas to fuel their power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy their contractual obligations. As part of their risk management strategy, they may hedge a substantial portion of their electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage their portfolios, which subjects us to the risk that the counterparty to such hedge may be unable to fulfill its obligations. Such a failure could materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations.

 

We buy energy-related commodities from time to time, for power plants or for LNG terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity, natural gas, LNG or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.

 

Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities result from multiple factors, including:

 





§  


weather conditions




 





§  


seasonality




 





§  


changes in supply and demand




 





§  


transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies




 





§  


availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources




 





§  


commodity production levels




 





§  


actions by oil producing nations or organizations affecting the global supply of crude oil




 





§  


federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation




 





§  


natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events




 





§  


expropriation of assets by foreign countries




 

The FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates, independent system operators, and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate. The FERC may impose additional price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms, or terminate existing price limitations from time to time. Any such action by the FERC may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

When our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices, and interest rate risks.

 

Sempra Mexico, Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings, and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. We may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs. The failure to so fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.

 

Business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

The acquisition, development, construction and expansion of LNG terminals, natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities, electric generation and transmission facilities, and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built.

 

Success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things:

 





§  


negotiation of satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction agreements




 





§  


negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements




 





§  


timely receipt of required governmental permits, licenses, authorizations, and rights of way




 





§  


timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction




 





§  


obtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project




 

Successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by:

 





§  


unforeseen engineering problems




 





§  


construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls




 





§  


work stoppages




 





§  


equipment unavailability or delay and cost increases




 





§  


adverse weather conditions




 





§  


environmental and geological conditions




 





§  


litigation




 





§  


unsettled property rights




 





§  


other factors




 

If we are unable to complete the development of a facility or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

The operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of electric generation or natural gas regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, regasification, liquefaction, storage and transmission systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

With respect to our proposed project to add LNG export capability at our Cameron facility, we currently anticipate building a facility consisting of three liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 13.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG with an expected export capability of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf per day. The anticipated incremental investment in the three-train liquefaction project, subject to final design specifications, is estimated to be approximately $6 billion to $7 billion, excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs. While we have signed commercial development agreements with Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and a subsidiary of GDF SUEZ S.A., these agreements only bind the parties to fund certain development costs, including design, permitting and engineering costs of the proposed project and to negotiate in good faith 20-year tolling agreements with respect to 12 Mtpa of LNG, which tolling agreements were executed in May 2013. However, the development agreements do not obligate the parties to finance the actual construction of this new facility. The joint venture agreement and the three tolling agreements are subject to a final investment decision to proceed by each party, finalization of permit authorizations and securing financing commitments, as well as other customary conditions. If one or more of the parties decides not to move forward with the project, or if we are unable to arrange suitable financing, the project may be substantially delayed, reduced or terminated. If the project is terminated, we may not recover our share of any project development or other related costs expended, and we may be required to write off our share of any such previously capitalized costs. In addition, this project may be delayed, reduced or terminated in the event we are unable to obtain all of the necessary permits, licenses and authorizations in a timely manner. The anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and is subject to final design specifications, and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of $6 billion to $7 billion of incremental investment, excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs. Customers look at a number of factors when evaluating participation in a project, and changes in these factors, including global natural gas and LNG prices, could have an impact on the project going forward. Prior to our final investment decision and in the event we decide not to proceed with the project, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our prospects. Following our final investment decision and in the event we decide to proceed with the project, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and/or prospects.

 

We may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into or replace expiring long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition.

 

The electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Natural Gas’ and Sempra Mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Sempra Mexico and Sempra Natural Gas utilize their LNG terminals by entering into long-term capacity agreements. Under these agreements, customers pay us capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customer’s LNG. These segments also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at their terminals for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. If the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the LNG facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. Also, although our Cameron LNG terminal is not fully contracted for regasification, given our current progress on the liquefaction project discussed above, we do not expect to contract or sell any additional LNG import capacity at the Cameron terminal. Our potential LNG suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks, which may also affect the supply of LNG.

 

Sempra Mexico’s and Sempra Natural Gas’ natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Sempra Natural Gas owns a 25-percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), a partnership that operates a natural gas pipeline, the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX). Sempra Natural Gas and the partnership have agreements for capacity on REX that expire at various dates through 2019. As these agreements expire, new contracting activity related to that capacity may not be sufficient to replace the revenues from the expiring agreements.

 

We provide information about these matters in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

Our businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to so perform, we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Our businesses are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements. Should they fail to so perform, we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, many of our agreements are essential to the conduct and growth of our businesses. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects. Finally, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.

 

Sempra Mexico’s and Sempra Natural Gas’ obligations and those of their suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to (1) suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties; and (2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements, which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.

 




Legal actions challenging our property rights could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

We are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties on and adjacent to our LNG terminal in Mexico, as we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. In the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our LNG terminal is located, we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal. If we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

We rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver electricity and natural gas.

 

We depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:

 





§  


deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets,




 





§  


supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities, and




 





§  


provide retail energy services to customers.




 

Sempra Mexico and Sempra Natural Gas also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra Mexico and Sempra Natural Gas also rely on specialized ships to transport LNG to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. Sempra Natural Gas, Sempra Renewables, Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies and LNG at then-current spot market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

Our international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

We own or have interests in Mexico in electricity generation, distribution and transmission facilities, natural gas, propane and ethane distribution, storage and transportation projects, and an LNG terminal, and electricity transmission and distribution businesses in Chile and Peru. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets, and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political, legal, regulatory and financial risks that vary by country, including:

 





§  


changes in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations, in each case, that are related to foreign operations




 





§  


governance by and decisions of local regulatory bodies, including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses




 





§  


high rates of inflation




 





§  


volatility in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and currencies of the countries in which we operate




 





§  


changes in government policies or personnel




 





§  


trade restrictions




 





§  


limitations on U.S. company ownership in foreign countries




 





§  


permitting and regulatory compliance




 





§  


changes in labor supply and labor relations




 





§  


adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits and approvals, difficulty in enforcing contractual and property rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions




 





§  


expropriation of assets




 





§  


adverse changes in the stability of the governments in the countries in which we operate




 





§  


general political, social, economic and business conditions




 

Our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks. These risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies. In such cases, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries. We may or may not choose to hedge these risks, and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

 

We discuss litigation related to Sempra Mexico’s Energía Costa Azul LNG terminal and other international energy projects in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

 

Other Risks

 

Sempra Energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.

 

As described above, SDG&E holds a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, which is operated by Edison. Also, Sempra Natural Gas owns a 25-percent interest in Rockies Express, a joint venture that operates a natural gas pipeline. Our investment in Rockies Express is $329 million at December 31, 2013. Rockies Express is controlled by Tallgrass Energy Partners, which holds a 50-percent interest. At December 31, 2013, Sempra Renewables has investments totaling $707 million in several joint ventures to develop and operate renewable generation facilities. Sempra Mexico owns a 50-percent interest in a joint venture with PEMEX that operates several natural gas pipelines and propane systems in northern Mexico. At December 31, 2013, this investment is $379 million. Sempra Energy has an investment balance of $73 million at December 31, 2013 that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the RBS Sempra Commodities LLP (RBS Sempra Commodities) partnership as it is dissolved. The timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to RBS Sempra Commodities in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. The failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the partnership could have a corresponding effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to make investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control. We discuss these investments further in Notes 3, 4 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 

Sempra Natural Gas is currently progressing with plans to develop its Cameron LNG regasification facility for liquefaction capability in a joint venture structure with three partners where we will have 50.2 percent of the joint venture. We discuss these plans further in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report.

 

We have limited influence over these and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

 

Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require Sempra Energy, SDG&E and/or SoCalGas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

 

Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. A decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans. In addition, the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including the assumed rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation. An adverse change to any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.
