Reclassifications  

        Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004 have been reclassified to
conform to the presentation used in 2006. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Test
Solutions Business", to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the reclassification of financial information for discontinued operations. See Note 7, "Equity in
Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale — Lumileds" to our consolidated financial statements for reclassification of equity in net income. 


Overview and Executive Summary  

        Agilent, incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world's premier measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic
measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16 percent of our stock in
November 1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the
form of a stock dividend. 

        Our
fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 


        Agilent
currently has two businesses focused on bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement. During the past year, we divested two of our historical businesses, the
semiconductor products business and the semiconductor test solutions business. In December 2005, we sold the semiconductor products business and recorded a gain of approximately
$1.8 billion. In October 2006, we completed the distribution to our stockholders of our semiconductor test solutions business. We have reflected both the semiconductor products business
and the semiconductor test solutions business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        Agilent's
net revenue from continuing operations in 2006 was $4,973 million, an increase of 6 percent in comparison to 2005. In our bio-analytical business, net
revenue in 2006 increased 9 percent in comparison to 2005. Demand increased across all markets in bio-analytical measurement with strongest growth occurring in biotechnology
solutions. In our electronic measurement business, net revenue in 2006 increased 5 percent in comparison to 2005. The electronic measurement business saw growth in our general purpose segments,
led by aerospace /defense and semiconductor design and manufacturing. Agilent's total net revenue in 2005 increased 3 percent in comparison to 2004. 

        Net
income in 2006 was $3,307 million, which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for $1,816 million and the sale of our
investment in Lumileds for a gain of $901 million. Net income in 2005 was $327 million, a decrease of 11 percent in comparison to $369 million in 2004. The decrease in
total net income for 2005 was driven by a $174 million decrease in net income associated with discontinued operations offset by a $132 million increase in net income from continuing
operations. 

        In
2006, we generated operating cash flows of $431 million and had a cash and cash equivalent balance as of October 31, 2006 of $2,262 million. In 2005, we generated
operating cash flows of $656 million and had a cash and cash equivalent balance as of October 31, 2005 of $2,226 million. 

        The
following significant events were accomplished in fiscal year 2006: 



•In
November 2005, we finalized the sale of our investment in Lumileds to Philips for $949 million plus the repayment of $51 million of the outstanding
principal debt and interest due to us.
•In
December 2005, we sold our semiconductor products business to Avago. We received approximately $2.6 billion in cash proceeds.
•In
October 2006, we completed the spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. The aggregate market value of ordinary shares distributed to
Agilent stockholders was approximately $840 million.
•In
June 2006, we completed a stock repurchase program of $4.466 billion of our common stock and in September 2006 we commenced another stock repurchase
program for up to $2.0 billion dollars, to be completed over the next 2 years.
•We
completed the actions necessary to reduce our infrastructure costs by approximately $450 million. 


        Having
completed the disposal of two semiconductor-related businesses, Agilent is less exposed to the highly cyclical semiconductor market. Therefore, we expect that Agilent's current
operating model will experience lower cyclicality in revenue and costs than we experienced in prior years. Looking forward, we are mindful of the economic uncertainties in the year ahead and Agilent's
focus is to leverage, through higher sustainable growth, the more stable operating model we've built. Our goal is to grow our revenue at a faster rate than the electronic measurement and
bio-analytical measurement markets, primarily through increasing market share and complementary acquisitions which will add to our top line growth. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
believed to be reasonable. Although 

34




 


these
estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical
accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition,
restructuring and asset impairment charges, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of
long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes. 


                Revenue recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software),
services, and other arrangements
(multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have
transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the
acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and
recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from
services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair
value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our
judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an
arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. Most of these conditions are subjective and actual
results could vary from the estimated outcome, requiring future adjustments to revenue. 

                Restructuring and asset impairment charges.    The three main components of our
restructuring plans are related to workforce
reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after
individuals have been notified of their termination dates
and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease
income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. These estimates were derived using the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), Staff Accounting Bulletin 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges"
("SAB 100"), Emerging Issues Task Force 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94-3") and
lastly, SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146"). If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from
what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded. 

                Inventory valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and
periodically write down the value for
estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by
this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory 

35




 


charge.
Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize
recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable
than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. 


                Investment impairments.    We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair
value of our publicly traded equity
securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or
circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is
other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee,
and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 


                Share-based compensation.    We account for share-based awards in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123(R), Shared-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123(R)") which was effective November 1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the new standard, share-based compensation expense is primarily based
on estimated grant date fair value which is generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards granted after November 1,
2005 over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November 1, 2005, we recognize share-based compensation expense based on FASB Interpretation
28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an interpretation of APB Opinions No. 15 and 25", which provides for accelerated expensing. Our
estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options),
future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the
historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior. We estimate the stock price volatility using the implied volatility of Agilent's publicly
traded stock options. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. 

                Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement
benefit plan
costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is
intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To
estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health
care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition.
We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. 

36




 


        The
discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date — October 31 for U.S. plans and September 30
for non-U.S plans. For U.S. plans, the discount rate was determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against the cash flows from a hypothetically constructed portfolio of
high quality corporate bonds. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as a proxy for setting the discount rate. The discount rate increased slightly over the prior year to
6.0 percent. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount
rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds. In recent years, decreasing interest rates, particularly outside the U.S., have increased
our benefit obligations and our net plan costs. These increases have been in large part offset by a declining number of plan participants as a result of our various restructuring programs. The entire
impact of declining discount rates is not recognized immediately under current accounting standards. As of October 31, 2006, delayed recognition of the impact of declining discount rates was
the primary factor in approximately $297 million in unrecognized
actuarial losses for non-U.S. plans. These losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants — ranging from 12 to
18 years depending on the plan. 

        The
expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns. As of October 31,
2006, delayed recognition of better than expected investment performance was a significant factor in $63 million of unrecognized actuarial gains for U.S. plans. These gains will be recognized
over approximately 12 years or the expected average future service life for U.S. plan participants. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2006
would result in a $6 million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $15 million impact on non-U.S. pension expense. 

        The
net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were $81 million in 2006, $106 million in 2005 and $122 million in 2004.
Due to final payouts from our Excess Plan in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2007, we expect a settlement under SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We cannot currently estimate this impact. 


                Valuation of long-lived assets.    We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in
the fourth quarter of
2006. Based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We have also assessed the recoverability
of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of
property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and
equipment net of costs to sell. During 2006, we incurred $42 million of asset impairment charges, which includes approximately $3 million recorded in discontinued operations. In
addition, we recorded $1 million of investment impairment charges during 2006. 

        The
process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. We estimate expected future cash flows of our
various businesses, which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We then determine the carrying value of these businesses. We exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain
assets and liabilities to these businesses. We then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of future cash flows is less
than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with
the assets are critical to 

37




 


these
assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 

        The
process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets such as our property, plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment.
In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market
factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge
to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often
subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business
strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could
materially impact our reported financial results. 

                Accounting for income taxes.    Significant management judgment is required in determining
our provision for income taxes and
in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or
foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. Realization is based on our ability
to generate sufficient future taxable income. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation
allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than
not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and selected entities
in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence, which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was recorded in
all instances. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Profits or losses incurred in the U.S. and
selected entities in foreign jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance. We expect that the effective tax rate applied to our pre-tax income in fiscal 2007 will be
lower than it otherwise would be because future income taxes in the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions will
be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions. Income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions
subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions. 

        We
have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. 

        The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our
estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to
be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. 

38




 


Restructuring and Asset Impairment  

        We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). The workforce reduction portion of the
Prior Plans was completed during fiscal year 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, due to the then pending divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses, we
launched a new restructuring plan ("2005 Plan") to reduce our workforce and facility footprint to match a smaller organizational size. 

        In
2006 we continued execution of the 2005 plan and recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $186 million, of which $111 million was for workforce reduction
expenses and the remainder for facility impairment and lease termination expenses. As of October 31, 2006, our accrual for pending workforce reduction costs was $13 million, which is
down from the $44 million balance from the prior year as the workforce reduction program winds down. Our accrual for the consolidation of excess facilities, however, increased $9 million
from the prior year due to significant facility consolidation efforts that were initiated during the past year. The workforce reduction portion of the 2005 plan is expected to be substantially
completed in fiscal year 2007, but we will continue to make lease payments on some of our excess facility space for approximately the next five years. 

        The
restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For further details on our restructuring
plans, see Note 19, "Restructuring and Asset Impairment", to our consolidated financial statements. 

Foreign Currency  

        Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global
operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated
basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency
movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling
twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. For example, over the last three years the U.S dollar has weakened against the Euro and the British pound
and although we successfully hedged currency movements in those currencies each year, we have experienced a net increase in reported expenses in Europe as a result of currency fluctuations over this
time period. 

Results from Continuing Operations  

        The following discussion excludes our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business as their results are reported as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

        Income
from continuing operations in 2006 was $1,437 million, which included the gain on sale of our Lumileds investment of $901 million. In 2005, we recorded
$191 million in income from continuing operations compared to $59 million recorded in 2004.

        Net
revenue in 2006 was $4,973 million, a 6 percent increase over the $4,685 million net revenue recorded in 2005. Net revenue in 2005 was $4,685 million, a
3 percent increase over the $4,556 million net revenue recorded in 2004. 

        Bio-analytical
measurement results were consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and reflected increased demand across virtually all of our markets. Our
bio-analytical business is comprised of two areas, life science and chemical analysis. In life science, growth was due to demand from biotechnology customers and the impact of new product
introduction in LC, LCMS and microarrays. In chemical analysis growth was driven by demand for environmental and food testing solutions.. Our electronic measurement business saw a 5 percent
revenue growth, solid profitability, and good return on invested capital. Growth was driven by underlying customer demand in several key markets, including semiconductor design and verification, and
consumer electronics design and manufacturing. However, growth was negatively impacted because of two factors: First, capital spending in the wireline segment was constrained by mergers in the
customer base (both NEMs and communication service providers) as well as uncertainty in service providers' investments as they transition from fixed-line to IP-based
networks and services. Second, we had a slowdown in our wireless monitoring business, as the industry transitions from 2G to 3G networks amid stronger competition. 


        Services
and other revenue includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. In 2006 and 2005, services and other revenue
increased over the prior years as our installed base of products increased and a change in standard warranty from three years to one year drove a higher volume of extended warranty business.

charges primarily relate to inventory write-downs for exited product lines, which management has not reflected in segment results. 

        In
2006, total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2005. This improvement was the result of volume increases and cost efficiencies, in particular,
restructuring activities, material cost reductions and overall operational improvements. In addition, we benefited from the refunctionalization of some general corporate expenses out of costs of
products and services and into operating expense, which is consistent with our current less manufacturing-intensive operations following the disposal of our semiconductor products and semiconductor
test solutions businesses. In 2005, total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2004. The increase was attributable to our efforts to lower our cost structure and refine
our operating model. In 2005, we benefited from a more variable cost structure through use of contract manufacturers and we reduced manufacturing costs by shifting production to lower-cost
regions. These benefits continued through 2006. 

41






<A
NAME="page_do1318_1_42">  




        Operating margins in 2006 increased 4 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to continued restructuring activities and tighter controls on spending. In 2005 operating margin
increased 4 percentage points compared to 2004. This was primarily due to savings from our restructuring efforts and a decrease in restructuring costs for research and development and selling,
general and administrative expenses in 2005 compared to 2004. 

        Our
research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our
operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which
enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation
pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical
competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge
management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation
technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the
short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed
to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, other research is on major new product releases, and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future. Because of
the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses, it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects either in
the periods presented or on a forward looking basis. 

        Income
from continuing operations in 2006 was $1,437 million, which includes a gain of $901 million for the sale of our investment in Lumileds, an equity investment. The
remaining increase in income from continuing operations, in comparison to the prior year, is attributable to an increase in revenue of $288 million, an increase in net interest income of
$64 million and also attributable to the gain recorded in connection with the sale of two properties located in California for a net gain of approximately $121 million. Income from
continuing operations in 2005 was $191 million, an increase of approximately $132 million in comparison to 2004. The increase was primarily driven by reduction in costs and expenses due
to the incremental benefits of our restructuring programs and discretionary spending controls. 

        At
October 31, 2006, our headcount, on a continuing operations basis, was approximately 18,700 compared to 19,400 in 2005 and 19,800 in 2004. The decrease in workforce is
predominantly due to infrastructure reduction in light of the recent business divestitures.

        For
the year ended October 31, 2006, we recorded an income tax provision of $91 million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of
$142 million and $57 million on 

42




 


continuing
operations for the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the U.S. Income
generated in the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions were offset by adjustments to their respective valuation allowances. The income tax provision also
includes a benefit of $29 million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax
Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. 

        For
2006, the annual effective tax rate was 6.0 percent on continuing operations. The 6.0 percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes on the sale of our Lumileds
joint venture at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to the operation of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. In addition, the low continuing
operations tax rate is a result of the $29 million benefit related to the resolution of issues covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The tax rate for
continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which
are now reported as discontinued operations. 

        For
2005, the annual effective tax rate was 42.6 percent on continuing operations. This tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from
low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, the
repatriation tax of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") caused a 7.2 percent increase in the 2005 effective tax rate as during 2005 we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had
not previously provided U.S. taxes. 

        For
2004, the annual effective tax rate was 49.1 percent on continuing operations. This tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from
low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations. In addition,
non-deductible goodwill increased the rate by 5.6 percent. 

        On
October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an
85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and
reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970 million and a related tax liability of approximately $48 million in our fiscal 2005 federal income tax return. For
2005, $23 million of the $48 million is provided for in the discontinued operations' provision for income taxes, while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations'
provision for income taxes. 

        Agilent
enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain
classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by
$76 million, $54 million and $96 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is anticipated that these tax holidays will benefit Agilent in a similar way in 2007. 

        During
2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets
are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the 

43




 


U.S
and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under SFAS No. 109 to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full
valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal. 

        In
connection with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit of our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in
October 2006 in which the IRS claims significant increases to our U.S. taxable income which could result in a commensurate increase in our U.S. income taxes payable. This claim relates to the
use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates. We expect to receive a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) with respect to this claim in due course in which we anticipate the IRS will assert a
significant aggregate tax deficiency, plus interest and possible penalties. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that the chances of the IRS
prevailing on the claim are remote. Accordingly, we will oppose the claimed adjustments vigorously. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", we have not accrued an income
tax liability in our October 31, 2006 financial statements as we believe the possibility that the IRS will be successful in its claim for the adjustment is remote. 


        For
all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes
and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of
these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary. 


Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale — Lumileds  

        Lumileds was a global joint venture between Agilent and KoninklijkePhilips Electronics N.V.("Philips"). Lumileds manufactures high-power light
emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Agilent sold its interest in Lumileds on November 28, 2005. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction,
the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949 million. In addition, Lumileds repaid
the $51 million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2001. 


        Our
equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901 million in 2006, $42 million in 2005 and
$29 million in 2004. 

General Infrastructure and Shared Services  

        For Agilent overall, in response to the divestiture and spin-off of our semiconductor businesses, we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily
through restructuring programs and streamlining our operations. We have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance, IT and workplace services and
moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions. In 2006, savings for infrastructure costs associated with restructuring plans, IT data center and networking costs, IT
project investments and cost controls were approximately $280 million compared with 2005. We passed these savings on to all our businesses according to usage of related services. The general
infrastructure and shared services functions ended 2006 with approximately 2,750 employees, a decrease of approximately 1,160 employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately 1,300
employees from two years ago. Over the past two years, general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped by approximately 1,190 people in the U.S. and Europe and has also dropped by
approximately 110 people in Asia. Although reductions in infrastructure costs are largely complete as we have divested our 

44




 


semiconductor
products business and spun-off our semiconductor test solutions business, we expect that a few key infrastructure areas such as IT and workplace services will continue to see
savings in the next fiscal year. 

Segment Overview  

        During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business See Note 3,
"Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" to our consolidated financial statements for further
information. With this reorganization, Agilent has two businesses — bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement. In addition to the discussion below, also see
Note 23, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements.

        The
order and revenue information below reflects a characterization using a new methodology for defining "communications test" and "general purpose test" as the markets into which our
products are sold. This is a change from our previous classification method which relied on product type as the primary classification mechanism. 

        Compared
to 2005, electronic measurement experienced a 5 percent increase in orders. Order growth was driven by strength in electronic manufacturing test, wireless component test,
and signal sources for both aerospace/defense and wireless communication applications. The 3 percent increase in orders in 2005 compared to 2004 was related to significant growth in our
wireline communications test businesses while wireless communications test orders grew only slightly in that period. 

        Electronic
measurement revenues were up 5 percent year-over-year in 2006 mainly attributable to increased volumes. Communications test made up
approximately 43 percent of the electronic measurement revenues for the year, and wireless test made up approximately 82 percent of communications test. Communication test revenues were
down 3 percent year-over-year, with a 14 percent year-over-year decline in wireline test and wireless test flat to last year. The decline
in wireline test was driven by weakness in the router test and network monitoring businesses, while growth in wireless design software and wireless R&D were offset by weakness in the wireless network
monitoring market. General purpose test revenues grew 11 percent over 2005, with strength in semiconductor design and verification, aerospace/defense and consumer electronic manufacturing 

45




 


applications.
In 2005 segment revenues increased 1 percent compared to 2004 due to the strength of our signal analyzers and signal generator-related products, telecom service provider network
integration and next-generation IP services. 

        Looking
forward to 2007, we anticipate revenue growth to be driven by opportunities tied to the continued development and deployment of multi-media (voice, data, audio, video) wireless
services, proliferation of broadband and triple-play wireline offerings, expansion of the breadth of our product offerings, and growth in nanotechnology applications.

        Over
the past three years, we have implemented cost reduction and restructuring plans to help lower our cost structure. Our electronic measurement business ended 2006 with approximately
11,850 employees, an increase of approximately 400 employees from one year ago. The increase in workforce has occurred primarily in lower cost geographies. 

        Gross
margin for products and services increased 3 percentage points year-over-year in 2006. Gross margin for products and services increased
2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement for all periods were driven by some volume increases and also by restructuring activities, material cost reductions, lower
inventory charges and overall operational improvements. 

        Operating
margin increased 3 percentage points in 2006 compared to 2005, with improved gross margins driving almost all of the change. Operating margin increased
2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004, and was driven by savings in selling, general and administrative expenses offset by increases in research and development expenditure. 



 Income from Operations  



        Income from operations increased in 2006 by $119 million compared to 2005 on a revenue increase of $154 million. Restructuring through selective
workforce reductions, reductions in our cost structure, improved material costs, lower inventory charges and overall operational improvements helped comparative operating results, with most of the
improvement coming from better gross margins. In absolute dollars cost of sales was down 2 percent from 2005 while revenue increased by 5 percent over the same period. 

        Income
from operations increased in 2005 by $81 million compared to 2004 on a revenue increase of $40 million. Restructuring through workforce reductions, reduction in our
cost structure and discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results.

Bio-analytical Measurement  

        Our bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that
enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include: microarrays, microfluidics, gas
chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services. The business continued to achieve solid growth in 2006, with both
orders and revenue growing by 9 percent, compared to 2005, and operating income up 22 percent. All seven key product categories contributed to the overall growth of the
bio-analytical measurement segment. In 2005 sustained growth was recorded compared to 2004 with orders and net revenue increasing by 12 percent and 7 percent respectively and
operating income up 6 percent.

        Bio-analytical
measurement business orders continued to grow, achieving record levels in 2006. In both 2005 and 2006, growth was achieved in all geographies, with the highest
rates achieved in Asia and Europe. Results were consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and reflected strong demand across virtually all of our markets. 

        Chemical
analysis orders, representing approximately 57 percent of bio- analytical measurement, grew 8 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, we
continued to see strength from the food and environmental segments due to increased testing demands from new regulations enacted in Europe and Asia, particularly China and India. These regulatory
changes led to strong demand for our gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry solutions that are used for food and environmental testing. Also new products such as the triple
quadrupole ("QQQ") mass spectrometer which sell into these segments were well received. In addition, higher average oil prices for the year continue to drive demand for our instrumentation in the
hydrocarbon processing and petrochemical industries. Chemical analysis orders grew 11 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 driven by demand for environmental testing solutions in Asia and strength
in US Government spending relating to homeland security. 

        Life
science orders, representing approximately 43 percent of bio- analytical measurement, grew 11 percent for the 2006 year compared to 2005. This
double digit growth was aided by the broad and rapid acceptance of recently introduced products such as the 1200 rapid resolution liquid chromatograph, QQQ mass spectrometer, new liquid chromatography
columns, and new microarrays. During the year, we saw strong demand from contract research organizations and generic drug manufacturers in Europe and Asia, which helped offset a mostly soft spending
year for large pharmaceuticals in the Americas region. Life science orders grew 14 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 driven primarily by biotechnology and increased demand from generic drug
manufacture. 

47




 


        Revenues
for the year grew 9 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Both chemical analysis and life sciences had solid annual growth finishing the year at 9 percent and
10 percent respectively. Chemical analysis continues to see strong demand for our food and environmental testing solutions, which use instruments in the areas of liquid and gas chromatography
and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. In life sciences, demand from contract research organizations and generic drug manufacturers for product such as microarrays, liquid and gas chromatography
mass spectrometry products contributed to this segment's growth. In 2005, chemical analysis grew 5 percent compared to 2004, with most of this growth driven by increasing environmental testing
in Asia, while in life science; this segment grew 9 percent, as growth in this segment was driven by increased demand from generic drug manufacturers. 

        Looking
forward to 2007, we anticipate order and revenue to grow from 2006 levels, with strength across both our chemical analysis and life science businesses. We anticipate growth to be
driven by recently released products such as rapid resolution liquid chromatography, enhanced single quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, QQQ, mass spectrometer, and quadrupole
time-of-flight ("QTOF") mass spectrometry systems.

        Gross
margin in 2006 from products and services increased 2 percentage points compared to the same period last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased
revenue, manufacturing overhead efficiencies, and a decrease in general infrastructure costs. Gross margins
increased by 2 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due to revenue growth, improved microarray production processes, and increased efficiencies in support delivery. 

        Research
and development expenses in 2006 increased by 5 percent compared to the same period last year. This increase is due to continued investment in life sciences, increase in
headcount from acquisitions, program spending to support our new product releases for this year, and higher general infrastructure costs. Research and development costs increased by 16 percent
in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to investment to support new product introductions, acquisition activity and Life Science businesses. 

        Selling,
general, and administrative expenses in 2006 increased 14 percent compared to the same period last year. This is due to higher employee-related costs, incremental
headcount from acquisitions, product launch expense to support new product releases, and higher general infrastructure costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
10 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased infrastructure costs and integration expenses to support acquisitions. 

48




 


        Operating
margins increased by 1 percentage point in 2006 compared to 2005. This is due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies offsetting the higher investments we made
in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to accommodate growth. In 2005, operating margins were flat compared to 2004, as we heavily invested in research and development
and small headcount increases in selling, general, and administrative to support growth. 



 Income from Operations  



        Income from operations increased 22 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased revenue and operational efficiencies that offset higher investments
and higher general infrastructure costs that were made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to support our growth. Operating income increased 6 percent in 2005
compared to 2004 due to increased revenue. 

Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business  

        On December 1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago Technologies Ltd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2.6 billion in cash proceeds. For further information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor
Products Business", to our consolidated financial statements. 

        Discontinued
operations results for our semiconductor products business for the past three years, including the gain from sale in the year ended October 31, 2006, are summarized
in the table below. In the year ended October 31, 2005, the results include the camera module business, which was sold in February 2005.

Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business  

        On August 15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded
company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7 million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds
of $121 million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to Verigy of $19 million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the
agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140 million. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74 million related to the
excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Following the offering, Agilent owned 50 million shares or approximately 85 percent of Verigy's ordinary shares. 

49




 


        On
October 31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85 percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The
spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310 million. In the distribution, Agilent
distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October 16, 2006. In the aggregate,
Agilent distributed 50 million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 31,
2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was $840 million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. For further information, see Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business", to
our consolidated financial statements.

Indemnifications  

        In connection with the divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses in 2006, we have provided indemnities to Verigy and Avago
against certain damages which they might incur related to the businesses of Agilent not transferred to them and other defined categories of liability. These new indemnity obligations are in addition
to preexisting indemnities to Hewlett Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP; indemnities to our officers and directors for certain liabilities which they
might incur as a result of their service to Agilent; and other indemnifications which are customary in our industry or provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in connection with
our commercial operations. These indemnities are described in greater detail in Note 17, "Guarantees", to our consolidated financial statements. 

Financial Condition  



 Liquidity and Capital Resources  



        Our financial position remained strong at October 31, 2006, with cash and cash equivalents of $2,262 million as compared to $2,226 million at
October 31, 2005. 



 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  



        We generated cash from continuing operations of $431 million in 2006 compared to $656 million in 2005. 

50




 

        We
paid approximately $156 million in taxes during 2006 as compared to $75 million in 2005. The higher tax payments in 2006 were mostly associated with the U.S. tax
liability created in 2005 for repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of $970 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and with the 2005 federal alternate minimum
tax. 

        We
also made higher disbursements for restructuring activities of $166 million during 2006, primarily in the form of severance payments, compared to $110 million during
2005. The restructuring payments were more than offset by proceeds from the real estate sales related to the consolidation of excess facilities as reported in the investing section below. We have also
paid approximately $155 million during 2006 under our variable pay programs, as compared to approximately $83 million paid out during 2005. 

        In
2006, accounts receivable generated cash of $8 million versus cash generated of $47 million in 2005. Days sales outstanding was reduced to 47 days in 2006 as
compared to 49 days in 2005. Though revenue increased by 6 percent year-over-year, decline in day's sales outstanding reflects continuing improvement in
receivables management. In 2006, accounts payable generated cash of $56 million versus cash generated of $19 million in 2005. Inventory used cash of $55 million in 2006 compared
to $12 million generated in 2005. Inventory days on hand were 95 days in 2006 compared to 90 days in 2005. 


        We
contributed $41 million to fund our U.S. defined benefit plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we contributed $76 million to fund our international defined
benefits plans, compared to $34 million in 2005. In 2006, total pension plan contributions were $117 million, or 56 percent more than in 2005. In 2007, we expect funding
requirements for our various benefit plans to decrease to a total of approximately $39 million. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus
our projected liabilities, among other factors. As the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status. In
2006, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability for $112 million as several of our non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess
of the fair value of plan assets. The establishment of the additional minimum liability also resulted in a net long term deferred tax asset for $34 million. 

        Net
cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations related to semiconductor products business was $7 million during 2006 as compared to $256 million in
2005. We completed the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005. 

        Net
cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations related to semiconductor test solutions business was $196 million during 2006 as compared to
$13 million used in 2005. We completed the spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business in October 2006. 



 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities  



        Net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations 2006 was $1,838 million compared to $159 million used in the same period in 2005. 

        In
December 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products division for $2.5 billion net of transaction costs and taxes. In November 2005, we also
completed the sale of our ownership in Lumileds to Philips for approximately $949 million, plus repayment of approximately $51 million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest
from Lumileds. Sale of ownership in Lumileds resulted in a gain of approximately $901 million. 

51




 


        Restricted
cash, cash equivalents and investments, net, increased by $1,584 million in 2006 as compared to a $22 million increase in 2005. In connection with the financing
described under "Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities" below, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. ("World
Trade"), which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent, is required to hold short-term investments. These short-term investments have been disclosed as restricted cash
and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. 

        Investments
in property, plant and equipment were $185 million, an increase of $57 million from 2005. The increase in the capital expenditure was due to our site
restructuring following the semiconductor products division divestiture and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were
$207 million in 2006 as compared to $54 million in 2005. During 2006, we sold our Palo Alto site and San Jose site for a total consideration of approximately $186.5 million. We
also purchased minority interests in consolidated joint ventures for $104 million during 2006 which included primarily the remaining minority interest of 49 percent in Yokogawa
Analytical Systems for $98 million. In addition, we invested $50 million in the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash in 2006 compared to $64 million in
2005. Proceeds from the sale of short-term investments were $25 million in 2006. 

        Net
cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor products business was $6 million in 2006 as compared to cash used of
$27 million during 2005. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor test solutions business was $36 million in 2006 as compared to cash
used of $14 million during 2005. 



 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities  



        Net cash used in financing activities in 2006 was $2,548 million compared to $780 million used in 2005. 

        Our
board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion in 2005 and up to an additional $2 billion by the end of fiscal 2008. We completed
$4.466 billion stock repurchase program in 2006. In addition we also repurchased our common stock for $56 million under the 2006 program. As of October 31, 2006, we have acquired
approximately 127 million shares of our common stock under both programs. Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans were $547 million and $198 million
during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the proceeds was primarily due to the higher exercise rate of options as a result of a higher Agilent stock price and modifications to the terms of
the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business. The modification effected the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options as part of the divestiture of the semiconductor
products business. 

        We
distributed $300 million upon separation of our semiconductor test solutions business ("Verigy") on October 31, 2006. This amount was held by Verigy as of
October 31, 2006. Agilent also made a payment of $19 million pursuant to master separation agreement, the amount by which the aggregate net proceeds from Verigy IPO were less than
$140 million. For further details, see Note 4, "Discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business", to our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
January 2006, World Trade entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a counterparty pursuant to which World
Trade sold to the counterparty 15,000 Class A preferred shares having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion of its wholly owned subsidiary, which has its own assets and
liabilities, and 

52




 


received
$1.5 billion in cash. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the counterparty the preferred shares for 100 percent of their aggregate
liquidation preference in January 2011. The $1.5 billion obligation of World Trade to repurchase the preferred shares has been treated as long-term debt on our consolidated
balance sheet. 

        In
December 2005, we drew down $700 million on a $1 billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. In
January 2006, we applied $700 million of
the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006. 

        Net
cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor test solutions business was $140 million in 2006. During the third quarter of
2006, Verigy completed their initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7 million shares. In addition, the underwriters of the IPO exercised a portion of their over-allotment options.
Total proceeds from IPO and exercise of over-allotment options by underwriters were $121 million, net. Agilent made a payment of an additional $19 million pursuant to master
separation agreement, the amount by which the aggregate net proceeds from Verigy IPO were less than $140 million. 



 Other  



        We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated
financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases. 


        Our
liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and
markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain
circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. 

        On
April 13, 2005, Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of Agilent to "BB+" from "BB", revising their
rating outlook to "stable" from "positive". On August 15, 2005, S&P raised its rating outlook on Agilent to "positive", but left the company's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings
unchanged. On December 11, 2006, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded their corporate family rating and probability of default rating of Agilent from "Ba2" to "Ba1" and revised their
rating outlook to positive, leaving unchanged the speculative grade liquidity rating of "SGL-1". 



 Contractual Commitments  



        Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory
management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with
such factors.

        Operating leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property. 

        Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several
contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the
delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being
placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 36 percent of our reported purchase
commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year. 

        In
addition to the above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts
consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2006, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments was
$9 million, compared with $11 million as of October 31, 2005. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 


        Other purchase commitments.    These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments
are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties. 

        Retirement plans.    Retirement plan funding includes the expected tax-deductible contribution planned for 2007.
Funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates. 


        We
had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2006 or October 31, 2005.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        

        We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance.
Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge
certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and 

54




 


losses
on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 

        Our
operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency
cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 63 percent of our
revenues in 2006, 64 percent of our revenues in 2005 and 65 percent of our revenues in 2004 were generated in U.S. dollars. 

        We
performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described
above. As of October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

<A
NAME="page_ds1318_1_57">   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies, Inc.: 

        We
have completed integrated audits of Agilent Technologies, Inc.'s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
October 31, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below. 



 Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule  



        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" as of
November 1, 2005 and changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006. 



 Internal control over financial reporting  



        Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in  Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment
and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the 

57




 

design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinions. 

        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.     Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

        Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a measurement company, providing core
bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of
16 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84 percent of our stock to its
stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend. 

        In
the first quarter of 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. The results of our semiconductor products business are presented as a discontinued
operation for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business." In the third quarter of 2006,
we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy Ltd., ("Verigy"). Verigy was a majority-owned subsidiary of Agilent until the distribution of our
remaining Verigy shares to Agilent stockholders on October 31, 2006. The results of operations and financial position of Verigy are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent
and reported as discontinued operations. See Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business." 

        Basis of presentation.    The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all
years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 

        Management
is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and has full responsibility for their
integrity
and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet,
statement of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. 

        Reclassifications.    Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October 31, 2005 and
October 31, 2004 were reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2006. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business," Note 4, "Discontinued
Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" and Note 7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale — Lumileds" for a discussion relating
to these reclassifications. 

        Principles of consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and
majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the
equity method. 

        Use of estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events 

63




 


and
actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially
and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and asset impairment charges, share-based compensation, inventory valuation,
investment impairments, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes. 


        Revenue recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements
(multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. 

        We
recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price
is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or
when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not
to be fixed or
determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of
revenue recognition. 

        Product revenue.    Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Software
is embedded in many of our test equipment products, but the software component is generally considered to be incidental. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for
estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance
milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element,
product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is
recognized until the installation is complete. 

        Where
software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic
delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and
whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence. 

        Service revenue.    Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education.
Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the
contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service
revenue is recognized. 

        Multiple element arrangements.    We use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element
arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until 

64




 


such
criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the
fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value. 

        Deferred revenue.    Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of advanced billing and customer deposits for service, support and
maintenance agreements. 

        Accounts receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such
accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the
allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.
Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns. 

        Share-based compensation.    For the year ended 2006, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors
including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc.
Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with SFAS, No.123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS
No. 123 (R)"), which was effective November 1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations for share-based
awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for proforma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 were in effect for expense recognition
purposes. Additionally, we recorded compensation expense using the fair value method for all share-based awards granted after November 1, 2005. We recorded SFAS No. 123
(R) compensation expense in continuing operations of $94 million in 2006. See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements", for new accounting pronouncements affecting share-based
awards beginning November 1, 2005. 

        Through
year end 2005, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). Under the intrinsic value method, we recorded compensation expense related to stock options in our consolidated
statement of operations when the exercise price of our employee share-based award was less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense was also
recorded for the LTPP using the variable accounting method. We recorded APB No. 25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8 million in 2005 and $7 million in 2004. The
APB No. 25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. We issue new shares for award exercises. 

        Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in,
first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our
excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. 

65




 


        Taxes on income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. 


        Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery, but our current reserve
balance includes three year agreements from prior periods. We accrue for standard warranty costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for
Contingencies" ("SFAS No. 5"), based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of gross product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect
changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 17, "Guarantees". 


        Shipping and handling costs.    Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the
associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented. 

        Goodwill and purchased intangible assets.    Our accounting complies with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost
less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. 


        Advertising.    Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $44 million in 2006, $33 million in
2005 and $46 million in 2004 for Agilent continuing operations. 

        Research and development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and
development expense as they are incurred. 

        Sales Taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue. 


        Net income (loss) per share.    Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) —
the numerator — by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding — the denominator — during the period excluding the dilutive effect
of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing
diluted net income (loss) per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of
stock option exercises. For fiscal year 2006 the number of shares assumed to be purchased also considered the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service as required under SFAS
No. 123(R). Diluted net income per share for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 8 million, 49 million and 41 million options to
purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive. Fiscal year 2004 also excluded shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15 billion senior convertible
debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was redeemed as of
September 9, 2005 and therefore no longer outstanding nor part of the computation in 2006. 

66




 


        Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.    We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original
or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 

        Approximately
20 percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S., and 60 percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder
is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 8 percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial
institutions of high credit quality and is available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time
deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money
market funds in which we invest our surplus funds. We have not experienced any credit losses from cash investments. 

        We
classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less.
Our short-term investments consist of bank time deposits, which by their nature are
typically held to maturity, and are classified as such because we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized
cost. 

        Restricted
cash and cash equivalents was $1.6 billion in 2006, $22 million in 2005 and zero in 2004. 

        Fair value of financial instruments.    The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of equity investments is
determined using quoted market prices for those securities where available. 

        Concentration of credit risk.    We sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. No single customer
accounted for 10 percent or more of the combined accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2006 or 2005. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to
the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial
conditions and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. 

        Derivative instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter
into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are
designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures, which include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, which has the exposure. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting,
contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; hedging
contracts generally mature within twelve months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 

67




 


        The
derivatives entered into by Agilent are designated either as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in income in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument
are
recognized in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. These amounts are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it
becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Fair value hedges are recorded in net income and are offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying assets or liabilities being
hedged. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not significant. 

        We
may also, from time to time, acquire warrants or other equity types of securities to purchase securities of other companies as part of strategic relationships. 

        Property, plant and equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions,
improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated
depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated
over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We are currently using the straight-line method to depreciate
assets. 

        Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from 1 to
20 years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to 20 years. These operating leases are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." 

        Capitalized software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software
in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized software is included in property,
plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years when development is complete. 

        Impairment of long-lived assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate
carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of
long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. 


        Employee compensation and benefits    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are
accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $133 million as of October 31, 2006 and $145 million as of
October 31, 2005. 

68




 


        Foreign currency translation.    We follow SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation", for both the translation and
remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a
separate component of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. 

        For
those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for
nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange
rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss). 

2.     New Accounting Pronouncements  

        In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (R), which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense based on estimated fair value for all share-based payment awards including stock options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans, non-vested
share awards (restricted stock) and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123 (R) supersedes our previous accounting under APB No. 25. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107, which provides the Staff's views regarding implementation issues related to SFAS No. 123 (R). 

        We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method beginning November 1, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006. In
accordance with that transition method, we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under SFAS No. 123 (R). We have selected the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all our awards, except for the non-vested performance shares under the LTPP. For the LTPP,
we are using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate grant date fair value as required by SFAS No. 123 (R). Compensation expense for all share-based equity awards issued after November 1,
2005 is being
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November 1, 2005, we are recognizing compensation expense based on the
accelerated method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans" ("FIN No. 28"). The adoption of SFAS
No. 123 (R) also requires additional accounting related to income taxes and earnings per share as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from
share-based compensation. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2006, and is expected to continue to materially impact our
financial statements in the foreseeable future. See Note 5, "Share-Based Compensation" for more information on the impact of the new standard. 

        In
November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") SFAS No. 123 (R)-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards," ("FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3"). FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in
SFAS No. 123 (R). SFAS No. 123 (R) requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting SFAS
No. 123 (R) (termed the APIC Pool), assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by SFAS No. 123. We have elected to use the guidance in FSP SFAS
No. 123 (R)-3 

69




 


to
calculate our APIC Pool. FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 was effective immediately. The adoption of the FSP did not have an impact on our overall results of operations or financial
position. 

        In
June 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-3, "How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)," ("EITF No. 06-3"). EITF No. 06-3 requires disclosure of
accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of point-of-sales taxes such as sales tax and value-added tax. If taxes included in gross revenues are significant,
the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented should also be disclosed. EITF No. 06-3 will be effective for the first annual or interim
reporting period after December 15, 2006. EITF No. 06-3 requires retrospective application. We will be adopting this pronouncement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2007, and we do not expect it to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

        In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties" ("FIN No. 48"). FIN No. 48 defines the threshold for
recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority and provides guidance
on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN No. 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for
income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of
disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The differences between the amounts
recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN No. 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded
to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies only to fair value measurements
that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards (except for measurements of share-based payments) and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively with some
exceptions that will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS No. 158"), which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets. Except for the measurement date requirement, SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The
measurement date requirement will not be effective until fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158 will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact
of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our consolidated financial position. 

70




 


        In
September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB No. 108"). SAB No. 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year
misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year's financial statements are materially misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after
November 15, 2006 with earlier adoption encouraged and will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SAB No. 108 on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

3.     Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business  


        On December 1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago Technologies Ltd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2,559 million in cash proceeds. The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of discontinued operations,
net of taxes as of October 31, 2006:

        Subsequent
to the quarter ended January 31, 2006, we adjusted the gain on sale of discontinued operations by $23 million which includes $21 million for working
capital and other adjustments and $2 million for the disposal of fixed assets. The $36 million costs of disposition are reported net of a gain of $51 million for pension
curtailments and settlements. The tax impact of the sale of our semiconductor products business reflects the utilization of the valuation allowance within the U.S. and a low effective tax rate in
other jurisdictions. 

        Our
consolidated financial statements reflect our semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets."

accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and other Intangibles" ("SFAS No. 142"), approximately $98 million of goodwill associated with the semiconductor products
business was eliminated and recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale of discontinued operations. 



 Indemnifications to Avago  



        In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties
against damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well
as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10 percent of the purchase price
and survive until March 31, 2007. 

4.     Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business  

        On August 15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded
company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7 million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds
of $121 million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to 

73




 


Verigy
of $19 million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140 million. Following the
offering, Agilent owned approximately 50 million shares or 85 percent of Verigy's ordinary shares. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of
$74 million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Underwriter fees related to the IPO were approximately $9 million which were netted against the
proceeds. Agilent recorded direct IPO costs of $2 million within operating expenses related to third-party legal fees, filing fees and other services. 

        On
October 31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85 percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The
spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310 million. In the distribution, Agilent
distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October 16, 2006. In the aggregate,
Agilent distributed 50 million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 31,
2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was approximately $840 million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as
discontinued operations in the underlying financial statements and related disclosures for all periods presented.

        Prior
to the distribution of Verigy shares, Verigy and Agilent, and, in some cases, their respective subsidiaries, entered into agreements providing for the June 1, 2006
separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent, including a master separation and distribution agreement. These agreements cover a variety of matters, including the transfer,
ownership and licensing of intellectual property and other assets and liabilities relating to Verigy's businesses, the use of shared facilities, employee and tax-related matters and the
transitional services Agilent will provide to Verigy. In addition, an ancillary agreement provided for a $25 million revolving credit facility from Agilent to Verigy on the separation date with
interest at one-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. All amounts were repaid back and the credit facility has expired. The agreements relating to the separation from Agilent have been
negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship. Per the transitional services agreement, the majority of the services Agilent provided to Verigy upon separation terminated prior to the
distribution date. 



 Indemnifications to Verigy  



        In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against damages which it might incur in the future. These
indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might 

76




 

arise
under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's
remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to
the separation on June 1, 2006. 


5.     Share-Based Compensation  

        Effective November 1, 2005, Agilent adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted
to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Agilent previously applied the provisions of APB No. 25 and related Interpretations and provided the
required pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123"). 

Description of Share-Based Plans  

        Employee stock purchase plans.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Under the provisions of the ESPP,
eligible employees may contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or
the purchase date as defined by the ESPP. The ESPP has a maximum contractual term of two years. As of October 31, 2006, securities authorized and available for issuance in connection with our
ESPP were 23,341,919. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or
an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP
exceed 75 million shares. 

        Incentive compensation plans.    On September 17, 1999, we adopted the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan
(the "Stock Plan") and subsequently reserved 67,800,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. In addition, on May 31, 2000, 19,000,000 shares of our common stock were
registered pursuant to converted stock options previously granted by HP. In February 2001, our stockholders approved an additional 45,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the
Stock Plan. These shares were subsequently registered in May 2002. At October 31, 2006, shares registered and available for option and restricted stock grants were 36,639,572. 

        Stock
options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards may be granted under the Stock Plan. Options granted under the Stock Plan may be either "incentive stock options",
as defined in section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of
grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the
date the stock award is granted. 

        On
March 4, 2003, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Plan. The amendment permitted the company to offer a one-time exchange of options issued under
the Stock Plan having an exercise price greater than $25 for a lesser number of options to be granted at least six months and one day from the cancellation of surrendered options (the "Option Exchange
Program"). On May 20, 2003, we implemented the Option Exchange Program by filing a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC, which 

77




 


allowed
eligible employees a one-time opportunity to exchange options to purchase shares of the company's common stock, whether vested or unvested, which were granted under our Stock Plan,
with exercise prices greater than $25 per share. The Option Exchange Program was offered from May 20, 2003 to June 18, 2003 and options to purchase approximately 26 million shares
were exchanged, with an average exercise price of $51. As a result, the company issued options to purchase approximately 13.8 million shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $28 per
share during the first quarter of 2004. Under the provisions of APB No. 25 no compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for issuance of the replacement
options for fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004. As a result of the SFAS No. 123 (R) adoption, in fiscal year ended 2006, we recognized approximately $3 million in our consolidated
statement of operations for the issuance of these replacement options. 

        Effective
November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP for the company's executive officers and other key employees beginning in 2006.
Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. The maximum
contractual term for awards under the LTPP plan is three years. The following table summarizes the shares approved by the Compensation Committee to be issued under the LTPP:

        In
all cases, the final award may vary as it is based on certain performance metrics. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income per share calculation only
to the extent that the performance conditions are met. 

Pro forma Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R)  

        Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), Agilent provided the disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosures." No employee share-based compensation expense was reflected in our results from continuing operations in 2005
and 2004 for employee stock option awards as all options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP was deemed
non-compensatory under the provisions of APB No. 25. Compensation expense for the non-vested performance shares granted under the LTPP was recognized based on the grant
date fair value for the respective grants. Forfeitures of awards were recognized as they occurred. We recorded APB No. 25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8 million in
2005 and $7 million in 2004. The APB No. 25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. In August 2005 our Board of Directors approved a modification to
the terms of the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business to effect the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options held by employees of that business, effective as of the
date of the sale of the semiconductor products business to Avago. In connection with this modification, we recorded $8 million of compensation expense in discontinued operations.

        The
pro forma results in 2005 and 2004 include approximately $32 million and $70 million of pro forma compensation expense relating to our Option Exchange Program,
respectively. The remainder of the expense for those periods related to awards granted over the previous four years. 

        Due
to the valuation allowance provided on our net deferred tax assets as described in Note 8, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations", we did not record
any tax benefits attributable to pro forma share-based compensation expenses for employees in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions in 2005 and 2004. The tax impact presented above was
computed for both the APB No. 25 and SFAS No. 123 share-based compensation expense. 

Impact of SFAS No. 123 (R)  

        Agilent adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method beginning November 1, 2005. Accordingly, in 2006, we
recorded share-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS
No. 123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The effect of forfeitures on the unamortized compensation expense of pre-adoption awards was not
material. For these awards, we have continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under FIN No. 28. For share-based awards granted after
November 1, 2005 we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under SFAS No. 123 (R). For these awards we have recognized
compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As SFAS No. 123 (R) requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately
expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation in 2006 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Amounts previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) have not
been restated.

        At
October 31, 2006 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory as it was immaterial. Total income tax benefit recognized in 2006 in the statement of
operations for share-based compensation was immaterial. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No. 123 (R), granted in 2006 was $10.46 per share. The
total fair value of shares vested in 2006 was $216 million. In 2006 the windfall tax benefit realized from exercised stock options and similar awards was immaterial. As of October 31,
2006, the total unrecorded deferred share-based compensation balance for non-vested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $88 million which is expected to be
amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. 

        Included
in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) for the
fiscal year ended 2006 is approximately $3 million of share-based compensation expense in connection with the 2005 modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our divested
semiconductor products business. 

80




 

        Included
in income from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) is $9 million of
share-based compensation expense for Agilent options held by Verigy employees and $2 million of new Verigy awards that were issued prior to the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent.
As a result of the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent which took place on October 31, 2006, non-vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees were cancelled.
Vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees will have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. Retirement eligible Verigy
employees will have a period of up to three years in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. To the extent that the Agilent options were not vested as of the
distribution date, Verigy issued replacement Verigy awards. 

Valuation Assumptions  

        For all periods presented, the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards, restricted stock and employee stock purchases made under our
ESPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In 2006, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. In 2005 and 2004, shares granted under the LTPP were
valued using the variable accounting method under APB No. 25. 

        The
weighted average assumptions used for options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

<A
NAME="page_eg1318_1_82">  

        Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected
life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Beginning November 1, 2005, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility for our stock.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption. We have determined that implied volatility
is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of
our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future
behavior.

        The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock
price of $35.60 at October 31, 2006, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date.
The total number of in-the-money awards exercisable at October 31, 2006 was approximately 33 million.

        Interest
income is derived principally from short-term commercial paper for our restricted investments and the investment of our surplus cash balances in bank time deposits
and other money market instruments. Income from Foreign Sales Corporation Tax Study was earned pursuant to an agreement with Hewlett-Packard to provide assistance with a Foreign Sales Corporation
Maximization

Study
for years prior to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. For its services, Agilent earned a fee which was contingent on related tax benefits being realized. 

7.     Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale — Lumileds  

        Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds"), was a global joint venture between Agilent and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("Philips") under a Second
Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), dated as of November 29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds manufactures high-power light
emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Our ownership interest in Lumileds was approximately 47 percent as of October 31, 2005, after selling 1 percent of our interest
to Philips in the second quarter of 2005. Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901 million in 2006,
$42 million in 2005 and $29 million in 2004. 

        On
November 28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement
and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949 million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51 million of
outstanding principal debt and accrued interest due to us as of the date of sale under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2001.

        The
consolidated balance sheet reflects the allocation of the valuation allowance based on the pro-rata portion of gross current and non-current deferred tax
assets in each jurisdiction where a valuation allowance is required. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign
jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining
whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in
the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances
until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. 

        At
October 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $256 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $145 million. The
federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2007 through 2021, if not utilized. The federal tax credits expire beginning in 2007 through 2026, if not utilized. In addition, the company has
state tax credit carryforwards of $133 million. State tax credits of $18 million expire beginning in 2007 through
2018, if not utilized. A portion of the federal and state net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code
and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses and/or credits. At October 31, 2006, we also had
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $390 million. Of this foreign loss, $127 million will expire in years beginning 2011 through 2014, if not utilized. The
remaining $263 million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules. 

        Net
deferred tax assets of approximately $79 million at October 31, 2006 and approximately $32 million at October 31, 2005 pertain to net operating loss
carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. When recognized, the reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted
for as a credit to shareholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.

        The
income tax provision for 2006 includes a benefit of $29 million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing
Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. 

        On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed
cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970 million and a related tax liability of approximately $48 million in our fiscal
2005 federal and state income tax returns. For fiscal 2005, $23 million of the $48 million is provided for in the discontinuing operations' provision for income taxes while the remaining
is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes. 

        Agilent
has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our policy is to continue to invest the undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the United States, with the exception of the amounts repatriated in the year ended October 31, 2005 under the AJCA. If management decides to remit
this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. 

        Agilent
enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain
classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. During the years 2003 through 2006, Agilent enjoyed tax holidays that applied to manufacturing
income generated in Malaysia and Singapore. The tax holidays in both Malaysia and Singapore expire in 2013. In 2004, Agilent secured a reduced tax rate in Switzerland for income generated from
activity that Agilent began in Switzerland during that year. The tax holiday expires in 2013. Also in 2004, Agilent secured an additional Singapore tax holiday for earnings from investments and
related activity that began in 2004. The tax holiday applies to applicable earnings of Agilent until the end of 2013, with the opportunity for a reduced rate thereafter. 

        As
a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $76 million, $54 million and $96 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.17, $0.11 and $0.20 in 2006, 2005 and 2003, respectively. 

88




 


        We
are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of
income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be
unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

        In
computing diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method, we elected to use the transition election of FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 to determine the pool of
windfall tax benefits as of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R). For further details see Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements." The total number of awards exercised in 2006, 2005 and 2004
was 19 million, 5 million and 3 million, respectively. 

        In
connection with the October 31, 2006 Verigy distribution, on November 1, 2006 Agilent distributed .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of
Agilent common stock owned as of October 16, 2006 to Agilent's stockholders. In addition, under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November 1, 2006
Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off.
For further details on the distribution see Note 5, "Share-Based Compensation."

        The
computation of diluted net income per share for the fiscal year 2004 does not include 36 million shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15 billion
senior convertible debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was
redeemed as of September 9, 2005 and therefore not part of the computation in 2006. 

10.   Supplemental Cash Flow Information  

        Cash paid for income taxes was $156 million in 2006, $75 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. Cash paid for interest was
$55 million in 2006, $44 million in 2005 and $36 million in 2004. In 2006, we spent $25 million as debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt of
$1.5 billion and amortized $4 million in interest expense during 2006. 

        Non
cash transactions in 2005 primarily related to the conversion of approximately $466 million of the principal amount of convertible debt into common stock. In addition, accrued
interest of approximately $4 million relating to the convertible debt was recorded in equity as part of the cost of the new shares issued. Non-cash transactions in 2004 related
primarily to an acquisition in October 2004 and we issued approximately 772,000 shares with an approximate value of $18 million. 


11.   Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents  

        As of October 31, 2006, $1,606 million was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount,
$1,582 million was short-term restricted commercial paper maintained in connection with our obligations to a counterparty pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement and related
Confirmation entered into on January 27, 2006 and reported as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 21, "Long-Term Debt and Credit
Facilities."

        We
purchased $69 million of other intangibles and recorded $76 million of goodwill during 2006. 

        In
February 2006, we acquired the remaining 49 percent minority interest in Yokogawa Analytical Systems, a joint venture between Agilent and Yokogawa Electrical
Corporation. This acquisition resulted in the recording of $43 million in intangible assets and $60 million of goodwill. In addition, during 2006 we recorded two acquisitions, one earn
out payment on an acquisition completed in 2005, and one joint venture buyout payment. Pro forma disclosures are not presented for these transactions as they were not material. 


        Amortization
of intangible assets was $24 million in 2006, $13 million in 2005 and $17 million in 2004. Future amortization expense related to existing intangible
assets is estimated to be $27 million in 2007, $19 million in 2008, $12 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010, $7 million in 2011 and $8 million thereafter. 

15.   Investments  

        Investments in cost basis and equity method investments and securities classified as trading securities or available-for-sale and included
in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet were as follows at October 31, 2006 and 2005 (net book value):

<A
NAME="page_ek1318_1_93">  

        Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. For investments where we have
significant influence over the investee, the equity method of accounting is used. Agilent's proportionate share of income or loss for equity method investments was recorded currently in earnings.
Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in operating earnings. Investments designated as
available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. 

        All
of our investments (excluding trading securities) are subject to periodic impairment review. However, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or
circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. 


        Charges
related to other than temporary impairments were $1 million in 2006, $18 million in 2005 and $15 million in 2004. These impairment charges were recorded in
other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. 

        Unrealized
gains and losses on our trading securities portfolio were $6 million gain in 2006 and $5 million gain in both 2005 and 2004. Realized gains and losses from the
sale of available-for-sale securities was $9 million in 2006, $8 million in 2005 and zero in 2004. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
held-to-maturity securities was $2 million in 2006, zero in 2005 and zero in 2004. 


        In
the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we sold our remaining interest in Lumileds to Philips. See Note 7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on
Sale — Lumileds "for further details. 

16.   Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans  

        General.    Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution plans.
Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees. 

        Agilent
provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement and deferred profit-sharing plans, defined benefits which are generally based on an employee's highest
five consecutive years' average pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan
is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. 


        As
of October 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of plan assets and the total projected benefit obligation of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees were $726 million and
$826 million, respectively. 

        Eligible
employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and employee compensation levels.
Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January 1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is
part of the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan. In July 2004, the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on
or after January 1, 2005. 

93




 


        401(k) defined contribution plan.    Our U.S. eligible employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k)
Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching
contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual
eligible compensation, subject to regulatory and plan limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense included in income (loss) from continuing operations was $26 million in 2006, $25 million in
2005 and $25 million in 2004. 

        Post-retirement medical benefit plans.    In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet
retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical or Medicare Medical Plans (the "Post-retirement Medical Plans")
under the Agilent Health Plan. Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Once participating in a medical
plan, retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with their contributions dependent on the options chosen and length of service. 

        Plan amendments.    In July 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to
Agilent's Post-retirement Medical Plans. One option available to existing post-65 retirees is a new Medicare Supplement Plan in 2005. The Medicare Supplement Plan supplements
Medicare coverage by reimbursing Medicare Parts A and B deductibles at 100 percent after Medicare pays its portion of the retiree's expenses. The Post-retirement Medical Plan for a
majority of future retirees was revised to establish retiree medical accounts for the benefit of such retirees and will be funded with amounts as determined by Agilent. 

        Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.    In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May 2004, the FASB issued
FSP 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003", which provides guidance on how companies should
account for the impact of the Act on its postretirement healthcare plans. Beginning in 2006, the federal government provides a non-taxable subsidy to employers that sponsor prescription
drug benefits to retirees that are "actuarially equivalent" to Medicare Part D benefits. We have determined that the prescription drug benefits offered under our plans qualify for this subsidy
and assuming that we will continue to offer these benefits, we have reflected the expected subsidy according to the guidance in FSP 106-2 prospectively in our financial statements. The
adoption of FSP 106-2 had no material impact on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net plan costs.

        As
of December 1, 2005, due to the divestiture of the semiconductor products business, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No. 88,
"Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," ("SFAS No. 88") and as required under the SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("SFAS No. 106"). The impact to the U.S. Plans and the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was curtailment gains of
$22 million and $21 million, recorded in discontinued operations. The impact on the Non-U.S. Plans was a settlement gain of $8 million recorded in discontinued
operations. 

        Due
to the separation of our semiconductor test solutions business into a separate legal company, Verigy, as of June 1, 2006, and due to significant workforce reductions, we
recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No. 88 and SFAS No. 106 in the third quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was a curtailment gain of $12 million
consisting of curtailment gain of $3 million for
continuing operations and curtailment gain of $9 million for discontinued operations as well as a $4 million settlement gain relating to continuing operations. The impact to the U.S.
Post Retirement Benefit Plan was a curtailment gain of $12 million for continuing operations. The impact to the Non-U.S. Plans was a curtailment loss of $1 million and a
settlement gain of $4 million, that were recorded in discontinued operations. 


        In
the U.S., because of additional workforce reductions along with cessation of retiree medical benefits for Verigy employees as of October 31, 2006, we recorded curtailments and
settlements as required by SFAS No. 88 and SFAS No. 106 in the fourth quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was 

95




 


curtailment
gains of $2 million and a settlement gain of $2 million both of which were for continuing operations. For the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan, we recorded a curtailment
gain of $5 million which was for discontinued operations. 

        Funded status.    As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, the funded status of the defined benefit and

        Investment policies and strategies as of October 31, 2005 and 2006.    Plan assets consist primarily of publicly-traded
stocks and bonds. In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit assets are allocated approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent
to fixed income investments. Our DPSP assets are allocated approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 10 percent
of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of alternative investments, largely private equity partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of
investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a
well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment
objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn
performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our assets are allocated from 50 to 70 percent to equities, from 25 to
50 percent to fixed income investments, and from 0 to 5 percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. The actual allocations of
plan assets are consistent with the target allocations. 

        The
table below presents the projected benefit obligation ("PBO"), accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") and fair value of plan assets in the aggregate for all plans, separately showing
those that were considered under-funded as of October 31, 2006 or 2005.

        Additional Minimum Liability.    An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2005 for three pension plans
in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated
comprehensive loss was $170 million, which was partially offset by $20 million applied to deferred tax assets, net of tax valuation allowance. The large impact on accumulated
comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries. 


        On
June 1, 2006, in accordance with the separation agreement between Agilent and Verigy, the liability for certain Verigy employee pension benefits was transferred to separate
Verigy pension plans. Agilent funded the pension liability to the extent of the accumulated benefit obligation out of operating cash. The funded status of the Non-U.S. plans required us to
reverse $58 million of the additional minimum liability along with the related deferred tax impacts, of approximately $20 million. 

        An
additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2006 for two pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan
assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive gain (loss) was $112 million which was partially offset by
$34 million
applied to deferred tax assets. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries. 

        Contributions and estimated future benefit payments.    During fiscal year 2007, we expect to contribute zero to the U.S.
defined benefit plans, $39 million to plans outside the U.S., and zero to the

Medical Plans. The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years:

        Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and
post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on
investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates
of return, which are weighted based, on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect
the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans — October 31 for the U.S. plans and
September 30 for the non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against the cash flows from a hypothetically constructed
portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as a proxy for setting the discount rate. The non-U.S. rates were generally based
on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments
within various countries.

 Lease Guarantees  



        During the quarter ended April 30, 2005 we entered into an amended Vendor Finance agreement with CIT Group Inc. (formerly Tyco Capital Corporation)
that released Agilent from substantially all credit guarantees. As part of this agreement Agilent was also released of liability relating to the guarantees that could require us to repurchase
individual leases if the documentation we provided to support the lease was not materially accurate. The impact of the agreement was not material. 



 Indemnifications to Avago  



        In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties
against certain damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago,
as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10 percent of the
purchase price and survive until March 31, 2007. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 



 Indemnifications to Verigy  



        In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the
future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of
Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary
shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June 1, 2006.
In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 



 Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard  



        We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that
constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and
environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on
August 16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 



 Indemnifications to Officers and Directors  



        Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at
our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent. In
addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers
under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase
standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the 

102




 

claims
made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and
circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations,
and the fair value for these obligations was zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2006. 



 Other Indemnifications  



        As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our
customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we
indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of
loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of
our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also
provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such
indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2006. 

18.   Commitments and Contingencies  

        Operating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under
non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases related to continuing operations at October 31, 2006 were $79 million for 2007,
$62 million for 2008, $44 million for 2009, $25 million for 2010, $16 million for 2011 and $37 million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at
October 31, 2006 was $12 million for 2007, $10 million for 2008, $6 million for 2009, $2 million for 2010 and zero for 2011. Certain leases require us to pay
property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including amounts recorded in discontinued operations, was $112 million in 2006,
$90 million in 2005 and $116 million in 2004. Rent expense recorded in discontinued operations was $2 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $25 million in 2004. 

        We
are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in
relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

19.   Restructuring and Asset Impairment  

        We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). The workforce reduction portion of the
Prior Plans was completed during fiscal year 2005. The consolidation of excess facilities portion of Prior Plans is expected to be completed within approximately the next five years. In addition,
there may be future changes in estimates for the consolidation of excess facilities related to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the time the charges were recorded. 

103




 


        In
the fourth quarter of 2005, as a consequence of the decision to divest the semiconductor products and semiconductor test solutions businesses, we launched a new restructuring program
(the "2005 Plan") to align our workforce with our smaller organizational size. The 2005 Plan consists purely of workforce reduction initiatives, and is primarily focused on reducing the costs
associated with the shared services functions.

        The
restructuring accrual for all plans, which totaled $71 million at October 31, 2006 and $93 million at October 31, 2005, is recorded in other accrued
liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represents estimated future cash outlays. Workforce reduction expenses, primarily severance, are expected
to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2007. In 2006, we consolidated several facilities due to changes in our organizational structure and recorded impairment charges of $42 million.
These charges were primarily associated with facilities located in Germany and the US.

        Amounts
owed to our employees for accrued vacation totaled $133 million and $145 million at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is recorded in employee
compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. 


21.   Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities  

        In January 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc., a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade"), entered into a Master
Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a third party pursuant to which World Trade sold 15,000 Class A preferred shares of one of its wholly
owned subsidiaries having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the third party those preferred
shares for 100 percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January 2011. The $1.5 billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been
classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The related debt issuance costs of $25 million were deferred and recognized in other assets on our consolidated
balance sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Repurchase Agreement. 

        Under
the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the third party at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 28 basis
points. Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the third party the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default
but no financial covenants. Under the Repurchase Agreement, our subsidiary has the right to accelerate the repurchase of all or any portion of the preferred shares prior to January 2011. 


        In
connection with the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade's wholly owned subsidiary is required to hold short-term investments. As of October 31, 2006, these
investments were approximately $1,582 million and were classified within restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 11, "Restricted Cash and Cash
Equivalents." 

        In
December 2005, we drew down $700 million on a $1 billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. The term facility
allowed us a one-time borrowing at an interest rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum. In January 2006, we applied $700 million of the
proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the secured term borrowing facility. Total interest expense on the senior secured term borrowing facility was
$3.6 million. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006. 

22.   Stock Repurchase Program  

        During the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion of our common stock. Under the
program, we repurchased 8.9 million shares for $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. 


        In
the first quarter of 2006, under a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, we agreed to accept for payment 83 million shares at a purchase price of $36 per share for an
aggregate amount of approximately $3 billion. In June 2006, we completed our stock repurchase program which was announced in fourth quarter of 2005. Under the program, we repurchased a
total of approximately 125 million shares of our common stock for $4.466 billion. In addition, we capitalized $3 million of service and legal fees. 

106




 


        During
the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion of our common stock. Under the new program, we
repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. 

        As
of October 31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 127 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.5 billion. All such shares and related costs
are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. 


23.   Segment Information  

        Description of segments.    We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement
solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off
of our semiconductor test solutions business. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test
Solutions Business" for further information. Following this reorganization, Agilent has two businesses — bio-analytical measurement and electronic
measurement — each of which comprises a reportable segment. The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our
operations. Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining our reportable segments. 

        A
description of our two remaining reportable segments is as follows: 



•Bio-analytical
measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to
identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include microarrays, microfluidics, gas chromatography, liquid
chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services;
•Electronic
measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems, monitoring, management and optimization tools for
communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment
and communications networks and services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also
offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle. 


        Segment revenue and profit.    The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those
described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies". 

        A
significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically managed centrally in order to realize economies of scale and to
efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, real estate, insurance
services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to 

107




 


the
segments, and the allocations are determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. After its
separation on June 1, 2006, Agilent started billing our semiconductor test solutions business for their use of shared services under the transition services agreement. Corporate charges
previously allocated to our semiconductor products business and semiconductor test systems business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments.
These charges are presented below as a component of the reconciliation between the segments' income from operations and Agilent's income from continuing operations and are classified as unallocated
semiconductor products business corporate charges and unallocated semiconductor test systems business corporate charges. 

        The
following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. For example, share-based compensation, restructuring, and other items are excluded from the segment measure of income (loss) from operations. The performance of each segment is
measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income (loss) from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in
allocating resources to, each of the segments. 

        The
profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income,
interest expense, amortization of goodwill, amortization and impairment of other intangibles and other items as noted in the reconciliation below.

        In
2005 and 2004, revenue classified as discontinued operations included an adjustment of $1 million and $2 million respectively that was previously allocated to our
semiconductor test solution business. As a result, total reportable segment revenue was higher than Agilent net revenue by $1 million and $2 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004
respectively.

        Major customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2006, 2005 or 2004. 

        Unallocated
assets primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, the valuation allowance
relating to deferred tax assets and other assets. In 2006, we refined the methodology for allocating corporate assets, the largest component of which relates to deferred tax assets before the
valuation adjustment. Also, in 2006, we disposed a portion of our equity investments and the remaining balance of $16 million was reclassified to available for sale securities. The following
table reflects the updated measure of segment assets, capital expenditures and investments in equity-method investees directly managed by each segment. All historical amounts have been reclassified to

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  



        Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2006, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2006, the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by
Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the company's reports filed under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 



 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  



        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of October 31, 2006. 

        Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 



 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  



        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during Agilent's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
