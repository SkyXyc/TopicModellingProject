Item 1A. Risk Factors.
You should consider the following risks and all of the other information in this Annual Report in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not
  presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, 
12



our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely affected.
The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including large multinational consumer products companies. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. Most
  of our products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product segment. Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, quality of products and packaging, perceived value and quality of brands, innovation, in-store presence and visibility, promotional activities,
  advertising, editorials, e-commerce and mobile-commerce initiatives and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas or whether new competitors will emerge in the beauty business, including competitors who offer comparable products at
  more attractive prices. In particular, the fragrances segment in the United States is being influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels, including private label brands and cheaper brands that have increased pricing pressure.
  In addition, further technological breakthroughs, new product offerings by competitors, and the strength and success of our competitors’ marketing programs may impede our growth and the implementation of our business strategy. Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our
  products, both power brands and other brands, including our continued leadership in fragrances, growth and innovation in color cosmetics and growth in skin & body care, the success of our branding, innovation and execution strategies, our ability to acquire or enter into new licenses and to continue to act
  as licensee of choice for various brands, the continued diversity of our product offerings to help us compete effectively, the successful management of new product introductions and innovations, our success in entering new markets and expanding our business in existing geographies, the success of any
  future acquisitions and our ability to protect our intellectual property. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively on a global basis, it could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Rapid changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to industry trends and changes in consumer preferences for fragrances, color cosmetics and skin & body care products, consumer attitudes toward our industry and brands and in where and
  how consumers shop for those products. We must continually work to develop, produce and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. Net revenues and
  margins on beauty products tend to decline as they advance in their life cycles, so our net revenues and margins could suffer if we do not successfully and continuously develop new products. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences,
  consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. Additionally, due to the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared, trends and tastes may continue to change even more quickly. If we are unable to
  anticipate and respond to trends in the market for beauty and related products and changing consumer demands, our financial results may suffer.
Our success depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy.
Our future growth, profitability and cash flows depend upon our ability to successfully implement our global business strategy, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      develop our power brands portfolio through branding, innovation and execution;
    
  


13






  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    identify and incubate new and existing brands with the potential to develop into global power brands;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    innovate and develop new products that are appealing to the consumer;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    extend our brands into the other segments of the beauty industry in which we compete and develop new brands;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    acquire or enter into new licenses;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    expand our geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging markets;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    continue to expand our distribution channels within existing geographies to increase market presence, brand recognition and sales;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    expand our market presence through alternative distribution channels;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    expand margins through sales growth, the development of higher margin products and supply chain integration and efficiency initiatives;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    effectively manage capital investments and working capital to improve the generation of cash flow; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    execute any acquisitions quickly and efficiently and integrate businesses successfully.
    
  



There can be no assurance that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above initiatives in the manner or time period that we expect. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments which may result in short-term costs without generating any current net revenues and, therefore, may
  be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term. In addition, we may decide to divest or discontinue certain brands or streamline operations and incur other costs or special charges in doing so. We cannot give any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated strategic benefits we
  expect our strategy will achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or realize the full intended benefit of acquisitions we undertake.
During the past several years, we have explored and undertaken opportunities to acquire other companies and assets as part of our growth strategy. The assets we have acquired in the past several years represent a significant portion of our net assets. In fiscal 2011 we acquired four businesses:
  Philosophy, OPI, Dr. Scheller and TJoy. We will continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in additional selected acquisitions that would complement our current product offerings, expand our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer operating
  efficiency opportunities and growth potential. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or otherwise realize the full intended benefit of such transactions. For example, we recently
  experienced an unanticipated leadership change at TJoy after we acquired it which, combined with less favorable trade conditions in China, has resulted in TJoy performing below our expectations and impairments of trademarks. Similarly, Philosophy earned lower net revenues than expected in the first
  fiscal year after its acquisition primarily due to delays in planned international market product distribution expansion, which also resulted in impairments of trademarks. See “—Our goodwill and other assets have been subject to impairment and may continue to be subject to impairment in the future” and
  “—The purchase price of future acquisitions may not be representative of the operations acquired.” Our failure to achieve intended benefits from any future acquisitions could cause a material adverse effect on our results, business or financial condition.
Our acquisition activities may present managerial, integration, operational and financial risks.
Our acquisition activities expose us to certain risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses and potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses. If required, the financing for an acquisition could increase our indebtedness, dilute the 
14



interests of our stockholders or both. The assumptions we use to evaluate acquisition opportunities may not prove to be accurate, and intended benefits may not be realized. In addition, acquisitions of foreign businesses entail certain particular risks, including difficulties in markets and environments where
  we lack a significant presence, including inability to seize opportunities available in those markets in comparison to our global or local competitors. For example, our growth strategy may require us to seek market penetration through sales channels with which we are not familiar, which may be the
  dominant sales channels in the relevant geographies. To the extent we acquire businesses located in countries or jurisdictions with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent cost of the acquisition, as well as future profits and revenues, may be adversely impacted should exchange
  rates vary in unexpected ways. We may experience difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses. For example, after our acquisition of TJoy, a significant portion of TJoy’s former management departed earlier than expected. Even if we are able to integrate our acquired businesses, such transactions
  involve the risk of unanticipated or unknown liabilities, including with respect to environmental and regulatory matters. Our failure to successfully integrate any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political, regulatory, economic and reputational risks.
We currently have offices in more than 30 countries and market, sell and distribute our products in over 130 countries and territories. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to grow in emerging markets including expanding our operations in China and Russia and building our business in
  Brazil and South East Asia. In addition, our acquisitions and operations in some emerging markets may be subject to greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than are common in established areas.
Although we have implemented policies, procedures and trainings designed to ensure compliance with anti-bribery laws, trade controls and economic sanctions, and similar regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business
  operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. We may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur, which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
The United States has imposed export controls and economic sanctions that prohibit export or re-export of products subject to U.S. jurisdiction to specified end users and destinations, and/or prohibit U.S. companies and other U.S. persons from engaging in business activities with certain persons,
  entities, countries or governments that it determines are adverse to U.S. foreign policy interests, including Iran and Syria. In 2012, we determined that our majority-owned subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) had re-exported certain of our products manufactured in the U.S. to Syria, which
  may have been in violation of U.S. export control laws. We have taken remedial action to cease further sales to Syria. See “Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding such sales and the status of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s Office of Export
  Enforcement (“OEE”) investigation and “—We may incur penalties and experience other adverse effects on our business as a result of possible EAR violations” for additional information regarding risks related to such sales. In addition, some of the affiliate’s Syria sales were made to a party that was
  designated as a target of U.S. economic sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We have also recently determined that the same affiliate had re-exported some of our products to Iran through an intermediary UAE entity. We ceased all sales to the
  OFAC-designated party in January 2010 and have ceased all sales to Iran, Syria and OFAC-designated parties. We do not believe these sales constituted a violation of U.S. trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We may experience reputational harm and increased regulatory scrutiny as a result of our
  subsidiary’s sales to Syria and Iran. In addition, the U.S. may impose additional sanctions at any time on other countries where we sell our products. If so, our existing activities may be adversely affected, or we may incur costs in order to come into compliance with future sanctions, depending on the
  nature of any further sanctions that may be imposed.
15



Under U.S. law, U.S. companies and their controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are prohibited from participating in unsanctioned foreign boycotts. Currently, the United States considers the Arab League boycott of Israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott. In the course of our
  internal investigation into compliance with U.S. export laws by our majority-owned subsidiary in the UAE, we determined that the subsidiary may have violated U.S. anti-boycott laws by certifying on invoices (including some that involved goods manufactured in the United States) that the orders did not
  contain any materials of Israeli origin. See “—We may incur penalties and experience other adverse effects on our business as a result of possible EAR violations” for additional information regarding risks related to such certifications.
In addition, some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate non-U.S. companies which had not, until our acquisition, been subject to U.S. law. In many countries outside of the United States, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for persons to engage in
  business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or similar local anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials
  for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We may incur penalties and experience other adverse effects on our business as a result of possible EAR violations.
In 2012, we determined that our majority-owned subsidiary in the UAE had re-exported certain of our products to Syria in transactions that may constitute violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) enforced by the OEE. We voluntarily reported the transactions to OEE in
  December 2012 and submitted our final voluntary report in June 2013 and undertook remedial action to prevent any further such transactions, including auditing the subsidiary and notifying each of the subsidiary’s employees and distributors of the current U.S. sanctions and export control laws and asking
  that each distributor acknowledge the same. We also notified OFAC of our voluntary disclosure to the OEE.
OEE is in receipt of our final voluntary report. The agency is still reviewing the possible violations. The OEE investigation may take many months to complete, and we do not know when OEE will make a final determination.
In the course of our internal investigation into compliance by our majority-owned subsidiary in the UAE with U.S. export control laws, we also determined that the subsidiary may have violated EAR anti-boycott laws by including a legend on invoices confirming that the corresponding goods did not
  contain materials of Israeli origin. A number of the invoices involved U.S.-origin goods. We made an initial voluntary disclosure of the potential violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Antiboycott Compliance (“OAC”) in January 2013 and undertook
  remedial action to prevent any further inclusion of the legends on invoices. We submitted our final voluntary disclosure to OAC in June 2013.
Penalties for EAR violations can be significant and civil penalties can be imposed on a strict liability basis, without any showing of knowledge or willfulness. OEE and OAC each have wide discretion to settle claims for violations. We believe that a penalty or penalties that would result in a material
  loss are reasonably possible. Irrespective of any penalty, we could suffer other adverse effects on our business as a result of any violations or the potential violations, including legal costs and harm to our reputation, and we also will incur costs associated with our efforts to improve our compliance
  procedures. We have not established a reserve for potential penalties. We do not know whether OEE or OAC will assess a penalty or what the amount of any penalty would be, if a penalty or penalties were assessed. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingencies” in our notes to Consolidated Financial
  Statements.

Our business is dependent upon certain licenses.
Products covering a significant portion of our net revenues are marketed under exclusive license agreements which grant us and/or our subsidiaries the rights to use certain intellectual property (trademarks, trade dress, names and likeness, etc.) in certain fields on a worldwide and/or regional basis. As
  of June 30, 2013, we maintained 43 license agreements, which collectively accounted for 59% of our net revenues in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, our top six licensed brands collectively accounted for 40% of our net revenues, and each represented between 3% and 17% of net revenues. The termination of
  one or more of our license agreements or the renewal of a license agreement on less favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we may enter into additional license agreements in the future, the terms of such license
  agreements may be less favorable than the terms of our existing license agreements.
We rely on our licensors to manage and maintain their brands. Many of our licenses are with celebrities whose public personae we believe are in line with our business strategy. Since we do not maintain control over such celebrities’ brand and image, however, they are subject to change at any time
  without notice, and there can be no assurance that these celebrity licensors will maintain the appropriate celebrity status or positive association among the consumer public to maintain sales of products bearing their names and likeness at the projected sales levels. Similarly, since we are not responsible for
  the brand or image of our designer licensors, sales of related products or projected sales of related products could suffer if the designer suffers a general decline in the popularity of its brands due to mismanagement, changes in fashion or consumer preferences, or other factors beyond our control.
Our existing licenses run for varying periods with varying renewal options and may be terminated if certain conditions, such as royalty payments, are not met. These licenses impose various obligations on us which we believe are common to many licensing relationships in the beauty industry. These
  obligations include:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      maintaining the quality of the licensed product and the applicable trademarks;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    permitting the licensor’s involvement in and, in some cases, approval of advertising, packaging and marketing plans;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    paying royalties at minimum levels and/or maintaining minimum sales levels;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    actively promoting the sales of the licensed product;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    spending a certain amount of net sales on marketing and advertising for the licensed product;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    maintaining the integrity of the specified distribution channel for the licensed product;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    expanding the sales of the product and/or the jurisdictions in which the product is sold;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    agreeing not to enter into licensing arrangements with competitors of certain of our licensors;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    indemnifying the licensor in the event of product liability or other claims related to our products;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    limiting assignment and sub-licensing to third parties without the licensor’s consent; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    in some cases, requiring notice to the licensor or its approval of certain changes in control.
    
  




If we breach any of these obligations or any other obligations set forth in any of our license agreements, our rights under the license agreements that we have breached could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success is also partially dependent on the reputation of our licensors and the goodwill associated with their intellectual property. Our licensors’ reputation or goodwill may be harmed due to factors outside our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
  and results of operations. In addition, in the event that any of our licensors were to enter bankruptcy proceedings, we could lose our rights to use the intellectual property that the applicable licensors license us to use.
17



If we are unable to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, in particular trademarks, patents and copyrights, or if our brand partners and licensors are unable to maintain and protect their intellectual property rights that we use in connection with our products, our ability to
  compete could be negatively impacted.
Our intellectual property is a valuable asset of our business. For example, the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our owned and licensed brands. Although certain of our intellectual property is registered in the United
  States and in several of the foreign countries in which we operate, there can be no assurances with respect to the rights associated with such intellectual property in those countries, including our ability to register, use or defend key trademarks. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade dress, patent,
  copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, these laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited and uncertain protection and any of our intellectual property rights may
  be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, including by counterfeiters as discussed under “—The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business,” which could adversely affect our
  competitive position or ability to sell our products. In addition, our intellectual property portfolio in many foreign countries is less extensive than our portfolio in the United States, and the laws of foreign countries, including many emerging markets in which we operate, such as China, may not protect
  our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and patents may be substantial.
In addition, we may fail to apply for, or be unable to obtain, intellectual property protection for certain aspects of our business. For example, we cannot provide assurance that our applications for patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be granted, or, if granted, will provide
  meaningful protection. In addition, third parties have in the past and could in the future bring infringement, invalidity, co-inventorship, re-examination, opposition or similar claims with respect to any of our current trademarks, patents and copyrights, or any trademarks, patents or copyrights that we may
  seek to obtain in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brands, and substantially harm our business and results of operations. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us
  against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
In order to protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or to determine the enforceability, scope or validity of the intellectual or proprietary rights of others, we may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties, such as infringement suits, opposition
  proceedings or interference proceedings. Any lawsuits or proceedings that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Litigation and other proceedings also put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
  narrowly. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits or other proceedings that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material
  adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, many of our products bear, and the value of our brands is affected by, the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of our brand partners and licensors. Our brand partners’ and licensors’ ability to maintain and protect their trademark and other intellectual property rights is
  subject to risks similar to those described above with respect to our intellectual property. We do not control the protection of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of our brand partners and licensors and cannot ensure that our brand partners and licensors will be able to secure or protect
  their trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The loss of any of our significant owned or licensed trademarks, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property in any jurisdiction where we conduct a material portion of our business or where we plan geographic 
18



expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success depends on our ability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of other parties.
Our commercial success depends at least in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other proprietary rights of others. However, we cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not
  infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate such rights. Many companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage, and to the extent we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we may also face a greater risk of being the subject of
  such litigation. For these and other reasons, third parties may allege that our products, services or activities infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights. Defending against allegations and litigation could be expensive, take significant time, divert
  management’s attention from other business concerns, and delay getting our products to market. In addition, if we are found to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third party trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights, we may need to obtain a license, which may not be
  available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or redesign or rebrand our products, which may not be possible. We may also be required to pay substantial damages or be subject to a court order prohibiting us and our customers from selling certain products or engaging in certain activities. Our
  inability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of others could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our goodwill and other assets have been subject to impairment and may continue to be subject to impairment in the future.
We are required, at least annually, or as facts and circumstances warrant, to test goodwill and other assets to determine if impairment has occurred. Impairment may result from any number of factors, including adverse changes in assumptions used for valuation purposes, such as actual or projected
  net revenue growth rates, profitability or discount rates, or other variables. If the testing indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill
  or the fair value of other assets in the period the determination is made. We cannot always accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other assets become impaired, it would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
  operations. For example, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a $188.6 million asset impairment charge on the philosophy and TJoy trademarks due to lower than expected net revenues following their acquisition, as well as a related goodwill impairment charge of $384.4 million, each as described under Item 7,
  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Net Revenues—Operating Income—Adjusted Operating Income—Asset Impairment Charges.”
The purchase price of future acquisitions may not be representative of the operations acquired.
During the past several years, we have taken advantage of selected acquisition opportunities that we believed would complement our current product offerings, expand our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer operating efficiency
  opportunities and growth potential. Among other acquisitions in fiscal 2011, we acquired 100% of Philosophy’s stock for $929.7 million cash, and acquired 100% of TJoy via a stock purchase, for a total cash purchase price of $346.2 million. Each of these acquisitions resulted in impairment charges in
  fiscal 2012. For Philosophy, where the trademark impairment charge was $130.6 million in fiscal 2012, reductions in our projections were caused by lower than projected net revenues in the U.S. market, due to an innovation plan that was smaller in scope and less successful than expected, and a 
19



slowdown of brand sales momentum in certain key retailers. Furthermore, the expansion of the Philosophy business into certain international markets anticipated in fiscal 2012 was delayed due to a longer than expected product registration process in certain countries, contributing significantly to a
  reduction in current and long-term projected net revenues of the business and its resultant fair value. We also incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $384.4 million in fiscal 2012, resulting from the events described above impacting Philosophy projections, coupled with a delay in anticipated cost savings
  associated with consolidating the Philosophy business into our existing operations. For TJoy, where the trademark impairment charge was $58.0 million in fiscal 2012, our business performance was impacted by the departure of key employees, and the related transition to new leadership during our third
  quarter of fiscal 2012.
We are not aware of any other impairments at this time, and we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing such impairments, if any. We may experience subsequent impairment charges with respect to goodwill, intangible assets or other items, as we did in fiscal 2012. It is possible that future
  acquisitions may result in acquisition of additional goodwill and/or other intangible assets. Any such goodwill or assets acquired may become subject to impairment, which would reflect that the purchase price paid or owed with respect to such acquisitions is not representative of the operations or business
  acquired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A general economic downturn, the debt crisis and economic environment in Europe or a sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of our products, which could adversely affect our financial results.
The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs and consumer confidence, each of which is beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary
  periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. For example, in the 2008–09 economic downturn, our net revenues declined. Global events beyond our control may impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
The ongoing eurozone debt crisis has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, disruptions both in local economies and in global financial markets, particularly if it leads to any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults in the eurozone. Market disruptions in the eurozone
  could intensify or spread further, particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient. Concerns have been raised as to the financial, political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date. 
Continuing or worsening recessionary environments in Europe and elsewhere could affect the demand for our products and may result in longer sales cycles, slower acceptance of new products and increased competition for sales. Calendar year 2012 and 2013 sales in Europe in fragrances and
  categories of the color cosmetics industry have declined due to the economic slowdown, although our performance in the segments in which we compete have historically outperformed the industry. Deterioration of economic conditions in Europe or elsewhere could also impair collections on accounts
  receivable. In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes, can have a short-
  and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending. Events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling have impacted our travel retail business, and may continue to do so in the future. A downturn in the economies in which we sell our
  products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies where our travel retail business is located could adversely affect our net revenues and profitability.
If consumer purchases decrease, we may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to raise necessary 
20



funds. We cannot predict whether we would be able to undertake any of these actions to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms.
A sudden disruption in business conditions or a general economic downturn may affect the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
A decline in consumer purchases tends to impact our retailer customers. The financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also decide to assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer. Our inability to collect
  receivables from one of our largest customers that is a retailer, or from a group of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If a retailer were to go into liquidation, we could incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the
  retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
Volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.
While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions. Deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or
  more expensive. If any financial institutions that are parties to our credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign currency exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This
  could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or could leave us unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of certain items required by our operations, such
  as raw materials, transportation and freight, may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies in which their price or cost is quoted or analyzed. We hedge certain exposures to foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business in order to mitigate the effect of such
  fluctuations.
Our debt facilities require us to comply with specified financial covenants that may restrict our current and future operations and limit our flexibility and ability to respond to changes or take certain actions.
We remain dependent upon others for our financing needs, and our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. Our principal credit facility, which we refinanced on April 2, 2013, and the agreement governing our private placement of notes, which was amended on July 22, 2013, each contain
  covenants requiring us to maintain specific financial ratios and contain certain restrictions on us with respect to guarantees, liens, sales of certain assets, consolidations and mergers, affiliate transactions, indebtedness, dividends and other distributions and changes of control. There is a risk that these
  covenants could constrain execution of our business strategy and growth plans, including acquisitions. Should we decide to pursue an acquisition that requires financing that would result in a violation of our existing debt covenants, refusal of our current lenders to permit waivers or amendments to our
  existing covenants could delay or prevent consummation of our plans. This principal credit facility will expire in April 2018 and the notes are due in 2017, 2020 and 2022. There is no assurance that alternative financing or financing on as favorable terms will be found when these agreements expire.
We are subject to risks related to our international operations.
We operate on a global basis, and the majority of our fiscal 2013 net revenues was generated outside the United States. We maintain offices in over 30 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout
  the world. As of June 30, 2013, approximately 67% of our total net revenues, and approximately 27% of our long-lived assets were attributable to our foreign operations. Non-U.S. operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
21




  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations, reported earnings, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory
      and non-inventory items required by our operations;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    changes in foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on foreign investment, trade, import and export license requirements, quotas, trade barriers and other protection measures imposed by foreign countries, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in U.S. laws and regulations
      relating to foreign trade and investment;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    difficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcing remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including the FCPA, and different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    failure to effectively and immediately implement processes and policies across our diverse operations and employee base; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    adverse weather conditions, social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action or violent revolution.
    
  




We intend to reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax expenditures. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in
  higher effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. We cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass. If enacted, such legislation could have
  a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. Further, certain U.S. tax provisions are due to expire within the next year that, if not extended, could materially and adversely affect the tax positions of many U.S. multinationals, including ourselves.
Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States. As of June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, cash and cash equivalents in foreign operations included $914.2 million, $605.0 million and $505.0 million, or 99.3%, 99.2% and 98.9% of aggregate
  cash and cash equivalents, respectively.
We are also subject to the interpretation and enforcement by governmental agencies of other foreign laws, rules, regulations or policies, including any changes thereto, such as restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, and tariffs and taxes, which
  may require us to adjust our operations in certain markets where we do business. We face legal and regulatory risks in the United States and, in particular, cannot predict with certainty the outcome of various contingencies or the impact that pending or future legislative and regulatory changes may have
  on our business. It is not possible to gauge what any final regulation may provide, its effective date or its impact at this time. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in our operations. The main currencies to which we are exposed are the euro, the British pound, the Swiss franc, the Russian ruble, the Polish zloty, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The exchange rates between these
  currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from foreign operations reported in our consolidated financial
  statements and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. The cost of certain items, such as raw materials, transportation and freight, required by our operations may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. To the extent that we are
  required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, the appreciation of such 
22



currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Our failure to protect our reputation, or the failure of our partners to protect their reputations, could have a material adverse effect on our brand images.
Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our various brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity or if we, or the third parties with whom we do business, do not comply with regulations or accepted practices.
  Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, such as animal testing, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various
  adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, including applicable U.S. trade sanctions, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. See “—Our
  operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political, regulatory, economic and reputational risks” and “—We may incur penalties and experience other adverse effects on our business as a result of possible EAR violations.” We are also dependent on the reputations of our brand
  partners and licensors, which can be affected by matters outside of our control. Damage to our reputation or the reputations of our brand partners or licensors or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
  condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Our business is subject to seasonal variability.
Our sales generally increase during our second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. Accordingly, our financial performance, sales, working capital requirements, cash flow and borrowings generally experience variability during the three to six
  months preceding the holiday period. Any substantial decrease in net revenues, in particular during periods of increased sales due to seasonality, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We sell our products in a continually changing retail environment.
The retail industry, particularly in the United States and Europe, has continued to experience consolidation and other ownership changes, and the business environment for selling fragrances, color cosmetics, and skin & body care products may change further. During the last several years, significant
  consolidation has occurred. The trend toward consolidation, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Western Europe, has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers that control a higher percentage of retail locations, including large-format retailers and
  consolidated entities that own retail chains in both the mass and prestige distribution channels, which have increased their bargaining strength. Major retailers may, in the future, continue to consolidate, undergo restructuring or realign their affiliations, which could decrease the number of stores that sell
  our products or increase ownership concentration within the retail industry. Further business combinations among retailers may impede our growth and the implementation of our business strategy. In addition, the highly competitive U.S. discount and drug store environment has resulted in financial
  difficulties and store closings for a number of retailers, several of whom have liquidated or been acquired as a result. In addition, retailers, particularly in North America, have been reducing to a substantial extent their inventories of products, including our products. In fiscal 2013, no retailer accounted for
  more than 10% of our global net revenues; however, certain retailers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues within certain geographic markets, including the United States.
This trend towards consolidation has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers with respect to which we do not have long-term sales agreements or other contractual assurances as to future sales. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their 
23



purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason, which, in addition to a general deterioration of our customers’ business operations, could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our business.
As the retail industry changes, consumers may prefer to purchase their fragrances and cosmetics from other distribution channels than those we use, and we may not continue to be as successful in penetrating those channels as we currently are in other channels, or as successful as our competitors are.
  For example, we have not sold products through the direct sales channel in the markets where it is significant, and we are less experienced in e-commerce, direct response and door-to-door than in our more traditional distribution channels. Assuming e-commerce, direct response and door-to-door sales
  continue to grow worldwide, we will need to continue to develop related strategies in order to remain competitive. If we are not successful in the direct sales channel, we may experience lower than expected revenues or be required to recognize goodwill impairments, as we have recently done with respect
  to our Philosophy acquisition. See “—Our goodwill and other assets have been subject to impairment and may continue to be subject to impairment in the future.”
In addition, as we expand into new markets, other distribution channels that we do not utilize may be more significant. Although we have been able to recognize and adjust to many such changes in the retail industry to date, we can make no assurance as to our ability to make such adjustments in
  the future or the future effect of any such changes, including any potential material adverse effect such changes could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This concern is also valid with respect to new markets with which we are less familiar. See “—Our acquisition activities
  may present managerial, integration, operational and financial risks.” While many fragrance brands are distributed in either the prestige or mass-market, over the past several years “prestige” brands have become increasingly available in other outlets through unauthorized means. While we have taken
  actions and expended considerable resources to confront such “diversion” of our products and the unauthorized introduction of other prestige products into the mass-market sales channels, there can be no assurance that such actions will be successful or that “diversion” of our products will not have an
  adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
A disruption in operations could adversely affect our business.
As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key
  manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control. The loss of, or damage to, any of our manufacturing facilities or
  distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our decision to outsource certain functions means that we are dependent on the entities performing those functions.
As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. We
  have outsourced significant portions of our logistics management for our European prestige and mass businesses and our U.S. mass business, as well as certain technology-related functions, to third-party service providers. The dependence on a third party could lessen our control over deliveries to our
  customers. For example, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we transitioned to a new third-party logistics provider in Europe, which negatively impacted our sales. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with outsourcing entities, the failure of one or more
  such entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or provide them at the prices we expect, or the costs incurred in 
24



returning these outsourced functions to being performed under our management and direct control, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Third-party suppliers provide, among other things, the raw materials used to manufacture our products, and the loss of these suppliers, damage to our third-party suppliers’ reputations or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business.
We manufacture and package a majority of our products. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components, are purchased from various third-party suppliers. The loss of multiple suppliers or a significant disruption or interruption in the supply chain
  could have a material adverse effect on the manufacturing and packaging of our products. Increases in the costs of raw materials or other commodities may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost
  efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, failure by our third-party suppliers to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental laws, regulations or standards, or their engagement in politically or socially controversial conduct, such as animal testing, could negatively impact
  their reputations. Any of these failures or behaviors could lead to various adverse consequences, including damage to our reputation, decreased sales and consumer boycotts.
We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our information
  technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or
  shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer
  severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.
In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers or suppliers. In addition, the unauthorized disclosure of non-public
  sensitive information could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete.
Our success depends, in part, on our employees.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our employees, including our key personnel, such as our executive officers and senior management team and our research and development and marketing personnel. The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect
  our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense, and although our key personnel have signed non-compete agreements, it is possible that these agreements would be
  unenforceable in some jurisdictions, permitting employees in those jurisdictions to transfer their skills and knowledge to the benefit of our competitors with little or no restriction. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely
  affect our business.
25



Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
Product safety or quality failures, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, or inclusion of regulated ingredients could tarnish the image of our brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of contamination or other adverse
  effects on product safety or suitability for use by a particular consumer, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed. Such issues or recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image.
If our products are perceived to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales or become subject to liability claims.
  In addition, safety or other defects in our competitors’ products could reduce consumer demand for our own products if consumers view them to be similar. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage our inventories.
We currently engage in a program seeking to improve control over our inventories. This program has identified, and may continue to identify, inventories that are not saleable in the ordinary course, and that may have an adverse effect on our financial results. Moreover, there is no assurance that any
  inventory management program will be successful. If we misjudge consumer preferences or demands or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not
  successful in managing our inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business or products could adversely affect our financial results.
Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies. Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business or products, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, environmental
  or climate change laws, restrictions or requirements related to product content, labeling and packaging, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result, could adversely affect our financial
  results.
Our new product introductions may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.
We have a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, law and finance. Each new product launch, including those resulting from this new product
  development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      our advertising, promotional and marketing strategies for our new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    product purchases by our consumers may not be as high as we anticipate;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    we may experience out-of-stocks and/or product returns exceeding our expectations as a result of our new product launches or retailer space reconfigurations or our net revenues may be impacted by retailer inventory management or changes in retailer pricing or promotional strategies;
    
  


26






  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    we may incur costs exceeding our expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, advertising, promotional and marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    our product pricing strategies for new product launches may not be accepted by our retail customers or their consumers, which may result in our sales being less than anticipated.
    
  



The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.
Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which may be inferior or pose safety risks. Consumers could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could adversely
  affect our business. The presence of counterfeit versions of our products in the market could also dilute the value of our brands or otherwise have a negative impact on our reputation and business.
We believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. While we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our intellectual property and are aggressive in pursuing entities
  involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit products, we have not been able to prevent, and may in the future be unable to prevent, the imitation and counterfeiting of our products or the infringement of our trademarks. In particular, in recent years, there has been an increase in the availability of
  counterfeit goods, including fragrances, in various markets by street vendors and small retailers, as well as on the internet.
We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could affect our business or financial results.
We are subject to various foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to or imposing liability with respect to, among other things, the use, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes as well
  as the emission and discharge of such into the ground, air or water at our facilities or off-site, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. Certain environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination, without regard to fault, on current or previous
  owners or operators of real property and any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. We are currently involved in investigation or removal and/or remediation activities at certain sites. For
  example, prior to its acquisition by Coty, Del Labs sold its LaCross facility in Newark, New Jersey. The buyer gave Del Labs certain indemnities and agreed to remediate the property. Recently, Coty received a demand from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to complete the
  remediation of the property. We are currently in discussions with the NJDEP. While there can be no assurances as to remediation costs, we do not expect the remediation to result in material expenditures. Third parties may also make claims for personal injuries and property damage associated with
  releases of hazardous substances from these or other sites in the future.
Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent and, as a result, environmental liabilities, costs or expenditures could adversely affect our financial results or results of operations.
We are controlled by JAB Holdings II B.V. (“JAB”). Donata Holding SE (“Donata”), Parentes Holding SE (“Parentes”) and JAB Holdings B.V. As a result of their control of us, they have the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
As of September 16, 2013, we are controlled by JAB Holdings II B.V. (“JAB”). Donata Holding SE (“Donata”), Parentes Holding SE (“Parentes”) and JAB Holdings B.V. indirectly share voting and investment control over the shares held by JAB. JAB does not hold any of our Class A 
27



common stock, but holds 84.9% of both our outstanding Class B common stock and the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, JAB has the ability to
  exercise control over decisions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets, subject to JAB’s obligations under a stockholders agreement
  with other significant holders: affiliates of Berkshire Partners LLC (which affiliates we refer to as “Berkshire”) and affiliates of Rhône Capital L.L.C. (which affiliates we refer to as “Rhône”). JAB has the ability to make these decisions regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction
  is in our best interests. So long as JAB, or affiliates of JAB, continues to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of Class B common stock, even if they own significantly less than 50% of the shares of our outstanding common stock, they will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions,
  subject to JAB’s obligations under the stockholders agreement. In addition, pursuant to the stockholders agreement, Berkshire and Rhône each has the right to nominate a director to our Board of Directors, and each of the parties has agreed to vote for the other parties’ nominees. Berkshire and Rhône
  each hold this right so long as they continue to own at least 13,586,957 shares of either class of our common stock in the aggregate, respectively, adjusted for any stock split, dividend or combination, or any reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange or other similar reorganization. In
  addition, the Class B common stock held by Berkshire and Rhône may be transferred to an unrelated third party if the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock held by JAB and its affiliates have consented to that transfer in writing in advance.
The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company, could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of the Company and may ultimately affect the market
  price of our Class A common stock. JAB, Berkshire and Rhône are also in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete indirectly with us. JAB, Berkshire and Rhône or their respective affiliates may also pursue
  acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies”.
JAB, Donata, Parentes and JAB Holdings B.V. collectively own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the
  New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.
    
  




While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Audit and Finance Committee and Remuneration and Nomination Committee to have the otherwise required provisions, we are not requiring our Remuneration and Nomination
  Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors. As a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
