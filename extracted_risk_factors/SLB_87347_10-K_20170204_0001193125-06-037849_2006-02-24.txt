Item 1A    Risk Factors    We
urge you to carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Report. If any of the matters described below or elsewhere in this Report were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil or gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil
and gas industry and reduce our revenue.    Demand for the majority of our
oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and
generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including:  <FONT

·
 
oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;   


 
·
 
political and economic uncertainty and socio-political unrest;   


 
·
 
the level of worldwide oil exploration and production activity;   


 
·
 
the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;   


 
·
 
technological advances affecting energy consumption; and   


 
·
 
weather conditions.

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns,
which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could harm
our operating results.    A significant portion of our revenue is derived from
our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the more than 80 countries in which we operate.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 75% of our consolidated revenue in 2005 and 74% in both 2004 and 2003. Operations in countries other than the
United States are subject to various risks, including:   


 
·
 
unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas;   


 
·
 
exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions;   


 
·
 
social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;   


 
·
 
confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;   


 
·
 
deprivation of contract rights;   


 
·
 
trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries;  <FONT
SIZE="1"> 


 
·
 
restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;   


 
·
 
exchange controls;   


 
·
 
inflation; and   


 
·
 
currency fluctuations and devaluations.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%">In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Cuba, which are subject to
trade, economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States government.  The occurrence of any of the risks described above
could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water
discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly
expensive, complex and stringent. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for environmental damage without regard to
negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.  <FONT

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In
addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to
claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown
contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in
substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.    We could be
subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our results and financial condition.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such
as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product can cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately
protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or
policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to
substantial deductibles, could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have
been granted United States patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our
technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our
trade secrets.    We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that
we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.    The tools,
techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management
from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service, which would
reduce our revenue. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.

  Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations.
   We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical
services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our oilfield service businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified
individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.    <FONT FACE="ARIAL"
