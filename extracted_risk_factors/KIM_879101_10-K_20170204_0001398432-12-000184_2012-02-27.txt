Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company’s expectations will be realized.

PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is one of the nation's largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers.  The terms "Kimco," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" each refer to Kimco Realty Corporation and our subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") and has owned and operated neighborhood and community shopping centers for more than 50 years.  The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had interests in 946 shopping center properties (the “Combined Shopping Center Portfolio”), aggregating 138.1 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), and 845 other property interests, primarily through the Company’s preferred equity investments, other real estate investments and non-retail properties, totaling approximately 34.1 million square feet of GLA, for a grand total of 1,791 properties aggregating 172.2 million square feet of GLA, located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru. The Company’s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company’s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.  The Company believes its portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping center properties is the largest (measured by GLA) currently held by any publicly traded REIT.

The Company's executive offices are located at 3333 New Hyde Park Road, New Hyde Park, New York 11042-0020 and its telephone number is (516) 869-9000.  Nearly all operating functions, including leasing, legal, construction, data processing, maintenance, finance and accounting are administered by the Company from its executive offices in New Hyde Park, New York and supported by the Company’s regional offices.  As of December 31, 2011, a total of 685 persons are employed by the Company.

The Company’s Web site is located at http://www.kimcorealty.com.  The information contained on our Web site does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.  On the Company’s Web site you can obtain, free of charge, a copy of our Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable, after we file such material electronically with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.

The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders.  In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the "IPO") in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 


3


1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined under the Code.  In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland corporation.  In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations.  The Company's common stock, Class F Depositary Shares, Class G Depositary Shares and Class H Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”, “KIMprF”, “KIMprG” and “KIMprH”, respectively.

The Company’s initial growth resulted primarily from ground-up development and the construction of shopping centers.  Subsequently, the Company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation.  The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests.  The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees and promoted interests based on value creation.  The Company continued its geographic expansion with investments in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru.  The Company’s revenues and equity in income from its foreign investments are as follows (in millions):

The Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”), as permitted by the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, has been engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities, including (i) ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate management and disposition services, which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax-deferred exchange transactions.  The Company may consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise.

In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers.  The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets.  

Operating and Investment Strategy

The Company’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments in North America.  This vision will entail a shift away from non-retail assets that the Company currently holds. These investments include non-retail preferred equity investments, marketable securities, mortgages on non-retail properties and several urban mixed-use properties. The Company’s plan is to sell certain non-retail assets and investments. As of December 31, 2011, these investments had a book value of approximately $512 million, which represents less than 5.4% of the Company’s total assets. In addition, the Company continues to be committed to broadening its institutional management business by forming joint ventures with high quality domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers.

The Company's investment objective is to increase cash flow, current income and, consequently, the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth through (i) the retail re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of its existing centers and (ii) the selective acquisition of established income-producing real estate properties and properties requiring significant re-tenanting and redevelopment, primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the Company presently operates.  The Company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise.

The Company's neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and typically are anchored by a discount department store, a supermarket or a drugstore tenant offering day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.  The Company may either purchase or lease income-producing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership.  Equity

investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and/or other indebtedness.  Financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments.  Any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the Company’s equity interest in such property. The Company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate.

The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base.  As of December 31, 2011, no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 1.6% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 1.2% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA.  At December 31, 2011, the Company’s five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Wal-Mart, Sears Holdings and Kohl’s, which represented approximately 3.0%, 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, of the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.

As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts.  Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations.  Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following:

Loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code.  We believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT.  However, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations.  The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  New legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments.  

In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources, such as “rents from real property.” Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains.  Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes under the Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. The failure of a subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT.

If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because:

·
we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
·
we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; 
·
unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and
·
we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities. 



5


To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. While we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments.

Adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties.  

The economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including:

·
changes in the national, regional and local economic climate;
·
local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own;
·
trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes;
·
the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;
·
the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations;
·
tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; 
·
competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants;
·
changes in market rental rates;
·
the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space;
·
changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes;
·
the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and
·
changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes.

Competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties.

Our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. Our performance therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space.  In the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by:

·
weakness in the national, regional and local economies; 
·
the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; 


·
the impact of internet sales on the demand for reatil space;




·
ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; and
·
the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. 

In addition, numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. New regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers, or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. Retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. We may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent.

Our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. 



6


At any time our tenants’, particularly small local stores, may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases.  In the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases.

In addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease.  The occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance.

A tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so.  A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all.

We may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms.  

Real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code restricts a REIT’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. Therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition.  In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks.

These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential.  It is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management.  As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention.  In addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure.  We may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties.  Also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected.

We face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs.

We face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets.  Some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do.  This could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities.

We do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly.  In these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. These investments involve risks and uncertainties. The co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements.  The co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us.


7



Although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk.  Joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as:

·
potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner’s continued cooperation; 
·
our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree;
·
our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture;
·
our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources;
·
our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and
·
our joint venture partners’ business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments.

Our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above.

We intend to sell many of our non-retail assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us.  

There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-retail properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. Our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us.  

We have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business.  

The risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to:

·
currency risks, including currency fluctuations;
·
unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements;
·
potential adverse tax burdens;
·
burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws;
·
obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;
·
regional, national and local political uncertainty;
·
economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets;
·
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; 
·
difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and
·
reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries.

Each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

In order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. In addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. Our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. Since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations.

Our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions.



8


Our international operations are subject to a variety of United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, (“FCPA”). We cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions.

We cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our Code of Conduct or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, or other legal requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition.  

We cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms.  The inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as:

·
we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy;
·
our liquidity could be adversely affected;
·
we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness;
·
we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; or
·
we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities.

We are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities.

Our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions.  These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us.

Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities.

As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time.  Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following:

·
the extent of institutional investor interest in us;
·
the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to ours;
·
the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies;
·
our financial condition and performance;
·
the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends;
·
an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and
·
general economic and financial market conditions.

We may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future.

The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

We may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us.  

Our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us.  Marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. As a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of:

·
limited liquidity in the secondary trading market;
·
substantial market price volatility, resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates;
·
subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer;
·
the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and
·
the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. 

These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments.  

In the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations.  Delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns.  Furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. A decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans.

Our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. In these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely.  In these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. In the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected.

We may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations.

Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).  This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
