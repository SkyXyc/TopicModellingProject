Southwestern Energy
Company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and oil
exploration, development and production (E&P). We are also focused on
creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and
marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services.  

Exploration and
Production - Our primary business is the exploration for and production of
natural gas and oil, with our current operations being principally focused
within the United States on development of an unconventional gas reservoir
located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which we refer to as the
Fayetteville Shale play.  We are also actively engaged in exploration and
production activities in Pennsylvania, where we are targeting the unconventional
gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and to a lesser extent in Texas and
in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin.  We also engage in
exploration activities in order to test new plays and recently commenced
exploration operations in Arkansas and Louisiana relating to an unconventional
horizontal oil play targeting the Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation (LSBD).
 In addition, in 2010, we commenced an exploration program for natural gas
and crude oil under 32 licenses in New Brunswick, Canada.  We conduct our
exploration and production operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
SEECO, Inc., or SEECO, and Southwestern Energy Production Company, or SEPCO.
SEECO operates exclusively in Arkansas where it holds a large base of both
developed and undeveloped gas reserves, and conducts the Fayetteville Shale
drilling program and the conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program in the
Arkoma Basin. SEPCO conducts development drilling and exploration programs in
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.  DeSoto Drilling,
Inc., or DDI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEPCO, operates drilling rigs in
Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, as well as our other operating areas.
 Our Canadian operations are conducted by our subsidiary, SWN Resources
Canada Inc.  

Midstream Services
- We engage in natural gas gathering activities in Arkansas, Texas and
Pennsylvania through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company,
L.L.C., which we refer to as DeSoto Gathering, and Angelina Gathering Company,
L.L.C., which we refer to as Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering and Angelina
Gathering primarily support our E&P operations and generate revenue from
gathering fees associated with the transportation of our and third party gas to
market. Our natural gas marketing subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Services
Company, or SES, captures downstream opportunities which arise through the
marketing and transportation of the natural gas produced in our E&P
operations.  

The vast majority of our
operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion
and amortization, or EBITDA, is derived from our E&P business.  In
2011, 77% of our operating income and 84% of our EBITDA were generated from our
E&P business, compared to 81% of our operating income and 86% of our EBITDA
in 2010, and 86% of our operating income and 90% of our EBITDA in 2009, absent
our $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash ceiling test
impairment of our natural gas and oil properties.  In 2011, 23% of our
operating income and 16% of our EBITDA were generated from Midstream Services,
compared to 19% of our operating income and 14% of our EBITDA in 2010, and 14%
of our operating income and 10% of our EBITDA in 2009, absent the non-cash
ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties.  EBITDA is a
non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation
of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that
reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy.
  

Our Business
Strategy
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Our formula, which stands for “The Right People doing the Right
Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create
Value+,” also guides our business strategy.  We are focused on providing
long-term growth in the net asset value of our business.  In our E&P
business, we prepare an economic analysis for each investment opportunity based
upon the expected present value added for each dollar to be invested, which we
refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI.  The PVI of the future expected
cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate.  We
target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre-tax PVI for each dollar we
invest in our E&P projects.  Our actual PVI results are utilized to
help determine the allocation of our future capital investments.  The key
elements of our business strategy are:

the Marcellus Shale.  Our primary focus is to maximize the value of our
significant acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play, which has provided
significant production and reserve growth since we began drilling in the play in
2004. At December 31, 2011, we held approximately 925,842 net acres in the
Fayetteville Shale play and the area accounted for approximately 87% of our
total proved oil and natural gas reserves and approximately 87% of our total oil
and natural gas production during 2011.  Additionally, we are actively
drilling on portions of our 186,893 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and believe
our production and reserves from this play will grow substantially over the next
few years.  We intend to further develop our acreage positions in the
Fayetteville Shale and the Marcellus Shale and improve our well results through
the use of advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of our
properties.

Focusing on Emerging Unconventional Plays.  We actively seek to find
and develop new oil and natural gas plays with significant exploration and
exploitation potential, which we refer to as “New Ventures.” Our New Ventures
prospects are evaluated based on repeatability, multi-well potential and land
availability as well as other criteria, and can be located both inside and
outside of the United States.  As of December 31, 2011, we held 3,600,314
net undeveloped acres in connection with our New Ventures prospects, including
2,518,518 net acres in New Brunswick and 520,619 net undeveloped acres in the
LSBD formation in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana.

of Scale.  In our key operating areas, the concentration of our
properties allows us to achieve economies of scale that result in lower
costs.  We seek to serve as the operator of the wells in which we have
a significant interest. As the operator, we are better positioned to control the
enhancing, drilling, completing and producing of wells and the marketing of
production to minimize costs and maximize both production volumes and realized
price.  In our Fayetteville Shale play, we have achieved significant cost
savings by operating a fleet of drilling rigs designed specifically for the play
and from our other associated oilfield services including our sand mine that is
a source of proppant for our well completions.  During 2012, we plan
to commence providing pressure pumping services for certain of our operated well
completions.

 We have continued to design and improve our gas gathering
infrastructure to better manage the physical movement of our production and the
costs of our operations.  As of December 31, 2011, we have invested
approximately $933.0 million in the 1,791 mile gas gathering system built for
our Fayetteville Shale play, which was gathering approximately 2.1 Bcf per day
at year-end, and have invested approximately $44.2 million in 38 miles of gas
gathering lines in East Texas and Pennsylvania.  Our gathering system for
the Fayetteville Shale play has developed into a strategic asset that not only
supports our E&P operations but also will increase our overall returns on a
standalone basis.
Recent Developments
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>2012 Planned Capital Investments and Production Guidance.
 Our planned capital investment program for 2012 is approximately $2.1
billion, which includes approximately $1.8 billion for our E&P segment, $190
million for our Midstream Services segment and $90 million for corporate and
other purposes.  Our 2012 capital program is expected to be primarily
funded by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our $1.5 billion
revolving credit facility.  The planned capital program for 2012 is
flexible and we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into
account prevailing market conditions. Based on our capital program, we also
announced our targeted 2012 natural gas and oil production of approximately 560
to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 13% over our 2011 production, using
midpoints.

Production
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"
align=justify>Overview
Our operations are
primarily focused on the Fayetteville Shale, an unconventional reservoir located
in the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas.  In addition to our Arkansas operations,
we are also continuing to expand our drilling program on our acreage in
Pennsylvania targeting the Marcellus Shale and we will conduct both conventional
and unconventional operations targeting various formations as part of our New
Ventures projects, which include the recently announced unconventional
horizontal oil plays targeting the Brown Dense formation in Arkansas and
Louisiana, and exploration activities in New Brunswick, Canada.  We
continue to actively seek to develop both conventional and unconventional
natural gas and oil resource plays with significant exploration and exploitation
potential.

Our E&P segment
recorded operating income of $825.1 million in 2011. Our E&P segment
recorded operating income of $829.5 million in 2010 and an operating loss of
$157.7 million in 2009 as a result of the recognition of a $907.8 million, or
$558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas
and oil properties recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2009.  The
slight decrease in operating income in 2011 was primarily due to lower prices
realized from the sale of our natural gas production and an increase in
operating costs and expenses which was largely offset by a 24% increase in our
total natural gas and oil production. The increase in operating income in 2010
was primarily due to a 35% increase in our total natural gas and oil production
which was partially offset by lower prices realized from the sale of our natural
gas production and an increase in operating costs and expenses. EBITDA from
our E&P segment was $1.5 billion in 2011, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010
and $1.2 billion in 2009. The increase in our EBITDA in 2011 was due to our
increased production volumes which was partially offset by lower prices realized
from the sale of our natural gas production and increased operating costs and
expenses.  The increase in our EBITDA in 2010 was due to our increased
production volumes which was partially offset by lower prices realized from the
sale of our natural gas production and increased operating costs and expenses.
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Business — Other Items —
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy. 

Our Proved Reserves

Our estimated proved
natural gas and oil reserves were 5,893 Bcfe at year-end 2011, compared to 4,937
Bcfe at year-end 2010 and 3,657 Bcfe at year-end 2009. The overall increase
in total estimated proved reserves in the past three years is primarily due to
the development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas, with the development
of the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania also contributing in 2011.  The
average prices utilized to value our estimated proved natural gas and oil
reserves at December 31, 2011 were $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $92.71
per barrel for oil compared to $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $75.96 per
barrel for oil at December 31, 2010 and $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas and
$57.65 per barrel for oil at December 31, 2009. 

The after-tax PV-10, or
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas
and oil reserve quantities, was $3.5 billion at year-end 2011, compared to $3.0
billion at year-end 2010 and $1.8 billion at year-end 2009.  The
increase in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2011 was primarily due to the increase
in our reserves, partially offset by a comparative decrease in average 2011
prices for natural gas from average 2010 prices. The increase in our after-tax
PV-10 value in 2010 was primarily due to the increase in our reserves and a
comparative increase in average 2010 prices for natural gas from average 2009
prices, partially offset by higher operating and future development costs.
 Our proved reserves are almost entirely natural gas and as such the
after-tax PV-10 measure is highly dependent upon the natural gas price used in
the after-tax PV-10 calculation. The reconciling difference in after-tax PV-10
and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2011 Proved
Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted
value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our year-end
2011 estimated proved reserves had a present value of estimated future net cash
flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $4.8 billion, compared to $4.3
billion at year-end 2010 and $2.3 billion at year-end 2009.  

We believe that the
pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved
reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value.
 While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that
are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the
unique tax situation of each individual company.  We understand that
securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s
current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies
without regard to income taxes.  We refer you to Note 4 in the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure
of discounted future cash flows related to our proved gas and oil reserves, to
the risk factor “Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is
independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate” in Item
1A of Part I of this Form 10-K, and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about
Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and
estimated reserve data.

Approximately 100% of
our year-end 2011 and 2010 estimated proved reserves were natural gas and
55% were classified as proved developed, compared to 100% and 54%, respectively,
in 2009.  We operate approximately 96% of our reserves, based on the
pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve
life index approximated 11.8 years at year-end 2011.  Sales of natural
gas production accounted for nearly 100% of total operating revenues for this
segment in 2011, 99% in 2010 and 100% in 2009.
 
The following table
provides an overall and by category summary of our oil and natural gas reserves,
as of fiscal year-end 2011 based on average fiscal year prices, and our well
count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2011 and sets forth 2011 annual
information related to production and capital investments for each of our
operating areas:

align=justify>As of December 31, 2011, we had 2,633 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserves, none of which were proved undeveloped reserves that remain undeveloped
for five years or more after initially being disclosed by us.  During 2011,
we invested $509.3 million in connection with converting 403.3 Bcfe or 18% of
our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2010 into proved developed
reserves and added 847.8 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions, primarily
in the Fayetteville Shale play. Our 2011 proved undeveloped reserve additions
are expected to be developed and to begin to generate cash inflows over the next
five years.  At December 31, 2010, we had 2,243 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserves, none of which were proved undeveloped reserves that remained
undeveloped for five years or more after initially being disclosed by us.
 During 2010, we invested $312.4 million in connection with converting
213.1 Bcfe or 13% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009
into proved developed reserves and added 733.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserve additions, primarily in the Fayetteville Shale play. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The development of our proved undeveloped reserves will require us
to make significant additional investments.  We expect that the development
costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 2,633 Bcfe as of December 31, 2011
will require us to invest an additional $3.4 billion in order for those reserves
to be brought to production.  Our ability to make the necessary investments
to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our
control.  A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period of
time could result in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce,
leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows.  We refer you to the
risk factors “A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices
would have a material adverse affect on us,” “We may have difficulty financing
our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth” and

Our Reserve Replacement

The ability of an
E&P company to add new reserves to replace the reserves that are being
depleted by its current production volumes is viewed by many investors as an
indication of its long-term prospects.  The reserve replacement ratio,
which we discuss below, is an important analytical measure used within the
E&P industry by investors and peers to evaluate performance results.
 There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure as it does not
reflect the type of reserves or the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the
potential value of the reserve additions.  Our reserve replacement ratio,
including revisions, has averaged over 400% for the three year period ended
December 31, 2011, primarily driven by increases in the reserves associated with
our Fayetteville Shale play with the development of the Marcellus Shale play in
Pennsylvania also contributing in 2011. 

In 2011, we replaced
299% of our production volumes with an increase of 1,459.4 Bcfe of proved gas
and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward revisions of
33.7 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 611.6 Bcfe were proved developed and
847.8 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve revisions during 2011
were primarily due to 102.6 Bcf in upward revisions related to the improved
performance of wells in our Marcellus Shale play, partially offset by downward
performance revisions of 27.5 Bcfe and 18.2 Bcfe in our east Texas and
conventional Arkoma Basin operating areas, respectively.  We also had
downward performance revisions in our Fayetteville Shale play of 14.0 Bcfe.
 Additionally, our reserves decreased by 9.2 Bcfe due to a comparative
decrease in the average gas price for 2011 as compared to 2010.  In
addition, our reserves decreased by 37.3 Bcfe as a result of our sale of oil and
natural gas leases and wells in 2011.

Table of Contents

In 2010, we replaced
430% of our production volumes with an increase of 1,431.1 Bcfe of proved gas
and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward revisions of
309.6 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 698.0 Bcfe were proved developed and
733.2 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve revisions during 2010
were primarily due to 266.7 Bcf in upward revisions related to the improved
performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play and positive reserve
revisions of 78.4 Bcfe due to a comparative increase in the average gas price
for 2010 as compared to 2009.  Additionally, we had net upward revisions of
2.7 Bcfe and 34.2 Bcf in our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin operating
areas, respectively.  Additionally, our reserves decreased by 55.4 Bcfe as
a result of our sale of oil and natural gas leases and wells in 2010.

In 2009, our reserve
replacement ratio was 592% with an increase of 1,685.2 Bcfe of proved natural
gas and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward
revisions of 92.9 Bcfe.  Of the 2009 reserve additions, 757.6 Bcfe were
proved developed and 927.5 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve
revisions during 2009 were primarily due to 384.8 Bcf in upward revisions
related to the improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play,
partially offset by downward reserve revisions of 251.5 Bcf due to a comparative
decrease in the average gas price for 2009 as compared to year-end 2008.
 Additionally, we had downward performance revisions of 25.5 Bcfe and 15.1
Bcf in our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin operating areas,
respectively.

For the period ending
December 31, 2011, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio,
including revisions, was 416%. Our reserve replacement ratio for 2011, excluding
the effect of reserve revisions, was 292%, compared to 354% in 2010 and 561% in
2009. Excluding reserve revisions, our three-year average reserve replacement
ratio is 380%.

Since 2005, the
substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our
drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play.  We expect our drilling
programs in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays to continue be the
primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to
add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control.  We
refer you to the risk factors “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale and
Marcellus Shale plays are subject to change” and “Our exploration, development
and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may not be profitable or
achieve our targeted returns” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K and to

Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of
Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these factors and

Our Operations

Fayetteville Shale Play

Our Fayetteville Shale
play is currently a primary focus of our E&P business. The Fayetteville
Shale is a Mississippian-age unconventional gas reservoir located on the
Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in thickness from 50 to 550 feet and
ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet.  The Barnett Shale found in
north Texas is an analogous reservoir.  At December 31, 2011, we held
leases for approximately 925,842 net acres in the play area (360,473 net
undeveloped acres, 440,313 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale
production, 123,442 net developed acres held by conventional production and the
remainder in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin), compared to
approximately 915,884 net acres at year-end 2010 and 888,695 net acres at
year-end 2009. 

Approximately 5,104 Bcf
of our reserves at year-end 2011 were attributable to our Fayetteville Shale
play, compared to approximately 4,345 Bcf at year-end 2010 and 3,117 Bcf at
year-end 2009.  Gross production from our operated wells in the
Fayetteville Shale play increased from approximately 1,635 MMcf per day at the
beginning of 2011 to approximately 1,947 MMcf per day by year-end.  Our net
production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 436.8 Bcf in 2011, compared to
350.2 Bcf in 2010 and 243.5 Bcf in 2009. In 2012, we estimate our production
from the Fayetteville Shale play will be in the range of 465 to 470 Bcf.

At year-end
2011, approximately 74% of our 597,482 total net leasehold acres in the
Fayetteville Shale was held by production, excluding our acreage in the
traditional Fairway and the federal acreage we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit.
 For more information about our acreage and well count, we refer you to
“Properties” in Item 2 of Part 1 of this Form 10-K.   Excluding our
acreage in the traditional Fairway, our acreage position was obtained at an
average cost of approximately $253 per acre and has an average royalty interest
of 15%.  In 2012, we will earn 2 sections or approximately 500
net acres, representing less than 1% of our drilling program.
  As of December 31, 2011, excluding our acreage in the traditional
Fairway and our federal acreage, the undeveloped portion of our acreage had an
average remaining lease term of 2 years.

 We refer you to the risk
factor “If we fail to drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our
acreage, the initial lease terms could expire, which would result in the loss of
certain leasehold rights” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.  
As of December 31, 2011,
we had spud a total of 3,095 wells in the play since its commencement in 2004,
2,581 of which were operated by us and 514 of which were outside-operated wells.
 Of the wells spud, 650 were in 2011, 658 were in 2010 and 570 were in
2009.  Of the wells spud in 2011, 649 were designated as horizontal wells.
 At year-end 2011, 2,380 operated wells had been drilled and completed
overall, including 2,290 horizontal wells.  Of the 2,290 horizontal wells,
2,272 wells were fracture stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel
stimulation treatments, or a combination thereof.

Over the past several
years, we have seen continual improvement in our drilling practices in the
Fayetteville Shale play.  Our operated horizontal wells had an average
completed well cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length
of 4,836 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 8 days from re-entry
to re-entry in 2011.  This compares to an average completed operated well
cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,528 feet
and average time to drill to total depth of 11 days from re-entry to re-entry
during 2010.  In 2009, our average completed operated well cost was $2.9
million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,100 feet and
average time to drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry.
 The operated wells we placed on production during 2011 averaged initial
production rates of 3,330 Mcf per day, compared to average initial production
rates of 3,364 Mcf per day in 2010 and 3,478 Mcf per day in
2009.  The decrease in initial production rates in 2011 and 2010 are
primarily due to increased well density and locational differences in the mix of
wells.  During 2011, we placed 51 operated wells on production with initial
production rates that exceeded 5.0 MMcf per day, including 6 wells that exceeded
6.0 MMcf per day.

Beginning in late 2008
and continuing through 2011, we drilled a significant number of wells to test
tighter well spacing. At December 31, 2011, we had placed 1,123 wells on
production that have well spacing of 700 feet or less, representing
approximately 65-acre spacing or less. Early production performance from recent
well spacing tests suggests that there are areas of the field that may be
economically developed at tighter spacing depending on market conditions.

Our total proved net
reserves booked in the play at year-end 2011 were from a total of 4,376
locations, of which 2,735 were proved developed producing, 59 were proved
developed non-producing and 1,582 were proved undeveloped.  Of the 4,376
locations, 4,310 were horizontal. The average gross proved reserves for the
undeveloped wells included in our year-end 2011 and 2010 reserves was
approximately 2.4 Bcf per well, compared to 2.2 Bcf per well at year-end 2009.
 Total proved net gas reserves booked in the play in 2010 totaled
approximately 4,345 Bcf from a total of 3,682 locations, of which 2,120 were
proved developed producing, 36 were proved developed non-producing and 1,526
were proved undeveloped.  Total proved net gas reserves booked in the play
in 2009 totaled approximately 3,117 Bcf from a total of 2,675 locations, of
which 1,428 were proved developed producing, 97 were proved developed
non-producing and 1,150 were proved undeveloped.  If the Fayetteville Shale
play continues to be successfully developed, we expect a continued significant
level of proved reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play over the next few
years.

In 2011, we invested
approximately $1.3 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included
approximately $1.2 billion to spud 650 wells, 580 of which we operated.  We
increased our reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play by 1,196 Bcf, which
included net downward reserve revisions of 15 Bcf due primarily to well
performance of 14 Bcf and downward price revisions of 1 Bcf.  Included in
our total capital investments in the play during 2011 was $132 million in
capitalized costs and other expenses and $10 million for acquisition of
properties.  In 2010, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which included $1.2 billion to spud 658 wells, $48
million for acquisition of properties, and $111 million in capitalized costs and
other expenses.  In 2009, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which included $1.1 billion to spud 570 wells, $40
million for acquisition of properties, $22 million for seismic and $106 million
in capitalized costs and other expenses.  At December 31, 2011, we had
acquired approximately 1,324 square miles of 3-D seismic data, which provides us
with seismic data on approximately 65% of our net acreage position in the
Fayetteville Shale, excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway portion of
the Arkoma Basin.

In 2012, we plan to
invest approximately $1.1 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which includes
participating in approximately 460 to 470 gross wells, 425 to 435 of which are
planned to be operated by us.  

We believe that our
Fayetteville Shale acreage continues to have significant development potential.
 Our strategy going forward is to increase our production through
development drilling, increase the amount of acreage we hold by production and
determine the economic viability of the undrilled portion of our acreage.
 Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play is
flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of
our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and
economic fracture stimulation methods and well spacing, the extent to which we
can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells in
other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas commodity price
environment.  As we continue to gather data about the

Fayetteville Shale, it is possible that
additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine
that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at
all. We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling plans are subject to change”
in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Marcellus Shale Play

We began leasing in
northeastern Pennsylvania in 2007 in an effort to gain a position in the
emerging Marcellus Shale play.  At December 31, 2011, we had approximately
186,893 net acres in Pennsylvania under which we believe the Marcellus Shale is
prospective (180,676 net undeveloped acres and 6,217 net developed acres held by
production), compared to approximately 173,009 net acres at year-end of 2010 and
149,317 net acres at year-end 2009.  The increase in our acreage during
2011 and 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of additional leasehold.
 Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2011 had an average
remaining lease term of 2 years, an average royalty interest of 13% and was
obtained at an average cost of approximately $1,077 per acre.  

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>As of year-end 2011, we had spud 70 wells, 23 of which were on
production and 67 of which were horizontal wells.  In 2011, we invested
approximately $332 million in the Marcellus Shale, which included approximately
$214 million to participate in 45 wells, of which 8 are on production and 37
were in progress at year-end.  Of these 45 wells, 18 were horizontal wells
located in our Greenzweig area in Bradford County and the remaining 27 wells
were located in our Price and Range Trust areas in Susquehanna
County.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had 22 operated
horizontal wells on production which had an average completed well cost of $6.4
million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,007 feet and an average
of 12 fracture stimulation stages.  Included in our total capital
investments in the play during 2011 was approximately $77 million for
acquisition of properties, $13 million for seismic and $29 million in
capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2011, we began the year drilling
with one operated rig in Pennsylvania and ended the year with two operated
rigs.
Approximately 342 Bcf of
our total proved net reserves at year-end 2011 were attributable to the
Marcellus Shale.  The company had a total of 22 operated horizontal wells
and 1 operated vertical well which were on production at December 31, 2011,
resulting in net production from this area of 23.4 Bcf in 2011, compared to 1.0
Bcf in 2010.  Our reserves booked
in the Marcellus Shale included a total of 60 locations, of which 30 were proved
developed producing, 2 were proved developed non-producing and 28 were proved
undeveloped.  The average gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells
included in our year-end reserves was approximately 7.5 Bcf per well, up from
3.0 per well at year-end 2010.  In 2010, we invested approximately $118
million in the Marcellus Shale and participated in 21 wells, resulting in net
production of 1.0 Bcf and adding new reserves of 38 Bcf. In 2009, we invested
approximately $40 million in the Marcellus Shale, substantially all of which was
for the acquisition of properties. 
 
In 2012, we plan to
invest approximately $526 million.  We expect to end the year with four
operated rigs and participate in a total of 80 to 85 gross wells in 2012, all of
which will be operated by us. In 2012, we estimate our production from the
Marcellus Shale play will be in the range of 60 to 65 Bcf.  Our
ability to bring our Marcellus Shale production to market will depend on a
number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of
capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.  We refer
you to “Midstream Services — Gas Marketing” for a discussion of our gathering
and transportation arrangements for the Marcellus Shale production and to the
risk factor “Our ability to sell our natural gas and oil and/or to receive
market prices for our production may be adversely affected by constraints or
interruptions on gathering systems, pipelines, processing and transportation
systems owned or operated by us or others.” in Item 1A of Part I of this
Form 10-K.  

We believe that our
Marcellus Shale acreage has significant development potential. Our drilling
program with respect to our Marcellus Shale play is flexible and will be

Ark-La-Tex 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Our Ark-La-Tex division includes our conventional assets in the
Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma and our conventional and unconventional
assets in East Texas.  Production from these assets was 39.8 Bcfe in 2011,
compared to 53.5 Bcfe in 2010 and 56.9 Bcfe in 2009.  The decline in
production from these areas during 2011 and 2010 was primarily driven by asset
dispositions as well as natural field production declines and lower capital
investments in these areas since

2009.  In May
2011, we sold the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale
intervals in approximately 9,717 net acres for approximately $118.1 million.
 In June 2010, we sold the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle
Bossier Shale intervals in approximately 20,063 net acres for approximately
$357.8 million.  We expect these sales, together with our planned decrease
in capital investments and the natural production decline in existing wells, to
decrease our net production from East Texas in 2012.  In 2011, we invested
approximately $76 million in East Texas and Arkoma and participated in 10 wells,
adding new reserves of 19 Bcfe.  Total proved net reserves from these areas
were approximately 447 Bcfe at December 31, 2011, compared to 554 Bcfe at
year-end 2010 and 538 Bcfe at year-end 2009.  In 2012, we expect to invest
approximately $18 million combined in our East Texas and Conventional Arkoma
Basin programs.
New Ventures
We actively seek to find
and develop new oil and natural gas plays with significant exploration and
exploitation potential, which we refer to as “New Ventures.” We have been
focusing on both oil and gas unconventional plays, and the technological methods
best suited to developing these plays, such as horizontal drilling and fracture
stimulation techniques. New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on
repeatability, multi-well potential and land availability as well as other
criteria and may be located both inside and outside of the United States. As of
December 31, 2011, we held 3,600,314 net undeveloped acres in connection with
our New Ventures prospects, of which 2,518,518 net acres were located in New
Brunswick, Canada and 520,619 net acres related to the Lower Smackover Brown
Dense (LSBD) in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. This compares to
3,009,643 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2010, of which 2,518,518 net
acres were located in New Brunswick, Canada, and 36,125 net undeveloped acres
held at year-end 2009.

In 2010, we successfully
bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of the
Province of New Brunswick, Canada to search and conduct an exploration program
covering over 2,518,518 net acres in the province in order to test new
hydrocarbon basins. As a condition under our licenses, we are required to make
investments of approximately $47 million USD in the province by March 31, 2013.
During 2011 and 2010, we conducted airborne gravity and magnetics surveys,
surface geochemistry surveys and, as of December 31, 2011, had acquired 248
miles of 2-D seismic data. While preliminary interpretation has already begun,
in 2012 we intend to continue our acquisition of approximately 130 additional
miles of 2-D seismic data and plan to drill two stratigraphic well tests in the
fourth quarter of 2012. Through December 31, 2011, we have invested
approximately $24.0 million in our New Brunswick exploration program, which
represents our first venture outside of the United States.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In July 2011, we announced that we would begin testing a new
unconventional horizontal oil play targeting the LSBD formation, an
unconventional oil reservoir that ranges in vertical depths from 8,000 to 11,000
feet and appears to be laterally extensive over a large area ranging in
thickness from 300 to 550 feet. At December 31, 2011, we held approximately
520,619 net undeveloped acres in the area, obtained at an average cost of $375
per acre.  Our leases currently have an 82% average net revenue interest
and an average primary lease term of 4 years, which may be extended for an
additional 4 years. The LSBD formation is an Upper Jurassic age, kerogen-rich
carbonate source rock found across the Gulf Coast region of the southern United
States from Texas to Florida. We extensively reviewed the LSBD across the region
and believe that the right mix of reservoir depth, thickness, porosity, matrix
permeability, sealing formations, thermal maturity and oil characteristics are
found in our leased areas and that the formation compares favorably to other
productive oil plays in the United States. In February 2012, we completed our
first well in the play area, the Roberson 18-19 #1-15H located in Columbia
County, Arkansas, at a total depth of approximately 9,369 feet and a horizontal
lateral length of approximately 3,600 feet. Our second well, the Garrett
7-23-5H #1 located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, was drilled to a vertical
depth in February 2012 at approximately 10,863 feet with a 6,536-foot horizontal
lateral and is expected to be completed in March 2012.  If our drilling

increase significantly over the next several years.

Sales, Delivery Commitments
and Customers
Sales. Our daily
natural gas equivalent production averaged 1,370.0 MMcfe in 2011, compared to
1,108.8 MMcfe in 2010 and 823.1 MMcfe in 2009.  Total natural gas
equivalent production was 500.0 Bcfe in 2011, up from 404.7 Bcfe in 2010 and
300.4 Bcfe in 2009.  Our natural gas production was 499.4 Bcf in 2011,
compared to 403.6 Bcf in 2010 and 299.7 Bcf in 2009.  The increase in
production in 2011 resulted primarily from a 86.6 Bcf increase in net production
from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4 Bcf increase in net production from
our Marcellus Shale play, which more than offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease
in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties.  The
increase in

production in 2010 resulted primarily from
a 106.7 Bcf increase in production from the Fayetteville Shale play and an
increase in our East Texas production, which more than offset a combined 3.4
Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties.
 We also produced 97,000 barrels of oil in 2011, compared to 171,000
barrels of oil in 2010 and 124,000 barrels of oil in 2009.  Our oil
production has decreased between 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the natural
production decline in existing wells.  For 2012, we are targeting total
natural gas and crude oil production of approximately 560 to 570 Bcfe, which
represents a growth rate of approximately 13% over our 2011 production volumes,
using midpoints.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Sales of natural gas and oil production are conducted under
contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings.
We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas,
including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for
our production.  We periodically enter into various hedging and other
financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas
and crude oil production in order to support certain desired levels of cash flow
and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit
speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with
appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2011, we had NYMEX commodity price
hedges in place on 266.4 Bcf, or approximately 47% of our targeted 2012 natural
gas production and 185.2 Bcf of our expected 2013 natural gas production.
 We intend to hedge additional future production volumes to the extent
natural gas prices rise to levels that we believe will achieve certain desired
levels of cash flow.  We refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10-K,
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,” for further
information regarding our hedge position at December 31, 2011.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Including the effect of hedges, we realized an average wellhead
price of $4.19 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2011, compared to $4.64
per Mcf in 2010 and $5.30 per Mcf in 2009.  Our hedging activities
increased our average gas price $0.63 per Mcf in 2011, increased our average gas
price $0.71 per Mcf in 2010 and increased our average price $1.96 per Mcf in
2009.  Our average oil price realized was $94.08 per barrel in 2011,
compared to $76.84 per barrel in 2010 and $54.99 per barrel in 2009.  None
of our crude oil production was hedged during 2011, 2010 or 2009.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>During 2011, the average price received for our natural gas
production, excluding the impact of hedges, was approximately $0.48 Mcf lower
than average NYMEX prices.  Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2012 of
$3.00 per Mcf of natural gas, the average price received for our natural gas
production is expected to be approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per Mcf below the
NYMEX Henry Hub average settlement price, including the impact of our basis
hedges. Our E&P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a
discount to NYMEX settlement prices due to locational basis differentials, while
transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received.  In
2012, we expect to pay average third-party transportation charges in the range
of $0.25 to $0.30 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the range of 0.50% to
1.00% of our sales price for natural gas. In 2012, we expect to receive an
average natural gas sales price of approximately $0.45 to $0.55 less than the
average NYMEX settlement price.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Delivery Commitments. As of February 1, 2012, we had
natural gas delivery commitments of 228 Bcf in 2012 and 41 Bcf in 2013 under
existing agreements.  These commitments require the delivery of natural gas
in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Texas.   These amounts are well below
our forecasted 2012 and anticipated 2013 production from our available reserves
in our Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale and East Texas operations, which are
not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities
delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations
imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our
control that may affect our ability to meet our contractual obligations other
than those discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”  We expect to be able to
fulfill all of our short-term or long-term contractual obligations to provide
natural gas from our own production of available reserves, however, if we are
unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our
obligations. 
Customers. Our
customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial consumers of
natural gas. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no single
third-party customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.

Impact of
Federal Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas and Oil
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has
been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC.  In 1989, Congress
enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act.  The
Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting
wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers
of natural gas can be made at uncontrolled market prices.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"

and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and
judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the
natural gas industry.

There can be no
assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the
FERC and Congress will continue. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental
Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with
government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental
protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on
our business.
Competition
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>All phases of the oil and natural gas industry are highly
competitive.  We compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for
and development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil and
the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.
 Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other
independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and
operators.  Many of these competitors have financial and other resources
that substantially exceed those available to us. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Competition in Arkansas has increased in recent years due largely
to the development of improved access to interstate pipelines and our discovery
of the Fayetteville Shale play. While improved intrastate and interstate
pipeline transportation in Arkansas should increase our access to markets for
our natural gas production, these markets will also be served by a number of
other suppliers.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may
affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. Outside
Arkansas, we are less established and face competition from a larger number of
other producers.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Commencing in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders
(collectively, “Order No. 636”), which require interstate pipelines to provide
transportation separately, or “unbundled,” from the pipelines’ sales of natural
gas.  Order No. 636 also requires pipelines to provide open-access
transportation on a basis that is equal for all shippers.  Although Order
No. 636 does not directly regulate our activities, the FERC has stated that it
intends for Order No. 636 to foster increased competition within all phases of
the natural gas industry.  Starting in 2000, the FERC issued a series of
orders (collectively, “Order No. 637”), which imposed a number of additional
reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  Among
other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period, and effected
changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity
segmentation, pipeline penalties, rights of first refusal and information
reporting.  The implementation of these orders has not had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations to date. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms
initiated by the FERC or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of
increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing
transparency in markets in which our natural gas is sold.  However, we do
not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other
natural gas producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other
legislative body. 
Regulation of
Hydraulic Fracturing
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operations as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  It is an essential and
common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil,
natural gas, and associated liquids from dense subsurface rock formations. The
knowledge and expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our
operations in the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other
operating areas, currently including our Marcellus Shale acreage and, in the
near future, expected to include our exploration programs in New Brunswick,
Canada. Successful hydraulic fracturing techniques are also expected to be
critical to the development of our recently announced unconventional horizontal
oil play targeting the LSBD formation in Arkansas and Louisiana.  Hydraulic
fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the
hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the
wellbore. In our Fayetteville Shale play, the fracturing fluids we use are
comprised of over 99.9% water and sand. The remaining 0.1% is comprised
of small quantities of additives which contain chemical compounds such
as hydrochloric acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde and sodium chloride which is
used in common household products. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In the past few years, there has
been an increased focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing
practices in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas
commissions but there have recently been a number of regulatory initiatives at
the federal and local levels as well as by other state agencies<FONT
style="FONT-FAMILY: Times">.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has asserted
federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities
involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of
drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
In addition, in July 2011, the EPA issued
proposed rules that

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Times"
align=justify>would subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing,
transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs. The EPA proposed rules also include NSPS
standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards
include the reduced emission completion (REC) techniques developed in the EPA's
Natural Gas STAR program. The standards would be applicable to newly drilled and
fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the
proposed regulations under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology
(MACT) standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major
sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards.
Final action on the proposed rules is expected no later than February 28,
2012. We are currently evaluating the effect these proposed rules could have on
our business.
<P

align=justify>In October 2011, the EPA also announced a schedule for development
of standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to
publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The regulations will be developed under
the EPA's Effluent Guidelines Program under the authority of the Clean Water
Act. The EPA anticipates issuing the proposed rules in 2014. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In addition to the EPA’s efforts, legislation has been introduced
before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals
Act, to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. There are
also certain governmental reviews either
underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic
fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been
requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic
fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects
of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with initial results
expected to be available by late 2012 and final results by 2014. In addition,
the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the
agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using
hydraulic fracturing completion methods. Also, the U.S. Department of the
Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic
fracturing on federal lands. 
<P
style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px; FONT-FAMILY: Times"
align=justify>Certain states in which we operate, including Arkansas,
Pennsylvania and Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting,
regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure,
waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing
operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In
addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances,
may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or
hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal
legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in
the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply
with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or
curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production
activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of
wells.

Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or
increased operating costs in
the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the
development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic
fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the
implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially
cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased
compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. <FONT

currently concentrated in our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas and our
Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania. 
Our operating income

Midstream Services segment was $285.1 million in 2011, compared to $220.5
million in 2010 and $141.9 million in 2009.  The increases in 2011 and 2010
operating income and EBITDA were primarily due to increased gathering revenues
and marketing margins, partially offset by increased operating costs and
expenses.  We expect that the operating income and EBITDA of our Midstream
Services segment will increase over the next few years as we continue to develop
our Fayetteville Shale acreage and Marcellus Shale acreage positions.
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to “Business — Other

Gas
Gathering
We engage in gas
gathering activities through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering and
Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering engages in gathering activities in Arkansas
primarily related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play.  In
2011, we invested approximately $160.8 million related to these activities and
had gathering revenues of $408.2 million, compared to $271.3 million invested
and revenues of $316.0 million in 2010 and $214.2 million invested and revenues
of $205.6 million in 2009.  

DeSoto Gathering is
expanding its network of gathering lines and facilities throughout the
Fayetteville Shale play area. During 2011, DeSoto Gathering gathered
approximately 703.6 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play
area, including 57.4 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells.
 During 2010, DeSoto Gathering gathered approximately 562.6 Bcf of natural
gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area, including 56.6 Bcf of natural
gas from third-party wells. In 2009, DeSoto Gathering gathered approximately
367.3 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area, including
26.9 Bcf of natural gas from third-party wells.  The increase in volumes
gathered in over the past three years was primarily due to our growing
production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play.  At the end of 2011,
DeSoto Gathering had approximately 1,791 miles of pipe from the individual
wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment representing in
aggregate approximately 526,625 horsepower had been installed at 61 central
point gathering facilities in the field.  Our gathering revenues are
expected to grow over the next few years largely as a result of increased
development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and the increased
development activity undertaken by other operators in the play area.

Angelina Gathering
currently engages in gathering activities in East Texas and in Pennsylvania.
 At year-end 2011, Angelina Gathering had approximately 25 miles of pipe in
Texas and 13 miles of pipe in Pennsylvania.  At December 31, 2011,
compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 7,100 horsepower
had also been installed at one central point gathering facility in Pennsylvania.
 

Our gathering revenues
are expected to grow over the next few years largely as a result of increased
development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale and the
increased development activity undertaken by other operators in those areas.
  
Gas Marketing
Our gas marketing
subsidiary, SES, allows us to capture downstream opportunities related to
marketing and transportation of natural gas. SES purchases natural gas
production and sells it to end-users and manages the basis and marketing
portfolio and acquires transportation rights on third party pipelines and
gathering lines.  Our current marketing operations primarily relate to the
marketing of our own natural gas production and some third-party natural gas.
 During 2011, we marketed 611.4 Bcf of natural gas, compared to 495.8 Bcf
in 2010 and 382.5 Bcf in 2009.  Of the total volumes marketed, production
from our E&P operated wells accounted for 94% in 2011, compared to 95% in
2010 and 92% in 2009.

SES is a “foundation
shipper” on two pipeline projects serving the Fayetteville Shale play growth,
the Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, or FEP, a 2.0 Bcf per day pipeline that
is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer
Partners, L.P., and two pipeline laterals called the Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals, have already been constructed by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC, or Texas
Gas, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP.  FEP was placed
in-service in January 2011.  SES has a maximum aggregate commitment of
1,200,000 Dekatherms per day for an initial term of ten years from the
in-service date.  SES has maximum aggregate commitments of 800,000 MMBtu
per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville
Lateral. 
   
Prior to the
commencement of service on the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals and the
Fayetteville Express Pipeline, the majority of our natural gas from the Arkoma
Basin was moved to markets in the Midwest and was sold primarily based on two
indices, “NGPL TexOk” and “Centerpoint East.”  The Fayetteville and

transport our natural gas to markets in the eastern United States and
interconnect with Texas Gas Zone 1, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 100, Trunkline Zone
1A, ANR, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 800, Columbia Gulf Mainline, TETCO M1 30" and
Sonat price indices.  We rely in part upon the Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals and the Fayetteville Express Pipeline to service our increased
production from the Fayetteville Shale play.  

During 2011, SES entered
into a number of short and long term firm transportation service and gathering
agreements in support of our growing Marcellus Shale operations in Pennsylvania.
In March 2011, SES entered into a precedent agreement with Millennium Pipeline
Company, L.L.C. pursuant to which it will enter into short and long term
firm natural gas transportation services on Millennium’s existing system and
expansions of the system are expected to be in-service by late 2012 and late
2013.  In June 2011, SES entered into a long term agreement with Bluestone
Gathering, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTE Energy Company, pursuant to which
Bluestone Gathering will build and operate a natural gas gathering system in
Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania and Broome County, New York, and provide
gathering services to SES in support of a portion of our future Marcellus Shale
natural gas production.  The projected in-service date for the gathering
system is expected to be during the third quarter of 2012.  We have also
entered into a 15-year agreement with a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline
Partners for the construction of a gathering system in Susquehanna and
Lackawanna counties in Pennsylvania, which once constructed is expected to have
a delivery capacity of 175,000 Dekatherm/day.  SES also executed firm
transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (“TGP”) that
increase our ability to move its Marcellus Shale natural gas production in the
short term to market as well as a precedent agreement for an expansion project
with a projected in-service date of November 2013 pursuant to which SES has
subscribed for 100,000 Dekatherm/day of capacity.  TGP’s expansion project
will expand its 300 Line in Pennsylvania to provide natural gas transportation
from the Marcellus Shale supply area to existing delivery points on the TGP
system.  TGP filed a certificate application for the project with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in late 2011. Pending regulatory approvals,
construction would begin in 2013, with a projected November 1, 2013 in-service
date.  We have provided certain guarantees of a portion of SES’s
obligations under these agreements.  We refer you to the risk factor “If
our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce our
projected supply of natural gas, our investments in our gathering operations
could be lost.  In addition, our commitments for transportation on
third-party pipelines and gathering systems could make the sale of our natural
gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
financial condition and cash flows.”  

As of December 31, 2011,
SES’s obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation
agreements totaled approximately $2.1 billion and we have not recognized any
guarantee obligations with respect to the firm transportation agreements and the
gathering project and services.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Our gas gathering and marketing activities compete with numerous
other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger
financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are
other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that
are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting
competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of
consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other
transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete
effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing
and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Regulation
In March 2006, the
United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, issued new rules pertaining
to certain gathering lines. Compliance with the new rules has not had a material
adverse impact on our operations. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental
Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with
government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental
protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on
our Midstream Services business.

In November 2008, the
FERC issued a Final Rule in Order No. 720, which requires, in relevant part,
major non-interstate natural gas pipelines to post, on a daily basis, specific
scheduled flow information at each receipt or delivery point with a design
capacity of 15,000 MMBtu per day or more. A “major non-interstate pipeline” is a
pipeline that is not classified as a natural gas company under the Natural Gas
Act (“NGA”) of 1938 and delivers on average more than 50 million MMBtu of
natural gas annually over a three year period.  Our gathering system in
Arkansas constitutes a “major non-interstate pipeline” under Order No. 720. In
October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a
decision granting the Texas Pipeline Association and the Railroad Commission’s
petition for review and vacating FERC’s Order Nos. 720 and 720-A.  In its
order, the 5th Circuit held that Order Nos. 720 and 720-A exceeded the scope of

FERC’s authority under the NGA and that the
FERC cannot require a non-interstate pipeline to post capacity and scheduling
information. Notwithstanding the ruling, Order 720 remains in effect.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion
and amortization.  We have included information concerning EBITDA in this
Form 10-K because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of
a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure
commonly used in our industry.  EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow
data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, or GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.
 EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
of other companies.
We believe that net
income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy is the financial measure
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly
comparable to EBITDA as defined.  The following table reconciles
EBITDA, as defined, with net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy for the years-ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

Environmental Regulation
  

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Our operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in
which we operate.  We have operations in the United States and, to a much
lesser extent, in Canada.  In the United States, we are subject to numerous
federal, state and local laws and regulations including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or the CERCLA, the Clean
Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state statutes.  These laws and
regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding
requirements in order to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing
and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use
and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and
abandoning of wells, the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters.
 We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not
fully insured against all such risks.  Although future environmental
obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our
operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future
developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement
thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or
costs.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result
in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties
and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Changes in environmental
laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more
stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal
or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations
and financial position, as well as those in the natural gas and oil
industry in general.  Although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that
continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material
adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that this will continue in
the future.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations
thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties”
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting
from such spills in United States’ waters.  A “responsible party”
includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel,
or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is
located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil
cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  While
liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage
of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful
misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or
operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate
fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses
exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on
a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans
and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and
restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a
“hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and
companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal
of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were
responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to
joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to
natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or the
RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and
production of natural gas and oil.  The RCRA specifically excludes from the
definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural
gas or geothermal energy.”  However, legislation has been proposed in
Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil
exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the
reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and
clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a
significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and
oil industry in general.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as
paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated
as hazardous waste. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Our activities in Canada have to date been limited to certain
geological and geophysical activities that are not subject to extensive
environmental regulation.  Once we begin exploration activities in New
Brunswick, we will be subject to federal, provincial and local environmental
regulations that we believe require compliance efforts comparable to those
required in the United States.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased,
onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated
with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  Although
we have utilized operating and disposal

practices that
were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may
have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or
leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken
for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties have been operated
by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not
under our control.  These properties and the wastes disposed thereon
may be subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and analogous state
laws.  Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate
previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by
prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater
contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial
plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.   
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA,
imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of
produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters.
 Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to
conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and
similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties
for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges
of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state
discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System general permits issued by the EPA prohibit the discharge
of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain
other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into
coastal waters.  Although the costs to comply with zero discharge
mandates under federal or state law may be significant, the entire industry
is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs
will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or
financial position. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain
natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits
for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of
wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention
plans.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In the past few years, there has been an increased focus on
environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices at the federal, state
and local levels of government although hydraulic fracturing is typically
regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions.  The EPA has asserted
federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities
involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of
drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
 In addition to the EPA’s efforts, legislation has been introduced before
Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,
to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. There are
also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus
on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal
agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of
environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For a discussion of
hydraulic fracturing related environmental legislation, we refer you to
“Exploration and Production — Federal, State and Local Regulation of Hydraulic
Fracturing” and the risk factor “Our financial condition and results of
operation could be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory initiatives
in the United States and Canada relating to hydraulic fracturing that could
result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays or
prevent us realizing the value of undeveloped acreage” in Item 1A of Part I of

“Analogous
reservoir”  Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments,
have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth,
temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more
advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may
provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and
estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an “analogous
reservoir” refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with
the reservoir of interest:

date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the
hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Also referred to as

align=justify>In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K,
the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and
future prospects.  The risk factors described below represent what we

business.  In assessing the risks relating to our business, investors
should also read the other information included in this Form 10-K, including our
financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Cautionary Statement
about Forward-Looking Statements.”
A substantial
or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse
affect on us.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In the first half of 2008, natural gas and oil prices were at or
near their highest historical levels but subsequently natural gas and oil prices
declined significantly.  Natural gas prices declined in 2011 as compared
with 2010 and have continued to decline in the first two months of 2012, and are
not expected to significantly increase in 2012.  The further significant
decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the
quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us.
 A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would
negatively affect us in several ways including:

to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be
severely limited or unavailable.
Consequently, our revenues and
profitability would suffer.
Lower natural
gas and oil prices and/or increased development costs may cause us to record
ceiling test write-downs.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>We use the full cost method of accounting for our natural gas and
oil operations.  Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore
for and develop natural gas and oil properties.  Under the full cost
accounting rules of the SEC, the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil
properties – net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
deferred income taxes – may not exceed a “ceiling limit” on a country-by-country
basis.  This is equal to the present value of estimated future net cash
flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus
the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs
being amortized, net of related tax effects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>These rules generally require pricing future natural gas and oil
production at the unescalated natural gas and oil prices in effect at the end of
each fiscal quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow
hedges, utilizing the average price in the 12-month period prior to the end of
each fiscal quarter, defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices
were defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon
future conditions. They also require a write-down if the ceiling limit is
exceeded.  Once a write-down is taken, it cannot be reversed in future
periods even if natural gas and oil prices increase. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>In the period ended March 31, 2009, we incurred a ceiling test
write-down of $907.8 million which resulted in an operating loss for our company
for 2009. If natural gas and oil prices decline below levels utilized in our
ceiling limit test at December 31, 2011 and/or operating costs, development
costs, transportation costs or basis differentials increase, a write-down may
occur, which would adversely impact our results of operation and financial
condition.  Using the first-day-of-the-month prices of natural gas for the
first two months of 2012 and NYMEX strip prices for the remainder of 2012, as
applicable, the prices required to be used to determine the ceiling limit could
result in a ceiling test write-down in the first quarter of 2012 and are likely
to require ceiling test write-downs in each of the remaining quarters in
2012.
Our level of
indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect
operations and limit our growth.

of locational differentials for our production from the Arkoma Basin and East
Texas, which at any time may further widen due to pipeline or other constraints.
Price volatility makes it difficult to project the return on exploration and
development projects involving our natural gas and oil properties and to
estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or
propose to acquire.  In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt
the market for natural gas and oil properties, as buyers and sellers have more
difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.  Our results of
operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things,
variations in natural gas and oil prices and production performance.  In
recent years, natural gas and oil price volatility has become increasingly
severe.  
The recent adoption of financial reform
legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative
instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other
risks associated with our business which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In July 2010, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed by Congress
and subsequently signed into law.  The new legislation required the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the SEC to promulgate
rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the
date of enactment. The CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for
certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets.  The
financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin
requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in
connection with our derivative activities.  At this time it is not possible
to predict whether or when the CFTC will adopt those rules or include comparable
provisions in its rulemaking under the new legislation or how those rules will
apply to us. The financial reform legislation may also require the
counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their
derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as
the current counterparties, and such developments may affect the business
relationships we have with those counterparties. The new legislation and any new
regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts
(including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect
our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts,
reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks, reduce our
ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase
our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties and limit our access to the
capital necessary to grow our business. If, as a result of the legislation and
regulations, we are no longer able to use derivatives as we have in the past,
our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be
less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund
capital investments. Our revenues could also be adversely affected if a
consequence of the legislation and regulations is lower commodity prices. Any of
these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

Although our
estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our
estimates may still prove to be inaccurate.
Our reserve data
represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision
of our management.  Our reserve estimates are audited each year by
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum
engineering firm.  In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of
NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve
estimates.  NSAI’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which
includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately
90% of present worth of the company’s total proved reserves.  NSAI’s audit
process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and
selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected
fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The
properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the
audit.  The fields included in approximately the top 90% present value as
of December 31, 2011 accounted for approximately 92% of our total proved
reserves and approximately 98% of our proved undeveloped reserves.  In the
conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to
them with respect to ownership interests, oil and natural gas production, well
test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any
agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales
of production.  NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit,
something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or
sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such
information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating
thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the
year-ended December 31, 2011, on January 30, 2012, NSAI issued its audit opinion
as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated
proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been
prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing
of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly.  Our
estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of
reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in
developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other
estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers
prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management.
 Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the
reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property
is assigned.  The reservoir engineering and financial data included in
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset
management teams and our Manager – Capital Budgeting & Reserves, who was the
technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve
estimates, and has over eight years of experience in petroleum engineering,
including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves. He reports to our
Senior Vice President – Corporate Development, who has more than 30 years of
experience in reservoir engineering, including the estimation of oil and gas
reserves in multiple basins both in the United States and internationally.
 On our behalf, the Senior Vice President – Corporate Development engages
NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and
financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our
proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. The financial data
included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting
staff. Following these reviews and the audit, the reserve estimates are
submitted by our Senior Vice President – Corporate Development, to our Chief
Executive Officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our
Board of Directors.  NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the
Board of Directors and final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves
rests with our Board of Directors.  We incorporate many factors and
assumptions into our estimates including:

Although we believe our
assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time
we prepare our estimates, our actual reserves could vary considerably from
estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves (in the aggregate
and for a particular geographic location), production, revenues, taxes and

expenditures.  In addition, our
estimates of reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon
production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing
natural gas and oil prices, severance taxes, operating and development costs and
other factors.  In 2011, our reserves were revised upward by 33.7 Bcfe,
primarily due to improved performance in our Marcellus Shale properties,
partially offset by downward performance revisions in our East Texas, Arkoma and
Fayetteville properties and downward price revisions due to a comparative price
decrease in the average 2011 price from the average 2010 price.  In 2010,
our reserves were revised upward by 309.6 Bcfe, primarily due to improved
performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties and upward price revisions due
to a comparative price increase in the average 2010 price from the average 2009
price, partially offset by downward performance revisions in our East Texas
properties. In 2009, our reserves were revised upward by 92.9 Bcfe, primarily
due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties, partially
offset by downward revisions due to a comparative decrease in the average 2009
price from the year-end 2008 gas price.  These revisions represented no
greater than 7% of our total reserve estimates in each of these years, which we
believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.
 Because we review our reserve projections for every property at the end of
every year, any material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent
reserve reports.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Finally, recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires
significant capital investments and successful drilling operations.  At
December 31, 2011, approximately 2,633 Bcfe of our estimated proved reserves
were undeveloped.  Our reserve data assume that we can and will make these
expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur.
 Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking
Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for additional information
regarding the uncertainty of reserve estimates.
If we fail to
find or acquire additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline
materially from their current levels.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The rate of production from natural gas and oil properties
generally declines as reserves are depleted.  Unless we acquire additional
properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and
development activities, successfully apply new technologies or identify
additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves
will decline materially as reserves are produced.  Future natural gas and
oil production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in
acquiring or finding additional reserves.
Our drilling
plans for the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play are subject to
change.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>As of December 31, 2011, we had drilled and completed 2,380
operated wells relating to our Fayetteville Shale play and 23 operated wells

align=justify>We continue to gather data about our prospects in our operating
areas, and it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our
drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage
position should not be pursued at all.
If we fail to
drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our acreage, the initial lease
terms could expire, which would result in the loss of certain leasehold
rights.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Leases on approximately 235,167 net acres of our Fayetteville
Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful
wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases, of
which 184,696 net acres are held on federal lands.  Approximately 112,832
net acres of our Marcellus Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if
we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action
to extend the leases.  As discussed above under “Our drilling plans for the
Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play are subject to change,” our
ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors
that are beyond our control.  With the exception of the Ozark Highlands
Unit, which is federally leased, the current rules in Arkansas relating to the
Fayetteville Shale provide that each drilling unit would consist of a
governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators are permitted to
drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of supply.
 In Pennsylvania, the location of our Marcellus Shale acreage, there are
currently no rules establishing requirements for drilling units.  However,
current rules in Arkansas may change and rules may be implemented in
Pennsylvania that could impair our ability to drill or maintain our acreage
position.  In addition, other E&P operator drilling activity could
impair our ability to drill and maintain acreage positions.  To the extent
that any field rules prevent us from successfully drilling wells in certain
areas, we may not be able to drill the wells required to maintain our leasehold
rights and our leasehold investments could be lost.
If our
Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce our
projected supply of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations
could be lost.  In addition, our commitments for transportation on
third-party pipelines and gathering systems could make the sale of our natural
gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Through December 31, 2011, we had invested approximately $933.0
million in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale play and
approximately $30.7 million in our gas gathering system built for the Marcellus
Shale play.  To the extent necessary to gather our production, we may make
further substantial investments in the expansion of our gas gathering systems.
 Our gas gathering business will largely rely on natural gas sourced from
our operations.  Our marketing subsidiary has also entered into multiple
firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes produced from our
Fayetteville Shale play as well as a number of firm transportation and gathering
agreements relating to the Marcellus Shale play. As of December 31, 2011, our
aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements
and gathering agreements were approximately $2.1 billion. If our Fayetteville
Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce significant supplies
of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost,
and we could be forced to pay demand or other charges for transportation on
pipelines and gathering systems that we would not be using.  These events
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.
Our
exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may
not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are
subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive
reservoirs will be discovered.  We invest in property, including
undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result in projects that will
add value over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will
result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that leasehold acreage acquired by us

pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our
investment in such leasehold acreage or wells.  Drilling for natural gas
and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from
wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a
profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.  In addition,
wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return.  Our
ability to achieve our target PVI results is dependent upon the current and
future market prices for natural gas and crude oil, costs associated with
producing natural gas and crude oil and our ability to add reserves at an
acceptable cost.  We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other
advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects and in
conducting our exploration activities.  The seismic data and other
technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of
leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether natural gas or oil is present or
may be produced economically.  The use of seismic data and other
technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional
drilling strategies.

cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project.  Further, our
drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
numerous factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, title problems,
pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents,
adverse weather conditions, environmental and other governmental requirements
and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs,

The success of
our New Venture projects is subject to drilling and completion technique risks
and enhanced recovery methods.  Our drilling results may not meet our

completion techniques as developed by ourselves and our service providers in
order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest
possible returns. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited
to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired
drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our
casing the entire length of the well bore, and being able to run tools and other
equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face
while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to
fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the
entire length of the well bore during completion operations, and successfully
cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation
stage.

increase the production of crude oil, natural gas and associated liquids or
employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional
production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery
methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods
do not allow for the
extraction of crude oil, natural gas and associated liquids in a manner or to
the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our
investments in such projects. In addition, if proposed legislation and
regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing become law, the cost of
some of these enhanced recovery methods could increase substantially.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>Ultimately, the success of drilling and completion techniques and
enhanced recovery methods can only be evaluated over time as more wells are
drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time
period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to
execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations,
limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices decline, the return on our
investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated
and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. 
Our financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected by legislative
and regulatory initiatives in the United States and Canada relating to hydraulic
fracturing that could result in increased costs and additional operating
restrictions or delays or prevent us realizing the value of undeveloped acreage.

align=justify>We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operations as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  It is an essential and
common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil,
natural gas, and associated liquids from dense subsurface rock formations. The
knowledge and expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our
operations in the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other
operating areas, currently including our Marcellus Shale acreage and in the
future expected to also include our exploration program in New Brunswick,
Canada. Successful hydraulic fracturing techniques are also expected to be
critical to the development of our recently announced unconventional horizontal
oil play targeting the LSBD formation in Arkansas and Louisiana.  Hydraulic
fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the
hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the
wellbore. In our Fayetteville Shale play, the fracturing fluids we use are
comprised of over 99.9% water and sand. The remaining 0.1% is comprised
of small quantities of additives that contain chemical compounds such as
hydrochloric acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde and sodium chloride which is used
in common household products.

disclosure of the chemicals used in the
hydraulic fracturing process. There are also
certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on
environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal
agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of
environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced
a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on
drinking water and groundwater, with initial results expected to be available by
late 2012 and final results by 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy
is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to
better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing

addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances,
may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or
hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal
legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in
the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply

implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially
cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased

increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and
associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.  In addition,
our E&P operations also require local access to large quantities of water
supplies and disposal services for produced water in connection with our
hydraulic fracture stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs. We
cannot be certain when we will experience shortages or price increases, which
could adversely affect our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or

Our business
could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 24px"
align=justify>The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our
business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better
competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we
frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses,
concessions, marketing agreements, equipment and labor against companies with
financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess.  Many
of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and
productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.
 Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire
additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct
operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in this highly competitive environment.  In addition, many of
our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer

We have made
significant investments in our oilfield service operations, including our
drilling rig and sand mine operations in order to meet certain of our oilfield
service and resource needs, lower our costs and increase of the efficiency of
our operations.  If our exploration and production activities are curtailed
or disrupted, these operations may adversely impact our results of operations.
 In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely

 We may make additional investments to expand these operations in the
future.  Our drilling operations are conducted through our subsidiary, DDI,
which had 404 employees as of December 31, 2011.  We have lease commitments
for 14 drilling rigs and related equipment with respect to DDI's operations and
we also own one drilling rig.  In addition to these rigs, we have contracts
with third-party drilling companies for use of their rigs which may not be
terminable without penalty.  In 2010, another of our subsidiaries, DeSoto
Sand, LLC, began operating our first sand mine in Arkansas in order to meet a
portion of our sand needs for the Fayetteville Shale play. We also purchase sand
for use in our operations from various third parties, including certain of our
oilfield service providers.  Our drilling rig and sand mine operations may
have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party
service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and
resources from other providers.  We may also compete with third-party
providers for qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our
relationships with such providers. If the operations of our drilling rigs and/or

pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in
waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and similar state laws provide for civil,
criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of
pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other
hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced
water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances
related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. The EPA has
also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and
production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Compliance
with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal,
storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic
fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays,
interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be
predicted, all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and
financial condition.

align=justify>Our E&P operations are currently focused on the production of
hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, and we expect to continue to focus on
such resources in the future. The production of hydrocarbons from these sources
has an energy intensity that is a number of times higher than that for
production from conventional sources. Therefore, we expect that the carbon
dioxide, or CO2, intensity of our production will increase in the long-term. We
actively seek to reduce the environmental impact of our operations by
pursuing more efficient use of natural resources such as hydrocarbons and
water and managing and mitigating the emissions to the air, water and soil, with
a focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. With the efforts of our
Health, Safety and Environmental Department, we have been able to plan for and
comply with environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating
strategy. We anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and
expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the
protection of the environment that will increase the cost of equipment,
materials and services whose production utilizes hydrocarbons. We may also face
increased competition from alternative energy sources that do not rely on
hydrocarbons. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our
future exposure concerning such matters and if we are unable to find solutions
to environmental initiatives as they arise, including reducing the CO2 emissions
for our existing projects, we may have additional costs as well as compliance
and operational risks with respect to our existing operations as well as facing
difficulties in pursuing new projects.
Our certificate
of incorporation and, bylaws contain provisions that could make it more
difficult for someone to either acquire us or affect a change of
control.

align=justify>Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
together with any stockholder rights plan that we might have in place, could
discourage an effort to acquire us, gain control of the company, or replace
members of our executive management team. These provisions could potentially
deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our common stock at
above-market prices.
