Business   GeneralMarathon Oil Corporation is a global energy company based in Houston, Texas, with operations in North America, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600.  Each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers.•North America E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America;•International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and•Oil Sands Mining – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil.  We were incorporated in 2001. On June 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC. Strategy and Results SummaryWe have production operations in the U.S., E.G., Canada, the U.K. and Libya.  The focus of our U.S. operations is our three core unconventional resource plays:  the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins.  Our exploration prospects are in E.G., Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the U.S, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("SI7"):1.Living Our Values 2.Investing in Our People 3.Continuous Improvement in Operational and Capital Efficiency 4.Driving Profitable and Sustainable Growth5.Rigorous Portfolio Management 6.Quality and Material Resource Capture 7.Delivering Long-Term Shareholder Value In 2014, we continued to focus on liquid hydrocarbon reserves, realizing substantial increases in our three unconventional resource plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins.  In 2014, our U.S. operations added 288 mmboe proved reserves, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the prior year's ending balance. For the total company, we ended 2014 with proved reserves of approximately 2,198 mmboe, compared to 2,171 mmboe at the end of 2013.  Excluding proved reserves of 106 mmboe related to our Angola and Norway discontinued operations, proved reserves related to continuing operations increased from 2,065 mmboe at the end of 2013 to 2,198 mmboe at the end of 2014 for an increase of 6 percent. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. In 2014, we executed two strategic dispositions for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion.  We closed the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter and our Norway business in the fourth quarter.   During 2014, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for $1 billion.  Our cash additions to property, plant and equipment related to continuing operations were $5.2 billion, primarily funded with cash flow from operations, with more than 70 percent of that related to our Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins where net sales volumes increased 35 percent year-over-year.  5See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outlook, for discussion of our 2015 Budget.The map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations.Segment and Geographic InformationFor operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.In the following discussion regarding our North America E&P, International E&P and Oil Sands Mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.North America E&P SegmentWe are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the U.S. and Canada.Unconventional Resource PlaysEagle Ford - As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 180,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford in south Texas and 954 gross (714 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011.  During 2014, we reached total depth on 360 gross operated wells and brought 310 gross operated wells to sales, compared to 299 reaching total depth and 307 brought to sales in 2013.  Included with the Eagle Ford well counts noted above, were 22 gross operated Austin Chalk wells brought online in 2014 and the first four Upper Eagle Ford wells which were brought online late in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Our 2014 average spud-to-TD time was 13 days compared to 12 days in 2013.  Our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in 2014.  This higher pad density and the longer laterals being drilled in 2014 contribute to the slightly higher spud-to-TD time in 2014. Throughout 2013, we evaluated the potential of downspacing to 40-acre and 60-acre spacing with several pilot programs.  Wells drilled in these programs at closer spacing showed improved completion efficiency which helped offset impacts due to tighter well spacing.  The continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity.  Eagle Ford net sales in 2014 were 112 mboed, 65 percent crude oil and condensate, 17 percent NGLs and 18 percent natural gas, compared to 81 mboed in 2013, a 38 percent increase.  In 2014, we transported approximately 70 percent of our 6Eagle Ford production by pipeline and anticipate this to increase to 90 percent in 2015 as additional pipeline capacity is constructed and completed.  The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. During 2014, we continued evaluation of the Austin Chalk formation across our Eagle Ford acreage position in south Texas, delineating 18,000 initial Austin Chalk acres and bringing online 22 wells.  Initial Austin Chalk production results indicate that the mix of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas is similar to Eagle Ford condensate wells.  We plan to drill 56 to 62 additional gross wells in the Austin Chalk formation in 2015.  Co-development of the Austin Chalk and Lower Eagle Ford will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the Eagle Ford operating area.  During the fourth quarter of 2014, the first four Upper Eagle Ford wells were brought online and we spud our first four-well pilot with Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, and two Lower Eagle Ford wells.We operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford area.  We now have 31 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 460 mboed. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 37-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa, and Bee Counties of south Texas.Approximately 40 percent of our 2015 Budget, $1.4 billion, is allocated to the Eagle Ford.  Our drilling plans for 2015 include drilling 141 - 152 net wells  (245 - 260 gross, of which we will operate 215 - 225), a decrease of approximately 40 percent over 2014.  We anticipate bringing 255 - 275 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.Bakken – We hold approximately 290,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006.  Since inception, we have continuously sought improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques.  We began high-density spacing pilots in 2014, with each pad comprised of six Middle Bakken formation and six Three Forks first bench formation wells per drilling-spacing unit.  We continue to execute an enhanced completion design pilot program, including elevated proppant volumes, hybrid slickwater fracs, increased stages and cemented liners, with 42 of the 55 tests online at the end of 2014. Our time to drill a well averaged 17 days spud-to-TD in 2014 compared to 15 days in 2013.  We reached TD on 83 gross operated wells and brought to sales 67 gross operated wells in 2014 compared to 76 reaching total depth and 77 brought to sales in 2013.  We recompleted 35 wells during 2014.  Our net sales from the Bakken shale averaged 51 mboed in 2014, approximately 88 percent crude oil, 6 percent NGLs and 6 percent natural gas, compared to 39 mboed in 2013, a 31 percent increase.  In efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state.Approximately 20 percent of our 2015 Budget, $760 million, is allocated to the Bakken.  Our 2015 Bakken program includes plans to drill 42 - 53 net wells (100 - 120 gross, of which we will operate 38 - 48). We anticipate bringing 68 - 78 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.Oklahoma Resource Basins – Our primary focus in 2015 will be in the SCOOP and STACK areas.  In the SCOOP area we hold approximately 145,000 net acres with rights to the unconventional Woodford, Springer, Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian sands plays.  We also hold approximately 100,000 net acres in the STACK area with rights to the unconventional Woodford, Meramec and other Mississippian plays.  These totals include over 50,000 acres added in the SCOOP and STACK areas in 2014.  Though not a focus of the 2015 program, we also hold 57,000 net acres in the broader western Oklahoma Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian sands plays.  In the SCOOP and STACK areas, we reached total depth on 17 gross operated wells and brought 18 gross operated wells to sales in 2014 compared to 10 reaching total depth and nine brought to sales in 2013.  A total of nine net non-operated unconventional wells were brought to sales in 2014 compared to three in 2013.   Sales from our Oklahoma Resource Basins in 2014 were primarily from the Anadarko Woodford shale and averaged 18 mboed, approximately 16 percent crude oil, 28 percent NGLs and 56 percent natural gas, compared to 14 mboed in 2013, a 29 percent increase.  Approximately 6 percent of our 2015 Budget, $226 million, is allocated to the Oklahoma Resource Basins.  Our drilling plans for the Oklahoma Resource Basins in 2015 include drilling and completing 17 - 20 net wells (41 - 50 gross of which 16 - 20 are company operated wells).  We anticipate bringing 18 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.See below for discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas, production operations in Oklahoma.7Other United StatesGulf of Mexico – Production – On December 31, 2014, we held significant interests in 11 producing fields, four of which are company-operated.  Average net sales in 2014 from the Gulf of Mexico were 14 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 16 mmcfd of natural gas, or 17 mboed compared to 19 mboed in 2013.  Operational availability for our operated properties was 96 percent, with internal unplanned losses of four percent.We have a 65 percent operated working interest in the Ewing Bank Block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The platform serves as a production hub for the Lobster, Oyster and Arnold fields on Ewing Bank Blocks 873, 917 and 963.  The facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. We have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830, located 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, which includes 15 producing wells.  The Petronius platform is also capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. We hold a 30 percent non-operated working interest in the Neptune field located on Atwater Valley Block 575, 120 miles south off the coast of Louisiana.  The development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform.  A new Neptune sidetrack well came online late December 2014.We have an 18 percent non-operated working interest in the Gunflint field development located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992(N/2) and 993(N/2), 90 miles south off the coast of Louisiana.  The discovery well was drilled in 2008 and encountered pay in the Middle Miocene reservoirs. Two subsequent appraisal wells were drilled and evaluated in 2012 and 2013. The subsea tie-back development project will continue to progress in 2015, with first oil expected in 2016. Gulf of Mexico – Exploration – We have a 3-year shared contract on the Maersk Valiant drillship and plan to utilize the rig to test prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, including one operated exploration well in 2015.  As we evaluate various opportunities for drilling, we may seek partners to further reduce our exploration risk on individual projects.A deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 52, was drilled in 2009.  We own a 10 percent non-operated working interest in this prospect.  The first appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful.  The second appraisal well was spud in late May 2014 and the well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2014.  A third appraisal well is anticipated to spud on Walker Ridge Block 51 in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we drilled two exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico: one on the Key Largo prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 578, in which we have a 60 percent working interest and one on the Perseus prospect, located on Desoto Canyon Block, in which we have a 30 percent non-operated working interest.  Neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense.  We have no further plans to explore either prospect. Oklahoma – We have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production in several Oklahoma fields from which sales averaged 8 mboed in 2014 and 9 mboed in 2013. Texas/North Louisiana/New Mexico – We hold approximately 242,000 net acres in these areas of which approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas shale plays.  Most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production.  We participated in one gross non-operated well in the Haynesville shale play during 2014.  Conventional production was primarily from the Mimms Creek, Pearwood and Haynesville fields in 2014, with net sales averaging 5 mboed in both 2014 and 2013.  We also participate in several non-operated Permian Basin fields in west Texas and New Mexico.  Net sales from this area averaged 7 mboed in 2014. Wyoming – We have ongoing enhanced oil recovery waterflood projects at the mature Bighorn Basin and Wind River Basin fields and at our 100 percent owned and operated Pitchfork field.  We have conventional natural gas operations in the Greater Green River Basin.  Operated production at the Powder River Basin field ceased in March 2014, and plug and abandonment activities were substantially complete as of December 31, 2014.Our Wyoming net sales averaged 16 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 11 mmcfd of natural gas, or 18 mboed, during 2014 compared to 22 mboed in 2013.  We drilled 11 gross operated development wells in Wyoming in 2014.   In addition, we own and operate the 420-mile Red Butte Pipeline.  This crude oil pipeline connects Silvertip Station on the Montana/Wyoming state line to Casper, Wyoming.   8Canada We hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in Alberta, Canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction.  These leases cover approximately142,000 gross (54,000 net) acres in four project areas: Namur, in which we hold a 70 percent operated interest; Birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest; and Saleski in which we hold a 33 percent non-operated interest.During 2012, we submitted a regulatory application relating to our Canada in-situ assets at Birchwood, for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") demonstration project.  We expect to receive regulatory approval for this project by the end of 2015.  Upon receiving this approval, we will further evaluate our development plans. North America E&P--AcquisitionsIn an asset acquisition that closed August 2014, we added acreage to our Oklahoma Resource Basins at a cost of approximately $80 million before final settlement adjustments. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired additional acreage in the SCOOP, at a cost of approximately $60 million before final settlement adjustments.International E&P SegmentWe are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in E.G., Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K.  We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment.AfricaEquatorial Guinea – Production – We own a 63 percent operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G.  During 2014, E.G. net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 31 mbbld and net natural gas sales averaged 439 mmcfd, or 104 mboed, compared to 107 mboed in 2013.  Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 98 percent in 2014, with internal unplanned losses of one percent.  A compression project designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years is underway and is expected to be operational in 2016. Dry natural gas from the Alba field, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed by Alba Plant LLC, as discussed below, is supplied to AMPCO and EGHoldings under long-term contracts at fixed prices.  Because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in E.G., we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, EGHoldings and AMPCO  to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances.  Any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba field for later production.  Equatorial Guinea – Exploration – We hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80 percent operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D.  We plan to develop Block D through a unitization with the Alba field, which is currently being negotiated.  We also have an 80 percent operated working interest in exploratory Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. The Sodalita West #1 exploratory well was spud during 2014 and reached total depth in February 2015.  This well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense in the fourth quarter of 2014.  A second exploratory well and one Alba field infill well are expected to be drilled in 2015.Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing – We own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island.  Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant.  Under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations.  During 2014, the gross quantity of natural gas supplied to the LPG production facility was 856 mmcfd, from which 6 mbbld of secondary condensate and 19 mbbld of LPG were produced by Alba Plant LLC.  We also own 60 percent of EGHoldings and 45 percent of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments.  EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island.  These facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the Alba field.  EGHoldings' 3.7 mmta LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023.  The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index.  Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 4 mmta in 2014.  Operational availability was 98 percent in 2014, including a planned turnaround, while internal unplanned losses were less than one percent. 9AMPCO had gross sales totaling 885 mt in 2014.  Operational availability for this methanol plant was 90 percent in 2014, and internal unplanned losses were ten percent.  Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S.  Libya – We hold a 16 percent non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, our Libya operations were impacted by third-party labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal. In early July 2014, Libya's National Oil Corporation rescinded force majeure associated with the third-party labor strikes, and our concession term was extended for slightly more than one year.  Although we had five liftings during 2014, in December 2014, Libya’s National Oil Corporation once again declared force majeure at Es Sider as disruptions from civil unrest continue.  Considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels.  We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in Libya.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations.Gabon – Exploration – We hold a 21.25 percent non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres.  The Diaman-1B well reached total depth in the third quarter of 2013, encountering 160-180 net feet of hydrocarbon pay in the deepwater pre-salt play.  Analysis confirmed dry gas accumulation with minor condensate.  Multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this License.  In 2014, 3D seismic acquisition was completed in the western part of the block.In August 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Gabon offshore Block G13, which was subsequently re-named Tchicuate.  The block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore Gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. The seismic program is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2015, and processing will occur through the remainder of the year.  We hold a 100 percent participating interest and operatorship in the block.  In the event of development, the Republic of Gabon will assume a 20 percent financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production.  The State holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor. Kenya – Exploration – We hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in Block 9, consisting of approximately 3.9 million gross (1.9 million net) acres in northwest Kenya.  The Sala-1 exploration well was spud in February 2014 on the eastern side of Block 9 and made a natural gas discovery in the second quarter of 2014.  The well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 10,000 feet, and analysis indicated three zones of interest over a 3,280-foot gross interval which were subsequently drill-stem tested.  The Sala-2 appraisal well spud in the third quarter of 2014, but did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, and the well costs were charged to dry well expense.  We hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in Block 9 with the option to operate any commercial development. We also hold a 15 percent non-operated working interest in Block 12A, covering approximately 3.8 million gross (566,000 net) acres, which is also located in northwest Kenya.  The acquisition of 2D seismic on Block 12A began in 2013 and was completed in 2014.  Multiple prospects have been identified and the first exploratory well is anticipated to be drilled in late 2015.Ethiopia – Exploration – We hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the onshore South Omo Block in Ethiopia.  The concession has an area of approximately 5.4 million gross (1.1 million net) acres.  Two wells were drilled on the South Omo Block in 2014:  the Shimela-1 well, which reached total depth in May 2014, and the Gardim-1 well, which reached total depth in July 2014.  Neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs were charged to dry well expense during 2014. We have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the Rift Basin Area Block with approximately 10.5 million gross acres.  We began 2D seismic acquisition in the first quarter of 2015 in order to develop prospect inventory for a future drilling program.  We have the option to operate if a discovery is made.Other – An outbreak of the Ebola virus has existed in certain regions of West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) since late 2013.  Although neither E.G. nor any other African country in which we have business activities has been impacted by Ebola to date, our business operations may be adversely affected through travel or other restrictions. We continue to monitor the situation, have enhanced our emergency response plans to address any potential impact, and are working closely with appropriate external parties to maintain business continuity and the health and well-being of our staff.Other InternationalUnited Kingdom – Net sales from the U.K. averaged 11 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 28 mmcfd of natural gas, or 16 mboed, in 2014 compared to 20 mboed in 2013.  Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the East Brae field.  The Brae Alpha platform and facilities host the South, Central and West Brae fields.  The North Brae and East Brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the Brae Bravo and the East Brae platforms, respectively.  The East Brae platform also hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent 10working interest.  Operational availability in 2014 for the Brae complex was 90 percent and internal unplanned losses were nine percent.  We brought two South Brae infill wells online late in the second half of 2014 and plan to complete two West Brae subsea wells and one additional South Brae infill well in 2015.The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986.  Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure.  In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50 percent non-operated interest in the  SAGE system.  The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day.  The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and a 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields.  The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market.  All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas.   Croatia – We were awarded, as part of a consortium, seven blocks located offshore in the Adriatic Sea, subject to negotiation of a PSC with the Croatian Government.  We have a 60 percent interest in the consortium. Kurdistan Region of Iraq – In aggregate, we have approximately 109,000 net acres in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  We have a 45 percent operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil. For a short time in 2014, we suspended certain operations due to security concerns in the region and continue to closely monitor the situation.  We also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with 15 percent working interest and Sarsang with 20 percent working interest.  On the non-operated Atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources approved a plan for field development in September 2013.  The development project consists of drilling three production wells and constructing a central processing facility in Phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period.  We expect first production in late 2015 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil.  Subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential Phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility.  The Atrush-3 appraisal well, within the potential Phase 2 development area approximately four miles east of existing wells, confirmed the extension of the oil bearing reservoirs in 2013 and has been suspended as a potential future producer. On the non-operated Sarsang block, the Swara Tika discovery was declared commercial in May 2014 and a field development plan was filed in June 2014.  Currently, the East Swara Tika-1 exploration well is being sidetracked up-dip. Discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Natural Resources to finalize the Swara Tika field development plan. On the operated Harir block, we spud the Mirawa-2 appraisal well in December 2014 which is expected to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2015.  In December 2014, we announced the Jisik-1 discovery and in 2013, the Mirawa-1 discovery.  Both the Jisik-1 and Mirawa-1 exploratory wells had discovered multiple stacked oil and natural gas producing zones, and have been suspended for potential future use as producing wells.  Acquisitions and DispositionsIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we closed the sale of our Norway business, including the operated Alvheim FPSO, 10 operated licenses and a number of non-operated licenses on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the North Sea, with an effective date of January 1, 2014 for proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion.In the first quarter of 2014, we closed the sales of our 10 percent non-operated working interests in the Production Sharing Contracts and Joint Operating Agreements for Angola Blocks 31 and 32 for aggregate proceeds of approximately $2 billion.

In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition.  Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations.  Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry.  In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses.The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our North America E&P and International E&P segments combined as of December 31, 2014.

If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses, or concessions, undeveloped acreage listed in the table below will expire over the next three years.  We plan to continue the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions.

The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil.  The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines.  Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. The AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils.  Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques.  The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles.  The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry.  The slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth.  A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes.  The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently.  The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile Corridor Pipeline. The AOSP's Scotford upgrader is located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta.  The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products.  Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products.  The upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil.  The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.As of December 31, 2014, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 163,000 gross (33,000 net) acres.  The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta.  Synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2014 averaged 50 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 41 mbbld.In December 2013, a Jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the Canadian government.  The project includes additional mining areas, associated processing facilities and infrastructure.  The government conditions relate to wildlife, the environment and aboriginal health issues.  We will evaluate the potential expansion project and government conditions after infrastructure reliability initiatives are completed.The governments of Alberta and Canada have agreed to partially fund Quest CCS for $865 million Canadian.  In the third quarter of 2012, the Energy and Resources Conservation Board ("ERCB"), Alberta's primary energy regulator at that time, conditionally approved the project and the AOSP partners approved proceeding to construct and operate Quest CCS.   Government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases.  Failure of the AOSP to meet certain timing, performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding.  Construction and commissioning of Quest CCS is expected to be completed by late 2015. 14ReservesEstimated Reserve QuantitiesReserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves.  A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent.  Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  We closed the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and our Norway business in the fourth quarter of 2014, and both are shown as discontinued operations ("Disc Ops") for all periods presented.  Approximately 76 percent of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries. Our December 31, 2014 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in 2014 within the 12-month period.  The 2014 unweighted averages for certain of the benchmark prices were as follows:•WTI crude oil - $94.99 per bbl•Henry Hub natural gas - $4.31 per mmbtu•Brent crude oil - $101.39 per bblWhen determining the December 31, 2014 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted with price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences.  Beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil benchmarks began to decline and this decline continued into early 2015.  In addition, the Henry Hub natural gas benchmark began to decline in late 2014 and continued its decline into 2015.  Commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further.  The January 2015 benchmark closing prices for the first day of the month were WTI crude oil of $52.69 per bbl, Henry Hub natural gas of $2.99 per mmbtu and Brent crude oil of $55.55 per bbl.  Sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves.  To the extent that we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices in 2015, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved.  Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing the reserves as of the end of the year.  The decline in commodity prices experienced in the second half of  2014 has resulted in a reduction in the costs of developing and producing reserves.  The impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future cash flows will be partially offset by the impact of lower costs.  A sustained period of lower commodity prices could also cause us to decrease our near term capital programs and defer investment until prices improve.  A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods outside of five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves.  See . Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America.  Additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market.  Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.Our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve.  Generally, results from oil and gas production and OSM operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices.  Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.  See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Overview – Market Conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations.20Environmental, Health and Safety MattersThe Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters.  Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs.  We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety.  These laws and regulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA")) with respect to water discharges, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the Endangered Species Act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories.  In addition, many other states and countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. These laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal.  In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them.  New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.  Based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the CAA and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.  We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.Air and Climate ChangeThe EPA proposed a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in December 2014.   A more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process.  Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with any regulation or other action by the EPA that lowers the ozone NAAQS, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented.In August 2012, the EPA published final New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP") that amended existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and gas facilities as well as created a new NSPS for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2015.  While these rules remain in effect, the EPA announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years.  The EPA has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected.  In December 2014, the EPA issued finalized additional amendments to these rules that, among other things, distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements.  Further, in 2012, seven states sued the EPA to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources is appropriate and, if so, to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources.  In April 2014, the EPA released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry, and, based on responses received, announced in early 2015 that it will begin the process of issuing a rule governing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.  If we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our 21operations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations.  These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.  Obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects, including the construction and operation of facilities. In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions.  Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding potential methane regulation by EPA).  These requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate.  Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations.  The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time.  For additional information, see . Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business.  The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.Prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil fluctuate widely.  Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil.  Historically, the markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.  For example, beginning in the second half of 2014 and continuing into 2015, the WTI and Brent crude oil benchmarks have substantially declined.  In addition, the Henry Hub natural gas benchmark began to decline in late 2014 and continued its decline into 2015.  Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are beyond our control.  These factors include:•worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;•the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions;•political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;•changes in weather patterns and climate;•natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;•the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;•the effect of conservation efforts;•epidemics or pandemics;•technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and•general economic conditions worldwide.The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices could have adverse effects on our business, including:•reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically;•reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;•causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, or delay or postpone some of our capital projects, resulting in lower production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; •requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets;•reducing the amounts of our estimated proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves that we may produce economically;•reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and•limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt and/or increasing the costs of obtaining such capital.25A substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, which could negatively impact our financial results. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas transportation, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. The inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our financial results.Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment.  Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers.  Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities.Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates.  Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves.The proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering estimates. Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group.  The synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands.  Reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates.  For 2014, the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period were WTI crude oil of $94.99 per bbl, Henry Hub natural gas of $4.31 per mmbtu and Brent crude oil of $101.39 per bbl.  Any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves.  The January 2015 benchmark closing prices for the first day of the month were WTI crude oil of $52.69 per bbl, Henry Hub natural gas of $2.99 per mmbtu and Brent crude oil of $55.55 per bbl.  To the extent that we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices in 2015, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved.  Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured.  (Bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.)  Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:•location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;•historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;•volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;•the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;•assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and•industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data.  Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:•the amount and timing of production;•the revenues and costs associated with that production; and•the amount and timing of future development expenditures.26The discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties.  As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.  Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced.  Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline.  Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:•obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas;•drilling success;•the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;•the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and•the ability to fund such activity.Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs.Drilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs.  The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:•unexpected drilling conditions;•title problems;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering;•lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and•shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results.  Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce.  Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;•unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;•disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;27•increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; •adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;•shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;•market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and•nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects.We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security.  We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements.  To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected.  The specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes.  We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination.  In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations.  Our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, and Norway, and the European Union.  Internationally, member countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol have made additional commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto protocol, but may do so in the future.  The EPA has announced its intention to specifically regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs.  These costs and capital expenditures could be material.  Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.  Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented.  For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions.  Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing.  In addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the EPA research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health.Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.  Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to 28operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.  The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. Worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us.  A total of 41 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes related to continuing operations in 2014 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 55 percent of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2014 were located outside the U.S.  All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada.  We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S.  There are many risks associated with operations in countries such as E.G., Angola, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Libya, and in global markets including: •changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation;•other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;•political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances;•the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and•fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.For the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.  Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest.  If such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the U.S.  These may have the following results, among others:•volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;•security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;•damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations.Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries.  A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.  These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil.  In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.Actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries.29Our commodity price risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk.  In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.  See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. Our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market.  Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including “cloud” computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks.  While our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future.  As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints.The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. Both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil.If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties.  Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems.  Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements.  Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties.  Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates.  In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.We operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do.  We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties.  We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users.  Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties.  They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel.  30Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations.  However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator.  We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations.  In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.Our North America E&P and International E&P operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. Our OSM operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks.  These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us.  Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.  We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions.  In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates.  As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further.  In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive.  As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future.  The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations.  In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances.  If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability.  We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities.  In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.In connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities.  However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities.  However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.  In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 31355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling.  Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.  Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling.  In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code.  The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion.  The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received.  That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off.  For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain.  We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares.Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the Tax Sharing Agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates.  However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes.We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine.  The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.  For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions.  Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.Item 1B
