Item 1A.    Risk Factors
 The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most
important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:  The global economic crisis may continue to harm the
Company’s business and financial condition.    The world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business
spending. Given the nature of the Company’s business, financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur. In the past, the Company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand
for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods. This impact on the Company’s business could be further dramatized given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets.

 Any reduction in global economic activity may harm the
Company’s business.    The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s
clients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific
industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary and
permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. If the Company’s clients
become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base
may be harmed.  The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hour
related claims that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on
behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the
misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime
compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial
resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome with
respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business. 
The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in international
markets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. The European market has been experiencing on-going economic uncertainty which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company’s operations in
Europe. To the extent that these adverse economic conditions in Europe continue or worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these international
operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations,
U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In
addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar
strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. 
The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    The
Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary
or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.

 The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be
unable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have
greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins. 
The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Company’s temporary services
business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees,
the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not
historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of
liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While
such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that
such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company. 
The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could
harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon
tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Company’s business
is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to
obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.
In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the
employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such
as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) were signed into law in the United States. The Health Care Reform Laws include a large number of health-related provisions, including requiring
most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, beginning in 2015 penalties will be assessed on large employers
who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to the Company’s employees, or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided, will
increase the Company’s expense. If the Company is unable to raise the rates it charges its clients to cover this expense, such increases in expense could harm the Company’s financial results.

 The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are
vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and
communications hardware and software systems. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches,
catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees.  Failure to maintain adequate financial and
management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s
financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate
financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall. 
The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may
decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand
for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to
five years after their initial public offering. This or other similar delays or modifications of the Sarbanes Oxley requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services. 
Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue.    Because
long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. 
Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services
business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so. 
Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established
reputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources
than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period
of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no
assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.  Protiviti’s operations
could subject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or
Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.
