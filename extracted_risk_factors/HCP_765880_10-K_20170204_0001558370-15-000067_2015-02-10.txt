			PART I
		
		
			ITEM 1.    Business
		
		
			General Overview
		
		
			HCP, an S&P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We are a Maryland corporation organized in 1985 and qualify as a self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”). We are headquartered in Irvine, California, with offices in Nashville, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. Our diverse portfolio is comprised of investments in the following healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. 
		
		
			Portfolio Summary: At December 31, 2014, we managed $24.3 billion of investments in our Owned Portfolio and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and owned $483 million of assets under Development and Redevelopment.
		
		
			Owned Portfolio. At December 31, 2014, our leases, operating properties and debt investments in our owned portfolio consisted of the following (square feet and dollars in thousands):

			Business Strategy 
		
		
			We invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the long-term to maximize the benefit to our shareholders and support the growth of our dividends. The core elements of our strategy are: (i) to acquire, develop, lease, own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations (including Europe); (ii) to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies, operators and service providers, which over the long-term should result in higher relative rental rates, net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values; (iii) to concentrate on longer-term escalating triple-net leases with high-quality tenants, while using RIDEA structures for properties that have higher growth potential; (iv) to maintain adequate liquidity with long-term fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities, which supports the longer-term nature of our investments, while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles; and (v) to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40% relative to our assets.
		
		
			Internal Growth Strategies
		
		
			We believe that our longer-term escalating triple-net leases with financially strong tenants and operators enhance the quality, stability and growth of our rental income. Further, we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing, other approvals and/or financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to: (i) work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and (ii) provide high-quality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew, expand or relocate into our properties. 
		
		
			We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:  
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Build and maintain long-term leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators. In choosing locations for our properties, we focus our attention on their physical environment, adjacency to established businesses (e.g., hospital systems) and educational centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors.
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Replace tenants and operators quickly at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location, design and maintenance of our properties, together with our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios.
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration. We structure lease extensions, early renewals or modifications, which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the re-investment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants’ purchase options, while securing the tenancy and/or relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a long-term basis.
		
			Investment Strategies
		
		
			The delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the: (i) compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services; (ii) specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and (iii) ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.
		
		
			While we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership, we may also provide real estate secured financing to, or invest in equity or debt securities of, healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership. We may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies. We may co-invest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies.
		
		
			We monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment vehicle or geographic location, the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator, or loans that may be made to a single borrower. In allocating capital to our multiple segments, we target

		opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for our portfolio as a whole. We may take additional measures to mitigate risk, including diversifying our investments (by sector, geography, tenant or operator), structuring transactions as master leases, requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications, and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.
		
		
			We believe we are well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions, financing and development. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:  
		
		
			 
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our reputation gained through nearly 30 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our relationships with leading healthcare operators, private equity firms, corporations, non-profits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality healthcare real estate assets;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing due to the strength of our experienced management team and balance sheet liquidity;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently, which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our control of sites (including assets under contract with radius restrictions).
		
			Financing Strategies
		
		
			Because our REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains), we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments, develop and redevelop properties, and refinance maturing debt. 
		
		
			We may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			issuance of common or preferred stock; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			issuance or origination of debt, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			borrowings under our credit facility; or
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments. 
		
			We maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit facility, access to capital markets and secured debt lenders, relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners, and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt obligations are primarily long-term fixed rate with staggered maturities, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations.
		
		
			We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing by offering equity and debt securities, placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders.

			Competition
		
		
			Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, pension funds, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater flexibility (e.g., non-REIT competitors), resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete may also be impacted by global, national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends.
		
		
			Income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care provided, reputation, success of product or drug development, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment programs, and government reimbursement, as well as the effect of laws and regulations, may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business, see “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this report.
		
		
			Healthcare Segments 
		
		
			Senior housing.  At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 479 senior housing facilities, including 14 properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. Our senior housing facilities are primarily triple-net leased and include independent living facilities (“ILFs”), assisted living facilities (“ALFs”), memory care facilities (“MCFs”), care homes, and continuing care retirement communities (“CCRCs”), which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs. Services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our senior housing property types are further described below:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Independent Living Facilities.  ILFs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded socially by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living (“ADL”). However, in some of our facilities, residents have the option to contract for these services. At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 64 ILFs.
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Assisted Living Facilities.  ALFs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with ADL, such as bathing, eating, dressing and medication management, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may dedicate a portion of a facility that offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 345 ALFs.
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Memory Care Facilities.  MCFs address the unique challenges of our residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Residents may live in semi-private apartments or private rooms and have structured activities delivered by staff members trained specifically on how to care for residents with memory impairment. These facilities offer programs that provide comfort and care in a secure environment for residents with memory loss issues in comfortable settings. At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 21 MCFs.
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			Care Homes (United Kingdom).  Care homes offer personal care services, such as lodging, meal services, housekeeping and laundry services, medication management and assistance with ADL. Care homes are registered to provide different levels of services, ranging from personal care to nursing care. Some homes can be further registered for a specific care need, such as dementia or terminal illness. At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 23 care homes.

				 ·
			
		
			
			Continuing Care Retirement Communities.  CCRCs offer several levels of assistance, including independent living, assisted living and nursing home care. CCRCs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they usually provide written agreements or long-term contracts between residents and the communities (frequently lasting the term of the resident's lifetime), which offer a continuum of housing, services and healthcare on one campus or site. CCRCs are appealing as they allow residents to “age in place.”  CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 26 CCRCs.
		
			Our senior housing segment accounted for approximately 39%, 36% and 33% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following table provides information about our senior housing tenant/operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2014:

			On July 31, 2014, Brookdale completed its acquisition of Emeritus Corporation (“Emeritus”). Percentages of segment and total revenues presented are prepared on a pro forma basis to reflect the combined concentration for Brookdale and Emeritus, as if the merger had occurred as of the beginning of 2014. On August 29, 2014, HCP and Brookdale amended or terminated all former leases with Emeritus and entered into two RIDEA joint ventures (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Brookdale Transaction). Percentages do not include senior housing facilities that Brookdale manages (is not a tenant) under a RIDEA structure.
		
			
				 (2)
			
		
			
			Percentage of total revenues includes revenues earned from both senior housing and post-acute/skilled nursing facilities leased to HCRMC.
		
			We have entered into long-term agreements with Brookdale to manage properties that are operated under a structure permitted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as “RIDEA”). Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease a “qualified healthcare property” on an arm’s length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.” RIDEA structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities (as compared to leasing the property for contractual triple-net rents) in a tax efficient manner. We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and/or growth profiles by: (i) transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale, operating efficiencies, and/or ancillary services; or (ii) investing capital to reposition the asset. Brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to our senior housing RIDEA properties, for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements. Most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, with 5-year renewals. The base management fees are 4.5% to 5.0% of gross revenues (as defined) generated by the RIDEA facilities. In addition, there are incentive management fees payable to Brookdale if operating results of the RIDEA properties exceed pre-established EBITDAR (as defined) thresholds. As of January 1, 2015, 83 properties are under RIDEA structures, 14 of which are owned by our CCRC unconsolidated joint venture (discussed below in Item 7).
		
		
			Post-acute/skilled nursing.  At December 31, 2014, we had interests in 301 post-acute/skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”). SNFs offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people following a hospital stay or not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy, as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Post-acute/skilled nursing services provided by our tenants and operators in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations or “HMOs”) or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of our SNFs are triple-net leased.

			Life science.  At December 31, 2014, we had interests in and managed 115 life science properties, including four facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical, and heating, ventilating and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops and related amenities. In many instances, life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or medical device research initiatives. 
		
		
			Life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants. Our properties are located in well-established geographical markets known for scientific research, including San Francisco and San Diego, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, Durham, North Carolina and Boston, Massachusetts. At December 31, 2014, 97% of our life science properties were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet).
		
		
			Our life science segment accounted for approximately 14%, 14% and 15% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

			Medical office.  At December 31, 2014, we had interests in and managed 281 medical office buildings (“MOBs”), including 66 facilities owned by our significant unconsolidated joint ventures. MOBs typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices), with approximately 79% of our MOBs, based on square feet, located on hospital campuses and 94% are affiliated with hospital systems. At December 31, 2014, 48% of our medical office buildings were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet).

			Hospital.  At December 31, 2014, we had interests in and managed 20 hospitals, including four facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. Services provided by our tenants and operators in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and HMOs) or through Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. All of our hospitals are triple-net leased.
		
		
			Our hospital segment accounted for approximately 4%, 4% and 5% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

			Sustainability
		
		
			We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility, which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth. We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability, with a focus on achieving goals in each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions of sustainability.
		
		
			Our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors, tenants, operators and employees, while making a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. Our social responsibility team leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities, and our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component to achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks.
		
		
			Our 2014 sustainability achievements include being named Global Healthcare Sector Leader by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) and named to the FTSE4Good Index series, each for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we were named to CDP’s S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the North American region, each for the second consecutive year. For additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives, please visit our website at www.hcpi.com/sustainability.
		
		
			Insurance
		
		
			We obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm, earthquake, environmental and terrorism related losses. We attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles.
		
		
			We maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our medical office, life science and RIDEA facilities. Tenants under triple-net leases, primarily in our senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing and

		hospital segments, are required to provide primary property, business interruption and liability insurance. We maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our RIDEA facilities. Additionally, our corporate general and professional liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned. Under our management agreements with Brookdale, we may elect, on an annual basis, whether we or Brookdale will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable properties, but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties, regardless of who maintains the insurance. 
		
		
			Employees of HCP
		
		
			At December 31, 2014, we had 170 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
		
		
			Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement
		
		
			Overview
		
		
			Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificate of need, government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this report.
		
		
			Based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators, excluding our medical office segment, at December 31, 2014, we estimate that approximately 15% and 14% of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, respectively.
		
		
			The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.
		
		
			Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
		
		
			There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include: (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services; (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions. Many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws, and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.

		Reimbursement 
		
		
			Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare programs and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental third-party payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators. Additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage, Dual Eligible, Accountable Care Organizations (“ACO”), and Bundled Payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
		
		
			Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need
		
		
			Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
		
		
			Life Science Facilities
		
		
			While certain of our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other tenants are less established and, in some cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or other regulatory authorities, for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital, in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance.
		
		
			Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities
		
		
			Certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility’s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters.
		
		
			Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”)
		
		
			Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.
		
		
			Environmental Matters
		
		
			A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore

		could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our earnings. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this report.

			ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors 
		
		
			The section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			As set forth below, we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			risks related to our business and operations;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			risks related to other events; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			risks related to tax, including REIT-related risks.
		
			 
		
		
			Risks Related to Our Business
		
		
			We depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues.
		
		
			During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 40% of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following two companies: HCRMC (26%) and Brookdale (14%). The inability or other failure of these tenants or operators to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay, cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			In addition, any failure by these tenants or operators to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These tenants and operators generally have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and/or insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations.

		Our ownership interest in, and lease with, our largest tenant, HCRMC, accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues. Adverse regulatory or operational developments in HCRMC’s business or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.
		
		
			HCRMC is a provider of a range of healthcare services, primarily in post-acute care, skilled nursing care and assisted living, and our largest tenant representing 31% and 26% of our gross assets and revenues, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014. We also own a 9.4% equity interest in HCRMC, which we acquired together with our April 2011 $6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of HCRMC. In December 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million for our equity ownership interest in HCRMC, primarily resulting from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast and other financial information provided by HCRMC that reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from Medicare to Medicare Advantage, which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay for HCRMC’s skilled nursing segment.
		
		
			Additionally, HCRMC has responded to a Civil Investigative Demand, subpoenas and other requests for information regarding their skilled nursing facilities in connection with an inquiry coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and certain state attorneys general offices.  HCRMC believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. However, since the review is ongoing the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could, among other things, (1) require substantial time and costs to continue to respond to and defend HCRMC’s actions; (2) require HCRMC to refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental programs; (3) require payment of substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions; (4) result in the loss of HCRMC’s right to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs; or (5) cause damage to HCRMC’s reputation.
		
		
			Continued deterioration in HCRMC’s operating performance or other adverse developments in its business, operating and regulatory affairs, or financial condition could reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with HCRMC and/or impair the value of our master lease with HCRMC, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
		
		
			See additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charge, 9.4% equity interest in HCRMC and master lease with HCRMC in: (i) Item 7 “Results of Operations” (post-acute/skilled nursing segment 2014/2013 comparison); and (ii) Note 6 (DFLs), Note 8 (unconsolidated joint ventures) and Note 17 (impairments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
		
		
			The properties managed by Brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income. Adverse developments in Brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us.
		
		
			As of January 1, 2015, Brookdale managed 69 senior housing facilities that we own and 14 CCRCs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to long-term management agreements. These properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and NOI. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on Brookdale’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Brookdale to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.
		
		
			In its capacity as a manager, Brookdale does not lease our properties, and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triple-net tenant. However, any adverse developments in Brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us. Brookdale is also one of our triple-net tenants. If Brookdale experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us.

		The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants or operators may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			We lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we lease to third party tenants who enter into long-term management agreements with operators to manage the properties. Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding. If a debtor were to reject its leases with us, our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In addition, a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited.
		
		
			Also, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. In any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager.  Furthermore, many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide long-term custodial care to the elderly; evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful.
		
		
			Additionally, the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities, credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators,  or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Under certain conditions, defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances, the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences.
		
		
			Increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants and operators and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
		
		
			The healthcare industry is highly competitive. The occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area.  
		
		
			Our tenants and operators also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Such competition, which is due, in part, to historical over development in some segments in which we invest, has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease. We cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further, many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants and operators. Thus, our tenants and operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenues, impairing our assets, and/or increasing our collection and dispute costs.

		Competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio, to finance acquisitions on favorable terms, or to retain or attract tenants and operators.
		
		
			We face significant competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. Similarly, our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market, which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators, or may reduce the rents we are able to charge. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices, finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
		
		
			Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 35% of our revenue was derived from properties located in California (23%) and Texas (12%). As a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased competition or decreased demand, changes in state-specific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters (such as earthquakes, wildfires and hurricanes), which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
		
		
			We may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators.
		
		
			Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property, depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business. If a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent and/or vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators. These expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent completion of development activities once undertaken.
		
		
			Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks that:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate pre-construction leases; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable.

		Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
		
		
			We have and may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, and this could create conflicts of interest and risk to our REIT status;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.
		
			From time to time, we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
		
		
			Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel, and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may encounter difficulties in these integrations. Potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the assumption of unexpected liabilities, including:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.
		
			In addition, the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies, we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions, which may involve the expenditure of significant funds.
		
		
			We regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value. Future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities, the incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures, each of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the

			Table of Contents

		


		financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all.
		
		
			Our tenants and operators may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses.
		
		
			Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Certain losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. For example, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. Companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators, or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future. Also, we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.
		
		
			Our tenants and operators face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs.
		
		
			In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants and operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues. Cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our tenants or operators, for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against, but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part.
		
		
			The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, may adversely affect our operators’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
		
		
			Certain of our tenants and operators are affected by an extremely complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs. Such laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively. See “Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement” above. For example, to the extent that any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			statutory and regulatory changes;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			retroactive rate adjustments;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			court decisions;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			administrative rulings;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			policy interpretations;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities); and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties.

		If our tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Our tenants also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a materially adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants, which, in turn, could have a materially adverse effect on us.
		
		
			In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators’ and tenants’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.
		
		
			Legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
		
		
			Enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 and Congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling, the Affordable Care Act (as defined below), tax reform and entitlement programs, including reimbursement rates for physicians, could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, changes in funding for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as Medicare Advantage Plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers. Additionally, amendments to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), implementation of the Affordable Care Act and decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs. Such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us.
		
		
			Furthermore, the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state Medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade. We can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law, but because of the Supreme Court’s mixed ruling, the implementation will take longer than originally expected, with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare.
		
		
			Tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including licensure, certification and inspection requirements, may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
		
		
			Our tenants and managers are subject to or impacted by extensive, frequently changing federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their operations, such as fire, health and safety laws and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that mandate allowable costs, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the ADA and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the 
		
		 

		

			18

		

 

		

			Table of Contents

		


		Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Certain of our properties may also require a license, registration and/or certificate of need to operate.  
		
		
			Our tenants’ or operators’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action, which may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us, and therefore may materially adversely impact us. See “Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement—Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need” above.
		
		
			Our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.
		
		
			Life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant’s business may be adversely affected or fail;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants’ products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks, including, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws.
		
			If our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully operate, occupy or reposition the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.
		
		
			If a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential. In some cases, the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and, accordingly, we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity. Tenants, operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. Even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all, or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws, either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment.
		
		
			Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities.
		
		
			Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications, including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state

		or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms, or at all, we may take possession of a facility, which might expose us to successor liability, require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses, or spend substantial time and funds to adapt the facility to other uses, all of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Market Conditions
		
		
			Volatility, disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities.
		
		
			The global financial markets have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions. While these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of improvement, the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain. Additional levels of market disruption, volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities.
		
		
			Market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings.
		
		
			We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.
		
		
			We may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. If we are unable to obtain enough internal capital, we may need to rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including but not limited to:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the stability of the market value of our properties;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the United States of its obligations; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			issues facing the healthcare industry, including, but not limited to, healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the performance of the national and global economies generally.
		
			If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations, repay or refinance our debt obligations, fund dividend payments, acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business.

			Table of Contents

		


		Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market price of our securities, including our common stock.
		
		
			Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs, and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on, among other things, our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry.
		
		
			Our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.
		
		
			Our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $9.8 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.
		
		
			Covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility, and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			The terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future, require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements, REIT status and certain levels of debt service coverage. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			An increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets and conduct acquisition, investment and development activities.
		
		
			If interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
		
		
			We manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements. However, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Swap agreements involve risk, including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be

		limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
		
		
			We continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the denominated currency. The ownership of investments located outside of the United States subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the British pound or other currencies in countries where we have a significant investment may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, debt covenant ratios, results of operations and cash flow.
		
		
			We may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods. For example, as of January 30, 2015, we have £492 million in debt investments and maintain an equal amount of unsecured GBP denominated debt as a natural hedge. Additionally, we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments. However, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.
		
		
			 
		
		
			 
		
		
			Risks Related to Other Events
		
		
			We are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders.
		
		
			The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a Maryland corporation. Unless our Board of Directors takes action to exempt us, generally or with respect to certain transactions, from this statute in the future, the Maryland Business Combination Act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons.
		
		
			In addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the Maryland Business Combination Act, our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations. Our charter requires that, except in certain circumstances, “business combinations,” including a merger or consolidation, and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities, with a “related person,” including a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock.
		
		
			The restrictions on business combinations provided under Maryland law and contained in our charter may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.
		
		
			Unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
		
		
			From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs, disruption of our normal business operations and the 
		
		 

		

			22

		

 

		

			Table of Contents

		


		diversion of management attention. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, any pending or future legal action against us.
		
		
			Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us.
		
		
			We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Although our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. The loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock.
		
		
			We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property, lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense.
		
		
			We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we regularly review our insurance coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity. While we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses. These losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property. Following these events, we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. The insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile, and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market.
		
		
			Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate-related investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments.
		
		
			Federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations may require us, as a current or previous owner of real estate, to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property.  We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. The costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination.
		
		
			Although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. As the owner of a site, we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site, including the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us. The cost of defending against these claims, complying with environmental regulatory requirements, conducting remediation of any contaminated property, or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
		
		
			In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use, sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral.

		We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
		
		
			We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attacks have increased. In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
		
		
			Risk Related to Tax, including REIT-Related Risks
		
		
			Loss of our tax status as a REIT would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.
		
		
			Qualification as a REIT involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a REIT. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
		
		
			If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			we will be subject to corporate-level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a REIT.
		
			As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
		
		
			The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with REITs constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the U.S.

		Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us.
		
		
			We could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.
		
		
			If, during the ten-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. There can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur, and these requirements could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.
		
		
			In addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.
		
		
			There are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-REIT tax earnings and profits (“E&P”) in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute E&P.
		
		
			In order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-REIT E&P of certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Failure to make such E&P distributions would result in our disqualification as a REIT. The determination of the amount to be distributed in such E&P distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. We may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the IRS. We currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such E&P distributions. There are, however, substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of E&P, including the possibility that the IRS could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased, which would increase our non-REIT E&P. Moreover, an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated non-REIT E&P, which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing stockholders, if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default, or could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
		
		
			Thus, we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-REIT E&P by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our E&P, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so.
		
		
			Our international expansion may result in additional tax-related risks.
		
		
			We have recently expanded our operations to include the United Kingdom, and may continue to expand internationally. International expansion presents tax-related risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to: 
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not always qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; and 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			challenges of complying with foreign tax rules (including the possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income).
		
			Our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.
		
		
			Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT. Under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.

		Additionally, our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. The ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
