ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe” and “plan.” They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant and a brand customers trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment.  Challenging economic conditions continue to pressure our operating and financial performance.  In particular, in some of our major markets, IEO segments may remain stagnant or experience modest growth, reflecting broad-based consumer caution, price sensitivity, and intensifying competitive activity by both traditional and non-traditional competitors.  Further, certain menu, pricing and promotional decisions may continue to yield results below desired levels and could continue to negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.  As our business model is built around growing comparable sales to realize margin leverage, given these conditions and persistent cost pressures, we expect our results for 2014 will remain challenged. We have the added challenge of the cultural and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory, tax and other initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the sourcing, processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter,” as well as industry marketing practices.These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win and our global growth priorities.The Plan to Win aligns the McDonald's System around the three global growth priorities that represent our greatest opportunities to drive results - optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand in order to remain relevant to our customers. It also keeps us focused on a common approach to execution through our continued emphasis on people, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:▪Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements with us;▪Our continued innovation in all aspects of the McDonald's experience to differentiate the McDonald's experience in a way that balances value with margin levels; ▪The impact of changes to our value menu, which has been and will continue to be an important component of our overall menu strategy; our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations; our ability to adapt our plans to deliver a locally-relevant experience in a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment; our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes across markets; and whether sales gains associated with new product introductions are sustained;▪The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives, especially during periods of underperformance, and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subject to litigation;▪The success of our tiered approach to menu offerings; the impact of pricing, product, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins; and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic and competitive conditions;▪Our ability to drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours, and motivate our restaurant personnel and our franchisees to achieve consistency and high service levels so as to improve perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments;▪Our plans for restaurant reimaging and rebuilding, and whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants and achieve our sales and profitability targets;▪Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our food (including its nutritional content and preparation), promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meal toys (collectively, our "products"), how we source the commodities we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald's of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues;▪The success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food, good people and good neighbor, which will require Systemwide coordination and alignment, including with our franchisees, and whether we will be effective in addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence;▪The costs and risks associated with our increasing reliance on technological and digital systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) that support our Systemwide restaurants; the risk that we will not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience; the potential for system performance failures, security breaches involving our systems or those of third-party providers; legal risks associated with data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide technology-related services to franchisees; and litigation risk involving intellectual property rights;▪The impact of campaigns by labor organizations and activists, including through the use of social media and other mobile communications and applications, to promote adverse  McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report    3perceptions of the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, management, suppliers or franchisees, or to promote or threaten boycotts, strikes or other actions involving the industry, McDonald’s or our suppliers and franchisees;▪The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us or the suppliers, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance has a material impact on our results;▪Our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations and growth; and▪Whether we will be able to develop an effective and compelling global digital strategy in the future that will enhance customer engagement and whether competitor loyalty initiatives will impact our ability to attract customers, particularly as these initiatives become established and customer acquisition costs (i.e., switching costs) increase.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and the prolonged challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results.Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, both globally and in local markets, and conditions can also vary substantially by market. The current global environment has been characterized by persistently weak economies, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets. Many major economies, both advanced and developing, are still facing ongoing economic issues. In the U.S., these include concerns about the long-term direction of federal fiscal policies. In many European markets, consumer and business confidence and spending remain muted. Important markets in Asia have also been experiencing slower growth rates. Uncertainty about the long-term environment could derail any potential improvements in economic activity for 2014.These conditions have pressured our performance, adversely affecting sales, guest counts and/or our market share in many markets, including some major markets.  We are also facing increasing competition from an expanded set of competitors that include many non-traditional market participants such as conventional retailers and coffee shops.  To address this environment, we are intensifying our focus on value as a driver of guest counts through menu, pricing and promotional actions. These actions can adversely affect our margin percent and therefore we expect that margins will remain under pressure. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following:▪Whether our strategies will be effective in enabling market share gains, which have been achieved at declining rates in recent periods, while at the same time enabling us to achieve our targeted operating income growth despite the current adverse economic conditions, resurgent competitors and an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment;▪The effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms;▪The impact on consumer disposable income levels and spending habits of governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers; ▪The impact on restaurant sales and margins of ongoing commodity price volatility, and the effectiveness of pricing, hedging and other actions taken to address this environment;▪The impact on our margins of labor costs that we cannot offset through price increases, and the long-term trend toward higher wages and social expenses in both mature and developing markets, which may intensify with increasing public focus on matters of income inequality;▪The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates on our financial condition and results;▪The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment;▪The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings; and▪The impact of changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:▪The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings;▪The impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans, such as those relating to product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, as well as the risks and costs of our labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given varying legal requirements and practices for testing and disclosure within our industry, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers;▪The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that could be material to our business;▪The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor, employment and personal injury claims, litigation with or involving our relationship with franchisees, landlord/tenant disputes and intellectual property claims (including often aggressive or 4    McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Reportopportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems); the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have;▪Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices;▪The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, energy and water resources, as well as the increased public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters (e.g., packaging and waste, animal health and welfare and land use) and the increased pressure to make commitments or set targets and take actions to meet them, which could expose the Company to market, operational and execution costs or risks, particularly when actions are undertaken Systemwide;▪The increasing focus on workplace practices and conditions and costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including those relating to wage and hour practices, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination, and our exposure to reputational and other harm as a result of perceptions about our workplace practices or conditions or those of our franchisees;▪Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our suppliers' operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit;▪The legal and compliance risks and costs associated with privacy, data protection and similar laws, particularly as they apply to children, the potential costs (including the loss of consumer confidence) arising from alleged security breaches of information systems, and the risk of resulting criminal penalties or civil liability related to such breaches;▪The impact on our operations of tax and other regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs; and▪The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or related authoritative interpretations), particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:▪The continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions;▪Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;▪Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance;▪Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald's may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average;▪The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and▪The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business, legal and tax considerations.Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.ITEM 1B
