ITEM 1A.Risk FactorsThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or our industry or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historic or expected results or cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Over the past few years, the global economy has undergone a period of significant volatility, and the economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of past years. In particular, the risk of a debt default by certain European countries and related European financial structuring efforts or deficit reduction programs instituted by the U.S. government could negatively impact the global economy. This has led, and/or could lead, to reduced consumer and customer spending and/or reduced or eliminated third party payor coverage or reimbursement in the foreseeable future, and this may include spending on health care. While generic drugs present an ideal alternative to higher-priced branded products, our sales could be negatively impacted if patients forego obtaining health care, customers reduce spending or purchases, and/or if third-party payors reduce or eliminate coverage or reimbursement amounts. In addition, reduced consumer and customer spending and/or reduced third party payor coverage or reimbursement, may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices and may reduce the ability of customers to pay their obligations. These conditions may have a material adverse effect on our industry, business, financial position and results of operations and may cause the market value of our common stock to decline.21Table of ContentsOUR INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INVOLVES A NUMBER OF RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.There are a number of operational risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, cost savings, revenue synergies and growth opportunities; difficulties in consolidating information technology platforms, business applications and corporate infrastructure; our substantial indebtedness and assumed liabilities; challenges associated with operating in new markets; and the unanticipated effects of export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions or domestic and foreign economic conditions.These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete, require us to focus additional resources on integration of operations rather than other profitable areas, or otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.WE HAVE GROWN AT A VERY RAPID PACE. OUR INABILITY TO PROPERLY MANAGE OR SUPPORT THIS GROWTH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We have grown very rapidly over the past few years, through our acquisitions of the former Merck Generics business, the former Matrix Laboratories Limited, Bioniche Pharma and the Respiratory Delivery Platform. This growth has put significant demands on our processes, systems and people. We expect to make further investments in additional personnel, systems and internal control processes to help manage our growth. Attracting, retaining and motivating key employees in various departments and locations to support our growth are critical to our business, and competition for these people can be intense. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees and if we do not continue to invest in systems and processes to manage and support our rapid growth, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and the market value of our common stock could decline.OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Our operations extend to numerous countries outside the U.S., and operating globally exposes us to certain additional risks including, but not limited to:•compliance with a variety of national and local laws of countries in which we do business, including restrictions on the import and export of certain intermediates, drugs and technologies;•compliance with a variety of U.S. laws including, but not limited to, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012;•changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the health care system, including but not limited to imports, exports, manufacturing, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of health care;•fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions conducted in currencies other than the functional currency;•adverse changes in the economies in which we operate as a result of a slowdown in overall growth, a change in government or economic liberalization policies, or financial, political or social instability in such countries that affects the markets in which we operate, particularly emerging markets;•wage increases or rising inflation in the countries in which we operate;•supply disruptions, and increases in energy and transportation costs;•natural disasters, including droughts, floods and earthquakes in the countries in which we operate;•communal disturbances, terrorist attacks, riots or regional hostilities in the countries in which we operate; and•government uncertainty, including as a result of new or changed laws and regulations.We also face the risk that some of our competitors have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally. Furthermore, whether due to language, cultural or other differences, statements we make may be misinterpreted, misconstrued or taken out of context. Finally, the internal political stability of, or the relationship 22Table of Contentsbetween, any country or countries where we conduct business operations may deteriorate. Changes in a country’s political stability or the state of relations between any such countries are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our future operations. Any such changes could lead to a decline in our profitability. Any meaningful deterioration of the political stability in and/or diplomatic relations between any countries in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS LOCATED IN INDIA AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES IN INDIA. THESE UNCERTAINTIES CREATE RISKS WHICH COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.In recent years, Mylan’s Indian subsidiary, Mylan Laboratories Limited, has benefited from many policies of the Government of India and the Indian state governments in the states in which it operates, which are designed to promote foreign investment generally, including significant tax incentives, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. There is no assurance that such policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current federal government, could trigger significant changes in India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular.In addition, our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In particular, India has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years, but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to health care and education. Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees and develop and operate our manufacturing facilities in India could be adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these challenges.Southern Asia has, from time to time, experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries, including India and Pakistan, and within the countries themselves. Rioting, military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could influence the Indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel and the conduct of our business more difficult. Resulting political tensions could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Indian operations involve a high degree of risk, and that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by companies with Indian operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the market for Mylan Laboratories Limited’s products. Furthermore, if India were to become engaged in armed hostilities, particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons, Mylan Laboratories Limited might not be able to continue its operations. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts and wars. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.A significant portion of our revenues, indebtedness and other liabilities and our costs are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, the Australian Dollar, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Indian Rupee and the Japanese Yen. We report our financial results in U.S. Dollars. Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by certain movements in exchange rates. In particular, the risk of a debt default by certain European countries and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause volatility in the value of the Euro. From time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR WORLDWIDE ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS, WHICH IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS AND MAY CARRY SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ANY VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS, OR ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH VIOLATIONS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.23Table of ContentsThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND/OR LICENSE, OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS IN RELATION TO OUR COMPETITORS’ PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. OUR FAILURE TO DO SO SUCCESSFULLY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Our future revenues and profitability will depend, to an extent, upon our ability to successfully develop and/or license, or otherwise acquire and commercialize, new generic and patent or statutorily protected pharmaceutical products in a timely manner. Product development is inherently risky, especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established and the market is not yet proven. Likewise, product licensing involves inherent risks including uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to the supply of product meeting specifications and terms such as license scope or termination rights. The development and commercialization process, particularly with regard to new drugs, also requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. We, or a partner, may not be successful in commercializing any of such products on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.Before any prescription drug product, including generic drug products, can be marketed, marketing authorization approval is required by the relevant regulatory authorities and/or national regulatory agencies (for example the FDA in the U.S. and the EMA in the EU). The process of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market new and generic pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly and largely unpredictable. Outside the U.S., the approval process may be more or less rigorous, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S. Bioequivalence studies conducted in one country may not be accepted in other countries, and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not necessarily mean that the product will be approved in another country. We, or a partner, may be unable to obtain requisite approvals on a timely basis for new generic or branded products that we may develop, license or otherwise acquire. Moreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the indicated uses and delivery methods for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for the drug. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in efficacy and bioequivalence testing, as well as in anticipation of the product’s launch. In the event that regulatory approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete. The timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect our product introduction plans, business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.The approval process for generic pharmaceutical products often results in the relevant regulatory agency granting final approval to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the time a patent claim for a corresponding branded product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market. Additionally, further generic approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices, as well as reduced margins, for generic products compared to branded products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price and margin erosion over the generic product life cycle.In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for each abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to a reference drug product, commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. During this exclusivity period, which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared with other applicable ANDA sponsors with Paragraph IV certifications, the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors holding applications for the same generic equivalent. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is successful and the applicant is awarded exclusivity, the applicant generally enjoys higher market share, net revenues and gross margin for that product. However, our ability to obtain 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity may be dependent upon our ability to obtain FDA approval or tentative approval 24Table of Contentswithin 30 months of the FDA’s acceptance of our ANDA. If we are unable to obtain approval or tentative approval within that time period, we may risk forfeiture of such marketing exclusivity. Even if we obtain FDA approval for our generic drug products, if we are not the first ANDA applicant to challenge a listed patent for such a product, we may lose significant advantages to a competitor that filed its ANDA containing such a challenge. The same would be true in situations where we are required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA sponsors with Paragraph IV certifications. Such situations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market that product profitably and on our business, financial position and results of operations, and the market value of our common stock could decline.In Europe, there is no exclusivity period for the first generic. The EMA or national regulatory agencies may grant marketing authorizations to any number of generics. However, if there are other patents which the brand alleges are relevant, for example, new formulations, the owner of the original brand pharmaceutical may be able to obtain a preliminary injunction in certain European jurisdictions delaying launch of the generic product, depending on local court practices and/or the relevance of the asserted patents.In addition, in other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we may face similar regulatory hurdles and constraints. If we are unable to navigate our products through all of the regulatory hurdles we face in a timely manner it could adversely affect our product introduction plans, business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT MAY NOT LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.Much of our development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology, including our generic biologics program and respiratory platform. We conduct research and development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market approved pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable regulations. We also partner with third parties to develop products. Typically, research expenses related to the development of innovative compounds and the filing of marketing authorization applications for innovative compounds (such as NDAs in the U.S.) are significantly greater than those expenses associated with the development of and filing of marketing authorization applications for generic products (such as ANDAs in the U.S. and abridged applications in Europe). As we and our partners continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in our industry, particularly with respect to new drugs, our, or a partner’s, research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of new pharmaceutical products approved by the relevant regulatory bodies. Also, after we submit a marketing authorization application for a new compound or generic product, the relevant regulatory authority may change standards and/or request that we conduct additional studies and, as a result, we may incur total research and development costs to develop a particular product in excess of what we anticipated. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new products as a result of those efforts, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline.OUR APPROVED PRODUCTS MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED LEVELS OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new pharmaceutical products, generic or branded, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be impacted by several factors, including but not limited to:•the availability of alternative products from our competitors;•the price of our products relative to that of our competitors;•the timing of our market entry;•the ability to market our products effectively to the retail level; and•the acceptance of our products by government and private formularies.25Table of ContentsSome of these factors are not within our control. Additionally, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others. Such studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs such as the need for a patient registry. These situations, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, business, financial position and results of operations, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF US, OUR BRANDS AND THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS. OUR BUSINESS OR BRANDS COULD BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Market perceptions of our business are very important to us, especially market perceptions of our brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, or our brands, suffer from negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. Also, because we are dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.THE ILLEGAL DISTRIBUTION AND SALE BY THIRD PARTIES OF COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OF STOLEN PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.The drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimates that more than 10% of medications being sold globally are counterfeit.Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be potentially life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the API or no API at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.Public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.IF WE OR ANY PARTNER FAIL TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, THEN WE COULD LOSE REVENUE UNDER OUR LICENSING AGREEMENTS OR LOSE SALES TO GENERIC COPIES OF OUR BRANDED PRODUCTS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Our success, particularly in our specialty business, depends in part on our or any partner’s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, and protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. Our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third-parties from developing substantially equivalent products. In the absence of patent and trade secret protection, competitors may adversely affect our branded products business by independently developing and marketing 26Table of Contentssubstantially equivalent products. It is also possible that we could incur substantial costs if we are required to initiate litigation against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.We have filed patent applications covering composition of, methods of making, and/or methods of using, our branded products and branded product candidates. We may not be issued patents based on patent applications already filed or that we file in the future, and if patents are issued, they may be insufficient in scope to cover our branded products. The issuance of a patent in one country does not ensure the issuance of a patent in any other country. Furthermore, the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions and has been and remains the subject of much litigation. Legal standards relating to scope and validity of patent claims are evolving and may differ in various countries. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any other governmental agency may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, or invalidation or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COLLABORATION PARTNERS. SUCH NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We have entered into strategic alliances with partners to develop, manufacture or distribute certain products in various markets. The Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to these various collaborations. There is a risk that the investments made by the Company in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns. While we believe our relationships with our partners have been good, disputes or conflicting priorities could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefits of the collaboration. A failure or inability of our partners to perform their collaboration obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.WE FACE VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS THAT THREATENS THE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.The generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from many U.S. and foreign manufacturers, some of whom are significantly larger than we are. Our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons, including but not limited to the possibility that they may have:•proprietary processes or delivery systems;•larger research and development and marketing staffs;•larger production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area;•more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;•more products; or•more experience in developing new drugs and greater financial resources, particularly with regard to manufacturers of branded products.Any of these factors and others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.THE USE OF LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE STRATEGIES BY COMPETITORS, BOTH BRAND AND GENERIC, INCLUDING “AUTHORIZED GENERICS” AND CITIZEN’S PETITIONS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION, MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OR MARKETING OF OUR GENERIC PRODUCTS, COULD DELAY OR PREVENT SUCH INTRODUCTION AND/OR COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR PROFIT POTENTIAL. THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.27Table of ContentsOur competitors, both branded and generic, often pursue strategies to prevent or delay competition from generic alternatives to branded products. These strategies include, but are not limited to:•entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an authorized generic, a generic equivalent of a branded product, at the same time generic competition initially enters the market;•launching a generic version of their own branded product at the same time generic competition initially enters the market;•filing citizen’s petitions with the FDA or other regulatory bodies, including timing the filings so as to thwart generic competition by causing delays of our product approvals;•seeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult to demonstrate bioequivalence;•initiating legislative efforts to limit the substitution of generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals;•filing suits for patent infringement that may delay regulatory approval of many generic products;•introducing “next-generation” products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product, which often materially reduces the demand for the first generic product for which we seek regulatory approval;•obtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of brand drugs in pediatric populations or by other potential methods;•persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brand name drugs for which the patents are about to expire, thus allowing the brand name company to obtain new patented products serving as substitutes for the products withdrawn; and•seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire.In the U.S., some companies have lobbied Congress for amendments to the Hatch-Waxman legislation that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors. For example, although the term of a company’s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time an NDA is under regulatory review, some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the one-half year that is currently permitted.If proposals like these in the U.S., Europe or in other countries where we operate were to become effective, our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed, reduced or eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, MAY ALLEGE THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, FORCING US TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN RESULTING LITIGATION, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS UNCERTAIN. ANY UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME OF SUCH LITIGATION, INCLUDING IN AN “AT-RISK LAUNCH” SITUATION, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Companies that produce brand pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products. These companies allege patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the basis for filing suit against an ANDA or similar applicant. Likewise, patent holders may bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling their approved generic products. Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If patents are held valid and infringed by our products in a particular jurisdiction, we would, unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder, need to cease selling in that jurisdiction and may need to deliver up or destroy existing stock in that jurisdiction.There may also be situations where we use our business judgment and decide to market and sell products, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) have not been finally resolved by the courts (i.e., an “at-risk launch”). The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner and not necessarily by the profits earned by the infringer. In the case of a willful infringement, the definition of which is subjective, such damages may be increased up to three times. Moreover, because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent products, patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than bioequivalent products. An adverse 28Table of Contentsdecision in a case such as this or in other similar litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR SPECIALTY BUSINESS DEVELOPS, FORMULATES, MANUFACTURES OR IN-LICENSES AND MARKETS BRANDED PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Our branded products developed, formulated, manufactured (or alternatively, in-licensed) and marketed by our specialty business may be subject to the following risks, among others:•limited patent life, or the loss of patent protection;•competition from generic or similar branded products;•reductions in reimbursement rates by third-party payors;•importation by consumers;•product liability;•drug development risks arising from typically greater research and development investments than generics; and•unpredictability with regard to establishing a market.In addition, developing and commercializing branded products is generally more costly than generic products. If such business expenditures do not ultimately result in the launch of commercially successful brand products, or if any of the risks above were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and the market value of our common stock could decline.A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRODUCTS MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, GROSS PROFIT OR NET EARNINGS FROM TIME TO TIME. IF THE VOLUME OR PRICING OF ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS DECLINES, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Sales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit and net earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, our top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 28% and 23%, respectively, of our consolidated total revenues. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline.A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. ANY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF BUSINESS WITH ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales to a limited number of customers. If we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of business with one such customer, or if one such customer were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline.During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, sales to Cardinal Health, Inc. were approximately 14%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, and sales to McKesson Corporation were approximately 13%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues.WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN THE SALES VOLUME AND PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS THE RESULT OF THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER GROUPS, SUCH AS THE WHOLESALE DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL PHARMACY INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCE OF LARGE BUYING GROUPS. THE RESULT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.29Table of ContentsA significant amount of our sales are to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of generic pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. This consolidation may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions potentially enable those groups to attempt to extract price discounts on our products. The result of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE RAW MATERIALS, PARTICULARLY THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND(S) COMPRISING THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, THAT WE USE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FINISHED GOODS. AN INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We typically purchase the active pharmaceutical ingredient (i.e., the chemical compounds that produce the desired therapeutic effect in our products) and other materials and supplies that we use in our manufacturing operations, as well as certain finished products, from many different foreign and domestic suppliers.Additionally, we maintain safety stocks in our raw materials inventory and, in certain cases where we have listed only one supplier in our applications with regulatory agencies, have received regulatory agency approval to use alternative suppliers should the need arise. However, there is no guarantee that we will always have timely and sufficient access to a critical raw material or finished product. An interruption in the supply of a single-sourced raw material, including the active ingredient, or finished product could cause our business, financial position and results of operations to be materially adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline. In addition, our manufacturing capabilities could be impacted by quality deficiencies in the products which our suppliers provide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and the market value of our common stock could decline.We utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the DEA in the U.S. as well as similar laws in other countries where we operate. These laws relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our current products and products in development and, as a result, our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. We must annually apply to the DEA and other regulatory agencies for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA or such regulatory agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND CERTAIN THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS PRODUCING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. PRODUCTION AT ANY ONE OF THESE FACILITIES COULD BE INTERRUPTED, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE FACILITY, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.A substantial portion of our capacity as well as our current production is attributable to a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain third party suppliers. A significant disruption at any one of such facilities within our internal or third party supply chain, even on a short-term basis, whether due to a labor strike, failure to reach acceptable agreement with labor and unions, adverse quality or compliance observation, act of God, civil or political unrest, or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could, among other consequences, subject us to exposure to claims from customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.BECAUSE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS HEAVILY REGULATED, WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. SHOULD WE FAIL TO COMPLY, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, 30Table of ContentsFINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.The pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with requirements of the FDA and similar requirements of similar agencies in our other markets with respect to the research, development, manufacture, quality, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, promotion and development of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with regulations of the FDA and other regulators could result in fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, rejection or delay in approval of applications, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, our inability to sell products, the return by customers of our products, suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the regulators may also have the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Although we have internal regulatory compliance programs and policies and have had a favorable compliance history, in all material respects, there is no guarantee that these programs, as currently designed, will meet regulatory agency standards in the future. Additionally, despite our efforts at compliance, from time to time we receive notices of observations of FDA inspections as well as official agency correspondence regarding compliance.  There is also no guarantee that we may not be deemed to be deficient in some manner in the future. If we were deemed to be deficient in any significant way, or if any of the noted risks occur, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially affected and the market value of our common stock could decline.In Europe we must also comply with regulatory requirements with respect to the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, promotion and development of pharmaceutical products. Some of these requirements are contained in EU regulations and governed by the EMA. Other requirements are set down in national laws and regulations of the EU Member States. Failure to comply with the regulations can result in a range of fines, penalties, product recalls/suspensions or even criminal liability. Similar laws and regulations exist in most of the markets in which we operate.In addition to the new drug approval process, government agencies also regulate the facilities and operational procedures that we use to manufacture our products. We must register our facilities with the FDA and other similar regulators. Products manufactured in our facilities must be made in a manner consistent with current good manufacturing practices or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture. Compliance with such regulations requires substantial expenditures of time, money and effort in such areas as production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. The FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities for compliance. Regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific. Failure to comply with good manufacturing practices and other regulatory standards at one of our manufacturing facilities could result in an enforcement action brought by the FDA or other regulatory bodies which could include withholding or withdrawing the approval of our submissions or other product applications of that facility, discontinuation of manufacture, recalls, or other adverse actions. If any regulatory body were to withhold or withdraw approval of an application, or require a recall or other adverse product action, or require one of our manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected. Delay and cost in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.We also must comply with data protection and data privacy requirements in many countries.  Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, security and protection of employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for the Company, as well as significant fines, penalties and damage to our global reputation and our brand as a result of non-compliance.We are subject, as are generally all manufacturers, to various federal, state and local laws regulating working conditions, as well as environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of materials into the environment and those related to climate change. Although we have not incurred significant costs associated with complying with such environmental provisions in the past, if changes to such environmental laws and regulations are made in the future that require significant changes in our operations or if we engage in the development and manufacturing of new products requiring new or different environmental or other controls, or if we are found to have violated any applicable rules, we may be required to expend significant funds. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.OUR REPORTING AND PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICARE AND/OR MEDICAID REBATE PROGRAM AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASING AND REBATE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLEX AND MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS THAT COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF NEW BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATORY GUIDANCE, OR ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY DETERMINATION OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE OBLIGATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS 31Table of ContentsWHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement and rebates and other governmental programs are complex. Because our processes for these calculations and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve, and will continue to involve, subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in material changes. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) of 2010 includes a provision requiring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to publish a weighted average Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) for all multi-source drugs. The provision was effective October 1, 2010; however, weighted average AMP’s have not yet been published by CMS, except in draft form, and have not been implemented for use in the calculation of Federal Upper Limits (“FULs”). Although the weighted average AMP would not reveal Mylan’s individual AMP, publishing a weighted average AMP available to customers and the public at large could negatively affect our leverage in commercial price negotiations.In addition, as also disclosed herein, a number of state and federal government agencies are conducting investigations of manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to Average Wholesale Prices (“AWP”) in which they have suggested that reporting of inflated AWP has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs. We and numerous other pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in various actions relating to pharmaceutical pricing issues and whether allegedly improper actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers led to excessive payments by Medicare and/or Medicaid.Any governmental agencies that have commenced, or may commence, an investigation of Mylan relating to the sales, marketing, pricing, quality, or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose, based on a claim of violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs including Medicare and/or Medicaid. Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments — and even in the absence of any such ambiguity — a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions. Any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE MAY EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, HMOS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF TENDER SYSTEMS COULD REDUCE PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR REDUCE OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. ANY SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Various governmental authorities (including the U.K. National Health Service and the German statutory health insurance scheme) and private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) in the U.S., provide reimbursements or subsidies to consumers for the cost of certain pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In the U.S., third-party payors increasingly challenge the pricing of pharmaceutical products. This trend and other trends toward the growth of HMOs, managed health care and legislative health care reform create significant uncertainties regarding the future levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. Further, any reimbursement may be reduced in the future, perhaps to the point that market demand for our products declines. Such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.In addition, a number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive a preferential reimbursement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender.Certain other countries may consider the implementation of a tender system. Even if a tender system is ultimately not implemented, the anticipation of such could result in price reductions. Failing to win tenders, or the implementation of similar systems in other markets leading to further price declines, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.32Table of ContentsLEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT MAY INFLUENCE PRICES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Current or future federal, state or foreign laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. For example, programs in existence in certain states in the U.S. seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular state Medicare and/or Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicare and/or Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the prices we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.In order to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of products and, in some cases, limit the range of different forms of pharmaceuticals available for prescription by national health services. These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.Several countries in which we operate have implemented, or plan to implement, government mandated price reductions. When such price cuts occur, pharmaceutical companies have generally experienced significant declines in revenues and profitability and uncertainties continue to exist within the market. Such price reductions could have an adverse effect on our business, and as uncertainties are resolved or if other countries in which we operate enact similar measures, they could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.In recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for health care services in the U.S., and it is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on health care reform in the future. The PPACA and The Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which amends the PPACA (collectively the “Health Reform Laws”), were signed into law in March 2010. While the Health Reform Laws may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products, they also include provisions such as the assessment of a pharmaceutical manufacturer fee and an increase in the amount of rebates that manufacturers pay for coverage of their drugs by Medicaid programs.We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation. The Health Reform Laws and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.Additionally, we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In the EU and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. This international system of price regulations may lead to inconsistent prices. Within the EU and in other countries, the availability of our products in some markets at lower prices undermines our sales in some markets with higher prices. Additionally, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, and may create the opportunity for third party cross border trade.If significant additional reforms are made to the U.S. health care system, or to the health care systems of other markets in which we operate, those reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR INQUIRIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.33Table of ContentsWe are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries, including, but not limited to, patent infringement, product liability, antitrust matters, breach of contract and claims involving Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursements, or laws relating to sales and marketing practices, some of which are described in our periodic reports, that involve claims for, or the possibility of fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties and exclusion from participation in various government health-care-related programs. If any of these legal proceedings or inquiries were to result in an adverse outcome, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.With respect to product liability, we maintain a combination of self-insurance (including through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary) and commercial insurance to protect against and manage a portion of the risks involved in conducting our business. Although we carry insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceuticals for human consumption. To the extent that a loss occurs, depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.In addition, in limited circumstances, entities we acquired in the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business are party to litigation in matters under which we are entitled to indemnification by Merck KGaA. However, there are risks inherent in such indemnities and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will receive the full benefits of such indemnification, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.IF THE INTERCOMPANY TERMS OF CROSS BORDER ARRANGEMENTS WE HAVE AMONG OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE DETERMINED TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, OUR TAX LIABILITY MAY INCREASE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations which include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery functions. Although we believe our cross border arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country, which may result in increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause our tax expense to increase. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN OUR TAX PROVISIONS OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Additionally, changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS AND TAX RULINGS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Potential changes to income tax laws in the United States include measures which would defer the deduction of interest expense related to deferred income; determine the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis; tax currently excess returns 34Table of Contentsassociated with transfers of intangibles offshore; and limit earnings stripping by expatriated entities. In addition, proposals were made to encourage manufacturing in the U.S., including reduced rates of tax and increased deductions related to manufacturing. We cannot determine whether these proposals will be modified or enacted, whether other proposals unknown at this time will be made or the extent to which the corporate tax rate might be reduced and ameliorate the adverse impact of some of these proposals. If enacted, and depending on its precise terms, such legislation could materially increase our overall effective income tax rate and income tax expense. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE MAY DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH, AND WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We may from time to time consider selling certain assets if (a) we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy, or (b) we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various reasons including we want to reduce indebtedness. We have explored and will continue to explore the sale of certain non-core assets. Although our intention is to engage in asset sales only if they advance our overall strategy, any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and opportunities for growth, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INDEBTEDNESS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY EFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSTION AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH INDEBTEDNESS. ANY REFINANCING OF THIS DEBT COULD BE AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs;•increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in general because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt.Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including interest rates and general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness, borrow more money or sell securities, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our Senior Credit Agreement and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, this is subject to certain limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire.In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks described above could intensify. If global credit markets return to their recent levels of contraction, future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms, and as a result we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.35Table of ContentsOur credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, securitization facility, other outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay certain dividends, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with our affiliates or restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, merge or consolidate. In addition, our Senior Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. We cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS RELATED TO OUR OUTSTANDING CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2015 (THE “CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES”) WILL INCREASE IF OUR STOCK PRICE INCREASES. ALSO, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO NOTE HEDGES AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN ORDER TO HEDGE SOME OF THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL INCREASE OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SETTLEMENT VALUE.  SUCH TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, MAINLY HIGHLY RATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ANY INCREASE IN INDEBTEDNESS, NET EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE RISK OR FAILURE OF ANY COUNTERPARTIES TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON US, INCLUDING UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Under applicable accounting rules, the cash conversion feature that is a term of the Cash Convertible Notes must be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet and periodically marked to fair value. If our stock price increases, the liability associated with the cash conversion feature would increase and, because this liability must be periodically marked to fair value on our balance sheet, the total amount of indebtedness related to the notes that is shown on our balance sheet would also increase. This could have adverse effects on us, including under any future debt agreements that contain covenants based on a definition of total indebtedness as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). As a result, we may not be able to comply with such covenants in the future, which could, among other things, restrict our ability to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of the notes and our common stock to decline.In connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge and warrant transactions with certain financial institutions, each of which we refer to as a counterparty. The Cash Convertible Note hedge is comprised of purchased cash-settled call options that are expected to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments required to be made by us upon the cash conversion of the notes. We have also entered into respective warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we will have sold to each counterparty warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock. Together, each of the note hedges and warrant transactions are expected to provide us with some protection against increases in our stock price over the conversion price per share. However, there is no assurance that these transactions will remain in effect at all times. Also, although we believe the counterparties are highly rated financial institutions, there are no assurances that the counterparties will be able to perform their respective obligations under the agreement we have with each of them. Any net exposure related to conversion of the notes or any failure of the counterparties to perform their obligations under the agreements we have with them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES WOULD INVOLVE A NUMBER OF INHERENT RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We may continue to seek to expand our product line through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other companies, products or assets, including those in rapidly developing economies, or through joint ventures, licensing agreements or other arrangements or may determine to divest certain products or assets. Any such acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations may involve significant challenges in integrating the new company’s operations, and divestitures could be equally challenging. Either process may prove to be complex and time consuming and require substantial resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings.36Table of ContentsWe may be unable to realize synergies or other benefits, including tax savings, expected to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other transactions or investments we may undertake, or be unable to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits. Realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions could take longer than expected, and implementation difficulties, unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, market factors or deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions could alter the anticipated benefits of any such transactions. We may also compete for certain acquisition targets with companies having greater financial resources than us or other advantages over us that may prevent us from acquiring a target. We also may inherit legal, regulatory and other risks that accrued prior to the acquisition, whether known or unknown to us. These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete, require us to focus additional resources on integration of operations rather than other profitable areas, or otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH PERIODICALLY INCORPORATE PROVISIONS WHEREBY WE INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into employment, legal settlement, and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. We maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under certain of these indemnification provisions. However, should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed our coverage or should coverage be denied, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the market value of our common stock could decline.OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. ANY FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.It is important that we attract and retain qualified personnel in order to develop new products and compete effectively. If we fail to attract and retain key scientific, technical or management personnel, our business could be affected adversely. Additionally, while we have employment agreements with certain key employees in place, their employment for the duration of the agreement is not guaranteed. If we are unsuccessful in retaining our key employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING AND FURTHER DEVELOPING OUR GLOBAL ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. AS WITH ANY ENHANCEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS, DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED COULD RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We are enhancing and further developing our global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and associated applications to provide more operating efficiencies and effective management of our business operations. Such changes to ERP systems and related software carry risks such as cost overruns, project delays and business interruptions and delays. If we experience a material business interruption as a result of our ERP enhancements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FACE CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY AND DATA LEAKAGE RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested heavily in the protection of 37Table of Contentsour data and information technology to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches.  If we experience such a breach or breakdown, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. THE EXPANSION OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PRESENT NEW RISKS AND CHALLENGES. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.The inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation. Further, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and protect information. If our non-public sensitive information is disclosed or if our reputation is seriously damaged through social media, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.WE MUST MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND BE ABLE, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, TO PROVIDE AN ASSERTION AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CONTROLS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS OR TO IMPLEMENT NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Effective internal controls are necessary for Mylan to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports. We are spending a substantial amount of management time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. In the U.S., such regulations include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, SEC regulations and the NASDAQ listing standards. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation as to the effectiveness of these controls by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and the market value of our common stock could decline.THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ANY FUTURE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED OR NECESSARY REVISIONS TO PRIOR ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS OR CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD LEAD TO A RESTATEMENT OR REVISION TO PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.The Consolidated and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement. Furthermore, although we have recorded reserves for litigation related contingencies based on estimates of probable future costs, such litigation related contingencies could result in substantial further costs. Also, any new or revised accounting standards may require adjustments to previously issued financial statements. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.38Table of ContentsCHARGES TO EARNINGS RESULTING FROM ACQUISITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.Under the GAAP business combination accounting standards, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows:•costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;•impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development;•amortization of intangible assets acquired;•a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;•identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, contingent purchase price consideration, income tax contingencies and other non-income tax contingencies, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;•charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-acquisition activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;•charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and•changes to contingent consideration liabilities, including accretion and fair value adjustments.A significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of the common stock to decline.ITEM 1B
