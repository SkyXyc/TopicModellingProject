Item 1A: Risk Factors.”  Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of those risks as you read this report.3Table of ContentsPART I ITEM 1.  OUR BUSINESSAlaska Air Group operates Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, which together with its partner regional airlines, serve 95 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico.  During 2012, we carried 26 million passengers while earning record full-year adjusted earnings of $339 million.Our objective is to be one of the most respected domestic airlines by our customers, employees, and shareholders.  We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with customers by providing exceptional customer service, and maintain a competitive cost structure to increase our profitability, provide low fares and grow our network.  Over the past decade, we have worked to transform our company to achieve these objectives.  In 2012, Alaska Airlines ranked “Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers” by J.D. Power and Associates for the fifth year in a row.  For the ninth consecutive year, we have reported an adjusted annual profit, allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve an after-tax return on invested capital of 13% in 2012, surpassing our 10% goal for the third year in a row.  In addition, over the past decade, we have diversified our network to better respond to the seasonality in our business and provide more destinations for our customers.  As we look to the future, we will build on the success of the past few years by executing our strategic plan — the Five Focus Areas:Safety and ComplianceWe have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation, and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives.  Alaska and Horizon, in coordination with the FAA, began implementing a Safety Management System to better identify and manage risk.  Both airlines achieved Level One certification in 2012 and plan to achieve Level Two certification in 2013.  People FocusWhile aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation, we recognize this is fundamentally a people business and our success depends on our employees.  Strengthening our "small company feel" will allow our employees to execute as a united team on the frontlines and behind the scenes.  All Air Group employees have attended or will soon attend our Flight Path program, a one-day workshop to share the future vision for our company.  In addition, all employees participate in the Performance-Based Pay (PBP) and Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) programs, which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety, profitability, low costs and customer satisfaction.  Over the last four years, our incentive programs have paid out over $325 million.Hassle-Free Customer ExperienceWe want to be the easiest airline to fly, which we will do by improving each step of the customer's journey from booking a ticket to our in-flight experience.  During 2012, we launched a new mobile website, m.alaskaair.com, which provides customers quick and easy access to important travel information from any handheld mobile device or tablet, including the ability to purchase tickets, track flight details, check-in, get mobile boarding passes, and view optional upgrades.  After the successful launch of booking on our mobile website, we upgraded our Android app in December 2012 and iPhone app in January 2013 to allow our customers to book tickets using our apps.  We introduced self-bag tagging to four locations in 2012, which allows customers to print and attach their own luggage tags from a self-service kiosk in the airport lobby or, as part of a pilot program, at home during web check-in.  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) launched their Pre-Check Program in 17 of our locations, which allows eligible customers to opt-in for reduced screening requirements.   As passengers take more control of their travel experience, we are able to reduce the time it takes a customer to move from the airport curb to the aircraft.We have also made improvements to our airport gate areas.  At Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Alaska moved to a newly renovated Terminal 6, which includes our Airport of the Future design, new common use systems, additional gates, and convenient connections with international flights.  At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac), the Port of Seattle Commission gave final design authorization to renovate the North Satellite to better serve passengers and consolidate our operations.  The project will include modernizing facilities, enhanced traveler amenities, adding three gates, and building a new roof-top Boardroom.  We also enhanced the customer experience by adding more power outlets to gate areas at six airport locations.  We expect construction on this project to commence in late 2013.We continued to improve our in-flight experience by taking delivery of our first B737 aircraft with the Boeing Sky Interior.  The interior includes variable ambient cabin lighting, larger window recesses, and overhead bins which provide more headroom, all designed to offer a greater sense of space.  All future B737 aircraft deliveries will include the Boeing Sky Interior.4Table of ContentsEnergetic and Compelling BrandWe are fortunate to have high brand awareness and customer loyalty in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  For us to keep growing in new markets like California, Hawaii and cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S., we believe we must better understand what is important to our new customers, and position our brand appropriately to help differentiate us from the competition.  We use our brand and technology to develop more direct relationships with our customers through more personalized marketing.  Our website, alaskaair.com, is tailored to each customer based on their location and viewing history.  In 2012, approximately 54% of our ticket sales were made through alaskaair.com and our goal is 60% in 2013.  Similarly, our email marketing is highly targeted and personalized by allowing customers to choose which types of messages they want to receive, such as fare sale, new markets, offers from partner airlines and monthly Mileage Plan activity.  As a result, we increase ticket sales and reduce our ticket distribution costs by providing the right marketing messages to the right people at the right time.We use social platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to give customers a new way to connect with our brand and provide exceptional customer service throughout their journey.  In 2012, our Facebook fans grew by 47% and our Twitter followers increased 38%.  And as we expand our network, we are dedicated to becoming part of the communities we serve.  In 2012, employees participated in over 235 community events, including the "Spirit of the Islands" paint-the-plane contest with the winning artwork adorning one of our B737-800 aircraft.  We also sponsor a number of local teams in the cities we serve, such as the Seattle Mariners and Portland Timbers.Low Fares, Low Costs and Network GrowthIn order to profitably provide low fares to our customers while returning value to our shareholders, we believe we must maintain a competitive cost structure.  In 2012, we lowered our unit costs, excluding fuel, by 0.8% on a consolidated basis, representing the 10th such annual reduction out of the past 11 years.  We achieved this through a continued focus on productivity.  In 2012, we increased employee productivity by 3.5% and will continue to focus on that metric through several tools as we leverage growth.  We also continue to reduce fuel costs by flying fuel-efficient aircraft, which have reduced our fuel burn as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 13.4% over the last five years, and by decreasing our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices through our fuel hedge program.  Looking forward, we have committed to purchasing 34 737-900ER and 37 737 MAX aircraft, with deliveries in 2013 to 2022, to position us for growth and ensure we will continue to operate the quietest and most fuel-efficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future.In 2012, we added 21 new markets to our network and exited six as we continued to better match supply with demand.  We diversified our network further to offer more utility to our customers by adding flights to Hawaii and expanding to cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S., such as Kansas City, San Antonio, and Philadelphia.  We will also add new routes from Seattle to Salt Lake City and San Diego to Boston and Lihue in 2013.  AIR GROUPAlaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.  Although Alaska and Horizon both operate as airlines, their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially.  Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937.  Horizon Air Industries is a Washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981.  Horizon was acquired by Air Group in 1986.  Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights.  Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement.We attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in a way that best optimizes our revenues and profitability, reduces our seasonality, and takes advantage of demand in areas where other carriers have either exited or don't have the ability to serve.5Table of ContentsThe percentage of our capacity by market is as follows: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008West Coast35% 37% 41% 45% 48%Alaska17% 18% 19% 20% 20%Transcon/midcon19% 19% 19% 17% 18%Hawaii20% 16% 11% 7% 4%Mexico7% 9% 8% 8% 7%Canada2% 1% 2% 3% 3%Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100%MAINLINEWe offer extensive north/south service within the western U.S., Canada and Mexico, and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of Alaska.  We also provide long-haul east/west service to Hawaii and 17 cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S., primarily from Seattle, where we have our largest concentration of departures; although we do offer long-haul departures from other cities as well. In 2012, we carried 19 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations, and we carry more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland than any other airline.  Based on the number of passengers carried in 2012, Alaska’s leading airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Anchorage and Portland.  Based on 2012 revenues, the leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles, Seattle-Las Vegas, and Seattle-San Diego.  At December 31, 2012, Alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 124 Boeing 737 jet aircraft, compared to 117 aircraft as of December 31, 2011.The percentage of mainline passenger traffic by market and average stage length is presented below: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008West Coast29% 31% 33% 36% 40%Within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland16% 17% 19% 21% 21%Transcon/midcon22% 22% 24% 23% 22%Hawaii23% 19% 14% 9% 5%Mexico8% 9% 8% 9% 9%Canada2% 2% 2% 2% 3%Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100%          Average Stage Length1,161 1,114 1,085 1,034 979REGIONAL Our regional operations consists of flights operated by Horizon, SkyWest and Penair.

Horizon is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest and represented over 90% of Air Group's regional revenue passengers during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Based on 2012 passenger enplanements on regional aircraft, our leading airports are Seattle and Portland.  Based on revenues in 2012, our leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Portland, Seattle-Spokane, and Seattle-Boise.  At December 31, 2012, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 48 Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft.  Horizon flights are listed under Alaska's designator code in airline reservation systems, and in all customer-facing locations. 6Table of ContentsThe percentage of regional passenger traffic by market and average stage length is presented below: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008West Coast69% 67% 70% 70% 72%Pacific Northwest20% 21% 19% 20% 18%Canada8% 8% 8% 7% 8%Within Alaska2% 2% 2% 2% 2%Mexico1% 2% 1% 1% —%Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100%          Average Stage Length294 309 333 327 322INDUSTRY CONDITIONS, COMPETITION, AND ALLIANCES GENERALThe airline industry is highly competitive, subject to various uncertainties, and has historically been characterized by low profit margins.  Uncertainties include general economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, new competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation, and potential aircraft incidents.  Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership, and facilities rents.  Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results.  In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results.  Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events, and total available airline seat capacity.In 2012, the industry continued to exercise capacity discipline due to economic uncertainty and volatile fuel prices.  This allowed the industry to report stronger adjusted pretax profit margins compared to 2011. FUELOur business and financial results are highly affected by the price and, potentially, the availability of aircraft fuel.  The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control, and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results.  Over the past five years, aircraft fuel expense ranged from 21% to 36% of operating expenses. Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins, and can vary by region in the U.S.  The price of crude oil spiked in 2008 with a high of nearly $150 per barrel in July 2008 and dropped significantly to an average of $62 per barrel in 2009.  We saw upward pressure on fuel prices again with an average crude oil price of just over $80 per barrel in 2010, $95 per barrel in 2011 and $94 per barrel in 2012.  For us, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately $10 million of additional fuel cost annually.  Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $4 million per year.Refining margins, which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel, are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel, but also contributed to the overall price volatility in recent years.  Refining margin prices reached a high of $45 per barrel in May 2008, before they dropped to an average price of $10 per barrel in 2009 and $14 a barrel in 2010.  Refining margin prices more than doubled to $33 a barrel in 2011 and increased again to $36 a barrel in 2012.  Generally, West Coast aircraft fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast, putting our mainline operation at a slight competitive disadvantage.  Our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 2% in 2012, 36% in 2011, and 27% in 2010.7Table of ContentsThe percentage of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins, as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008Crude oil65% 70% 79% 82% 68%Refining margins25% 24% 14% 13% 16%Other(a)10% 6% 7% 5% 16%Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100%          Aircraft fuel expense35% 34% 27% 21% 36%(a) Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges, unrealized mark-to-market fuel hedge gains or losses, taxes and other into-plane costs.We use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices.  Both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption.  With the call option contracts, we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.  The swap contracts do not require an upfront premium, but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period.We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices.  Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet and Horizon operates an all-Q400 turboprop fleet.  Alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved from 72.6 ASMs/g in 2008 to 76.6 ASMs/g in 2012.  These reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit.COMPETITIONCompetition in the airline industry is intense.  We believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are: •safety record and reputation, •fares,•non-ticket fees, •flight schedules, •customer service, •routes served, •frequent flier programs, •on-time arrivals, •baggage handling, •on-board amenities, •type of aircraft, and •codesharing relationships. We compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes, including both major legacy carriers and low-cost carriers.  Due to its short-haul markets, our regional operations occasionally compete with ground transportation in many markets.  Both carriers, to some extent, also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency of face-to-face business meetings.8Table of ContentsALLIANCES WITH OTHER AIRLINESWe have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as codesharing on certain flights as shown in the table below.  Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by: •offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities;•giving our Mileage Plan program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from two of the three major global alliances (Oneworld and Skyteam); •giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and •providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and its regional affiliates while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs. Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sell codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk.  Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and at any time, one or more may be in the process of renegotiation.  American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are our primary codeshare partners.  They participate in two of the three major global alliances. Our marketing alliances with other airlines are as follows: FrequentFlyerAgreement Codeshare —Alaska Flight # on Flights Operated by Other Airline Codeshare —Other Airline Flight # on Flights Operated byAlaska / Horizon / SkyWestMajor U.S. or International Airlines     Aeromexico(a)Yes No YesAmerican Airlines/American EagleYes Yes YesAir FranceYes No YesBritish AirwaysYes No NoCathay Pacific AirwaysYes No YesDelta Air Lines(b)Yes Yes YesEmiratesYes No NoIcelandairYes No YesKLMYes No YesKorean AirYes No YesLan S.A.Yes No YesAir Pacific(c)Yes No YesQantasYes No YesRegional Airlines     SkyWest(c)Yes Yes NoEra AlaskaYes Yes NoPenAir(c)Yes Yes NoKenmore Air(c)Yes No No(a) Alaska and Aeromexico launched a new codeshare partnership in December 2012, and plan to commence a reciprocal frequent flyer partnership by March 31, 2013.(b) Alaska has codeshare agreements with the Delta Connection carriers SkyWest, ExpressJet, Pinnacle, and Compass as part of its agreement with Delta.  (c) These airlines do not have their own frequent flyer program.  However, Alaska’s Mileage Plan members can earn and redeem miles on these airlines’ route systems.9Table of ContentsTICKET DISTRIBUTION Airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels: •Alaskaair.com:  It is less expensive for us to sell through this direct channel and, as a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website.  In addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly. •Traditional and online travel agencies:  Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS), such as Sabre, to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines.  Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline.  Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies.  Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs. •Reservation call centers:  These call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID.  We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through these call centers.Our sales by channel are as follows:  2012 2011 2010 2009 2008Alaskaair.com54% 51% 48% 45% 48%Traditional agencies27% 28% 28% 32% 28%Online travel agencies13% 13% 15% 11% 14%Reservation call centers6% 8% 9% 12% 10%Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100%SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORSOur results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic.  Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska.  However, we have taken steps over the past few years to better respond to the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations, like Hawaii, and expanding to cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S.In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include:  •general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand,•      pricing initiatives by us or our competitors, •changes in fuel costs, •the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures (both planned and unplanned), •increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs, and •labor actions. Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceling flights, and reaccommodate displaced passengers.  Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, than some of our competitors, who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems.No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.10Table of Contents11Table of ContentsEMPLOYEES Our business is labor intensive.  As of December 31, 2012, we employed 12,932 (9,954 at Alaska and 2,978 at Horizon) active full-time and part-time employees.  Wages and benefits, including variable incentive pay, represented approximately 42% and 41% of our total non-fuel operating expenses in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Most major airlines, including ours, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition.  New entrants into the U.S. airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces, and often have lower costs and more liberal work rules.  At December 31, 2012, labor unions represented 83% of Alaska’s and 49% of Horizon’s employees.  Our relations with our U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date.  If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement.  After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.Alaska’s union contracts at December 31, 2012 were as follows:Union Employee Group Number ofActive Employees Contract StatusAir Line Pilots Association International (ALPA) Pilots 1,452 Amendable 4/1/2013Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) Flight attendants 2,987 In NegotiationsInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Ramp service and stock clerks 573 Amendable 7/19/2018IAM Clerical, office and passenger service 2,496 Amendable 1/1/2014Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) Mechanics, inspectors and cleaners 624 Amendable 10/17/2016Mexico Workers Association of Air Transport Mexico airport personnel 83 Amendable 9/1/2013Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) Dispatchers 39 Amendable 3/24/2015 Horizon’s union contracts at December 31, 2012 were as follows:Union Employee Group Number ofActive Employees Contract StatusInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Pilots 550 Amendable 12/11/2018AFA Flight attendants 505 In NegotiationsIBT Mechanics and related classifications 298 Amendable 12/16/2014TWU Dispatchers 18 Amendable 8/26/2014National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Station personnel in Vancouver and Victoria, BC, Canada 46 Amendable 2/14/2016IAM Maintenance Stores 34 In Negotiations12Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE OFFICERS The executive officers of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and executive officers of Alaska and Horizon who have significant decision-making responsibilities, their positions and their respective ages are as follows: Name Position Age Air Groupor SubsidiaryOfficer SinceBradley Tilden President and Chief Executive Officer of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. 52 1994       Glenn Johnson Executive Vice President of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. 54 1991       Keith Loveless Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. 56 1996       Benito Minicucci Executive Vice President/Operations and Chief Operating Officer of Alaska Airlines, Inc. 46 2004       Brandon Pedersen Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. 46 2003 Mr. Tilden joined Alaska Airlines in 1991, became Controller of Alaska Air Group and Alaska Airlines in 1994, Chief Financial Officer in February 2000, Executive Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer in January 2002, Executive Vice President/Finance and Planning in 2007, and President of Alaska Airlines in December 2008.

The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. •DOT:  In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT.  Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates.  While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without governmental regulation, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, carrier liability for personal or property damage, and certain airport rates and charges disputes.  International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights.  The DOT has recently been active in implementing a variety of “passenger protection” regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response.  Beginning January 2012, we began adhering to the DOT's full-fare advertising rule, which requires quoted fares to include all applicable government taxes and fees.  International fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve.  Beginning in July 2012, DOT rules stipulated that airlines must charge passengers the same checked baggage fee on all legs of a journey covered by a single ticket, even if the passenger's journey involves flights on multiple carriers with different checked baggage fees.•FAA:  The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards.  Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA.  Pursuant to these regulations we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate.  The maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls.  From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs.  At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.  New FAA rules regarding pilot flight time, duty period and rest came into effect in 2012.  The rule limits flight time to eight to nine hours and duty period to nine to 14 hours.  In addition, the rule requires 10-hour minimum rest periods prior to the duty period and at least 30 consecutive hours free from duty on a weekly basis.  The rule also places 28-day and annual limits on actual flight time.•TSA:  Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations.  Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations.  We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.  Under TSA authority, we are also required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security measures.  Carriers also pay the TSA a security infrastructure fee to cover passenger and property screening costs.  These security infrastructure fees amounted to $13 million each year in 2012, 2011 and 2010.  The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.  The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.  Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.  To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies.ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries.  U.S. federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and the Oil Pollution Control Act.  We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations.  In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes.  Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations.  We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.We expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.  Alaska and Horizon have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets, thereby greatly reducing our total emissions.The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system.  Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews.  We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions. Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.INSURANCEWe carry Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft, spare parts and spare engines, as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties.  Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, this insurance program excludes coverage for War and Allied Perils, including hijacking, terrorism, malicious acts, strikes, riots, civil commotion and other identified perils.  So, like other airlines, the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the U.S. government.We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance.WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available on our website at www.alaskaair.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing of these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The information contained on our website is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS If any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.  In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline.  We operate in a continually changing business environment.  In this environment, new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence.  Management cannot predict such developments, nor can it assess the impact, if any, on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forward-looking statements. We have adopted an enterprise wide Risk Analysis and Oversight Program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight.  These enterprise-level identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below.SAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCEOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident. An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public and/or aviation authorities.  We could experience significant claims from injured passengers, by-standers and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service.  We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers.  However, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from an accident.  Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related 14Table of Contentsinsurance coverage would harm our business and financial results.  Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, which would harm our business.Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions. Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant compliance costs.  In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the U.S. DOT, the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protections.  Similarly, many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11, 2001, many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers.  Additional laws, regulations, taxes, and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel.  Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “pass-through” costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business.The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry, including our company.  Additional terrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the U.S. could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry, including us, and could: •significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel; •significantly increase security and insurance costs; •make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive; •increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices; •increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats; and •result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA. The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party vendors for certain critical activities. We have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, ground handling, fueling, computer reservation system hosting, telecommunication systems, and information technology infrastructure and services.  As part of our cost-reduction efforts, our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future, especially since we rely on timely and effective third-party performance in conjunction with many of our technology-related initiatives.  In addition, in recent years, Alaska and Horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance, fleet service, facilities maintenance, and ground handling services at certain airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to outside vendors. Even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels, our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks.  In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all.  If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately, we may experience increased costs, delays, maintenance issues, safety issues or negative public perception of our airline.  Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms.  These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure.15Table of ContentsOur operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including delays, cancellations, and other conditions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Like other airlines, our operations often are affected by delays, cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control.Other conditions that might impact our operations include: •air traffic congestion at airports or other air traffic control problems; •adverse weather conditions; •increased security measures or breaches in security; •international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity; and•other changes in business conditions.Due to our concentration of flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors.  A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the above-mentioned factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.STRATEGYThe airline industry is highly competitive.  If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.We face significant competition with respect to routes, services, and fares.  Some of our competitors have lower costs than we do and compete directly against us in our markets.  We continue to strive toward aggressive cost-reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital.  If we are unable to reduce our costs over the long-term and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital, we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer.We depend on a few key markets to be successful. Our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets, including Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Hawaii and Anchorage.  A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle hub.  In 2012, passengers to and from Seattle accounted for 61% of our total passengers.We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft, and ground facilities, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions.  As a result, we remain highly dependent on our key markets.  Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets.  An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations. The recent U.S. and global economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel.  While some economic indicators are showing signs of growth, unemployment remains high in some of our key markets.  Given that the strength of the U.S. and global economies have an impact on the demand for air travel, a long-term economic slump could result in a need to adjust our capacity plans, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts. Alaska is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts.  Horizon is similarly dependent on Bombardier.  Additionally, each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines.  As a result, we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts, including design defects, mechanical problems, 16Table of Contentscontractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements. Alaska and Horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers, or “partners," including, but not limited to, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.  These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights.  In addition, the agreements generally provide that members of Alaska’s Mileage Plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa.  We receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements.  In addition, we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our Mileage Plan program.  The loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights through bankruptcy, consolidation, or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan, which we believe is a source of competitive advantage.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business, and a failure to invest in new technology, or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business. We depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our airline reservation system, our telecommunication systems, our website, our maintenance systems, our check-in kiosks, and other systems.  Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks.  We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets.  In order for our operations to work efficiently, we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website, reservation system, and check-in systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information, and deliver important flight information.  Substantial or repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline.  In addition, we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling, flight dispatch, and other operational needs.  Disruptions, untimely recovery, or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data, an increase of our expenses, an impact on our operational performance, or a possible temporary cessation of our operations.If we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information, we could damage our reputation and  incur substantial legal and regulatory costs.We accept, store, and transmit information about our customers, our employees, our business partners and our business.  In addition, we frequently rely on third-party hosting sites and data processors, including cloud providers.   Our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks.  A compromise of our systems, the security of our infrastructure, or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETSOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses, accounting for 35%, 34% and 27% of total operating expenses for the years ended 2012, 2011  and 2010, respectively.  Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs.The outcome of the resolution process, and any subsequent challenge, through which new lease terms at Sea-Tac will be set cannot be predicted with certainty.Our lease with the Port of Seattle for terminal space at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport expired on December 31, 2012.  Negotiations for a new lease have thus far been unsuccessful.  Absent a negotiated lease, federal law requires the Port to set new rates by means of a resolution.  The Company and other Sea-Tac carriers may accept the new resolution or ask the DOT to set them aside as unreasonable under federal law.  The resolution process and any subsequent challenge by us or other airlines will not interrupt our tenancy at Sea-Tac.17Table of ContentsOur continuing obligation to fund our traditional defined-benefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.Our defined-benefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk.  If market returns are poor in the future or if interest rates used to discount our future obligation decrease, any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity.  Poor market returns or low interest rates could lead to higher pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations.  The calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry.  Furthermore, the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through December 31, 2013.  Although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage, we cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or if it does, for how long the extension will last.  It is expected that, should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry, the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited, including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods.  Significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.BRAND AND REPUTATIONAs we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets, we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all Customers . We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers.  These efforts could include significant improvements to our in-airport and on-board environments, increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals (digital and mobile), and optimization of our customer loyalty programs.   If in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base, which could result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.  LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGYA significant increase in labor costs, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees, or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses, accounting for approximately 42%, 41% and 43% of our non-fuel operating expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement, and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them.As of December 31, 2012, labor unions represented approximately 83% of Alaska’s and 49% of Horizon’s employees.  Although we have been successful in maturing communications, negotiating approaches, and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the Company's long-term vision, future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction, affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues.We compete against the major U.S. airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions.  If we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost, sustain employee engagement in the Company's strategic vision, or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff, we may be unable to grow or sustain our business.  In such case, our operating results and business prospects could be harmed. ITEM 1B
