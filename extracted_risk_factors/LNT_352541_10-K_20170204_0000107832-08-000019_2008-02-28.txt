2)  CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND INVESTMENT PLANS

Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in MDA for discussion of anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for 2008, 2009 and 2010.

 

3)  REGULATION - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies.  The following includes the primary regulations impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.

 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) - Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities and other entities regulated by FERC.  IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA 2005 for various issues including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books and records requirements.  In addition, the Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC designated the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) as the overarching ERO.  The Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), which is a regional member of NERC, has direct
responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.  FERC also has jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale rates, dividend payments and accounting practices of IPL and WPL, among other issues.  Lastly, FERC has jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.

 

Environmental - The United States of America (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management and transportation, and solid waste management requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental programs to local agencies.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations.

 

IUB - IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in Iowa for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities.  A Certificate of Public Convenience, Use and Necessity is required to be filed with the IUB for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in Iowa with a capacity in excess of 25 megawatts (MW).  Requests for retail rate relief are based on historical test periods, adjusted for certain known and measurable
changes occurring up to nine months from the end of the historical test period.  The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate relief within 10 months of the date of the application for which relief is filed, or the interim rates granted become permanent.  Interim retail
rates can be placed in effect 10 days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past precedent.  Iowa’s HF 577 provides Iowa utilities with the necessary rate making principles - and resulting, increased regulatory and investment
certainty - prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa.  IPL must file for rate making principles under HF 577 for certain electric generating facilities located in Iowa including new base-load (primarily defined as nuclear or coal-fired generation) facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more,
combined-cycle natural gas-fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind facilities, of any size.  Upon approval of rate making principles by the IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate making principles, or not at all.

 

Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) - Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the
type and amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other issues.  WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use
of proceeds of securities, approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.  A Certificate of Authority (CA) application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in Wisconsin with a capacity of 99 MW or less.  A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN)
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in Wisconsin with a capacity of 100 MW or more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities
outside of Wisconsin (including Minnesota) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.  WPL is required to file retail rate cases with the PSCW using a forward-looking test period.  There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide retail rate cases.  However, the PSCW attempts to process all base retail
rate cases in 10 months or less and the PSCW has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.  For fuel-only retail rate case increases, the PSCW attempts to provide interim retail rate relief within 21 days of notice to customers, subject to refund.  There is no statutory time limit for final fuel-only retail rate relief decisions.  Wisconsin’s Act 7
provides Wisconsin utilities with the necessary rate making principles - and resulting, increased regulatory and investment certainty - prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled electric generating facility or renewable
generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL is not obligated to file for rate making principles under Act 7.  WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate making if the terms of the rate making principles issued under Act 7 are viewed as unsatisfactory by WPL.

 

3 

Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) - IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in Minnesota for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, annual approval of IPL’s capital structure, and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.  Requests for retail rate relief can be based on either historical or projected data and interim retail rates are permitted.  The MPUC must reach a final decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief.

IPL and WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers in several industries, including wet corn milling, chemicals (including ethanol) and paper mills.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB or MPUC that include recovery of capacity costs and other costs required to serve customers.  IPL’s fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of fuel-related costs (generation and purchased energy), capacity costs and other costs required to serve customers.  The electric fuel rules in Wisconsin allow WPL to request rate increases/decreases if fuel and purchased energy costs exceed or fall below PSCW established fuel monitoring ranges.

 

Wholesale customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings.

 

In addition, IPL and WPL have bulk power customers, included in “Other customers” in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated, long-term customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC approved tariffs.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding electric utility operations.

 

Seasonality - Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements.  In 2007, the maximum peak hour demands for Alliant Energy and IPL were 5,751 MW and 3,085 MW, respectively, both on Aug. 28, 2007.  In 2007, the maximum peak hour demand for WPL was 2,816 MW on Aug. 1, 2007.

 

Competition - Retail electric customers in Iowa and Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  However, in order to increase sales, IPL and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories.  As a result, there is competition among utilities to keep energy rates low.  Although electric service in Iowa and Wisconsin is regulated, IPL and WPL also still face competition from self generation by large industrial customers, alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).

 

Renewable Energy - Wisconsin and Minnesota have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require electric utilities to provide certain percentages of their total energy output from renewable sources by certain dates.  IPL and WPL currently meet all applicable renewable energy requirements and continue to emphasize the expansion of renewable energy in their overall energy supply portfolios.  Refer to “Rates and Regulatory Matters - Recent Regulatory-related Legislative Developments” and “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plan” in MDA for further discussion of renewable energy standards and various proposed wind projects that are expected to contribute towards IPL and WPL continuing to meet these standards.

 

Energy Conservation - With increased emphasis on energy conservation as a matter of public policy, IPL and WPL are continuing and, where appropriate, expanding initiatives to promote energy conservation and enhance customers’ ability to manage their energy use more efficiently.  IPL and WPL are also exploring rate making alternatives which are expected to maintain their respective financial stability in the event that energy use declines, and avoid penalizing IPL and WPL for successful energy conservation initiatives.  Refer to “Rates and Regulatory Matters - Other Recent Regulatory Developments” in MDA for further discussion regarding an Advanced Metering Infrastructure project, which is expected to enhance energy management initiatives.

Electric Supply - Alliant Energy has met historical customer demand of electricity and expects to continue meeting future demand through internally generated electric supply, purchased power agreements (PPAs) utilizing existing firm transmission rights, and additional power purchases from generating units located within and outside of Alliant Energy’s service territory.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for a profile of the sources of electric supply used to meet customer demand for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL from 2003 to 2007.  Alliant Energy’s mix of electric supply has experienced changes in the past few years as a result of the sales of its interests in its nuclear generating facilities.  Alliant Energy’s mix of electric supply is expected to change further in the future with its Utility Generation
Plan, which includes the construction of two new coal-fired generating facilities and several wind farms and the purchase of Resources’ natural gas-fired generating facility in Neenah, Wisconsin.  The proposed new generation included in the Utility Generation Plan is expected to meet increasing customer demand, reduce reliance on PPAs and mitigate the impacts of future plant retirements while maintaining compliance with an 18% electric demand reserve margin established by regulators.  Alliant Energy currently expects to meet utility customer demands in the future; however, unanticipated regional or local reliability issues could still arise in the event of unexpected delays in the construction of new generating and/or transmission facilities, generating facility outages, transmission system outages or extended periods of extreme weather conditions.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plan” in MDA for details of Alliant Energy’s utility generation
plan.

 

Generation - IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to Item 2. Properties for details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating stations.

 

Generating Capability - The summer generating capability of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating facilities by fuel type in MWs for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows:

Coal - Coal is the primary fuel source for Alliant Energy’s internally generated electric supply.  Internally generated electric supply from coal-fired generating facilities represented 57%, 53% and 52% of IPL’s total sources of electric energy and 52%, 51% and 49% of WPL’s total sources of electric energy during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2008 through 2012.  As of Dec. 31, 2007, these contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 75%, 52%, 27%, 13%, and 5% of Alliant Energy’s estimated coal supply needs for 2008 through
2012, respectively.  Alliant Energy believes this portfolio of coal supplies represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes.  Alliant Energy expects to meet remaining coal requirements from either future contracts or purchases in the spot market.

The majority of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating stations, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply targets of 25 to 50 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations with seasonal deliveries.  Actual inventory averages for 2007 were 57 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 67 days for generating stations with seasonal deliveries.  Alliant Energy is currently in the process of testing coal from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to
determine which alternative sources of coal are most compatible with its generating stations.  Alternative sources of coal are expected to provide Alliant Energy with further protection against interruptions and lessen its dependence on its primary coal source.

 

Average delivered fossil fuel costs are expected to continue to increase in the future due to price structures and adjustment provisions in existing coal contracts, rate structures and adjustment provisions in existing transportation contracts, fuel-related surcharges incorporated by transportation carriers and recent coal and transportation market trends.  Existing coal commodity contracts with terms of greater than one year have fixed future year prices that generally reflect recent market trends.  A few of the existing coal contracts have provisions for price adjustments should specific indices change.  Rate adjustment provisions in older transportation contracts are primarily based on changes in the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor as published by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.  Rate adjustment provisions in more recent transportation contracts are based on changes in the All Inclusive Index Less Fuel
as published by the Association of American Railroads.  These more recent transportation contracts also contain fuel surcharges that are subject to change monthly based on changes in diesel fuel prices.  Other factors that may impact coal prices for future commitments are increasing costs for supplier mineral rights, increasing costs to mine the coal and changes in various associated laws and regulations.  For example, emission restrictions related to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, along with other environmental limitations on generating stations, continue to increase and will likely limit the ability to obtain, and further increase the cost of, adequate coal supplies.  Factors that may impact future transportation rates include: the need for railroads to enhance/expand infrastructure for demand growth, corresponding investments in locomotives and crews and the desire to improve margins on coal commensurate with margins on non-coal movements.  Alliant Energy believes
that, given its current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in its primary purchase region, and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms, it is reasonably insulated against coal price volatility.  Alliant Energy’s coal procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of coverage going forward for five to six years and supplier diversity.  Similarly, given the term lengths of its transportation agreements, Alliant Energy believes it is reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.  As of Dec. 31, 2007, existing coal transportation agreements cover approximately 100% of IPL’s and WPL’s estimated needs through 2009, approximately 81% for 2010, approximately 77% for 2011 and 2012, approximately 57% for 2013 and 2014 and approximately 12% for 2015.

 

Natural Gas - Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities including IPL’s 565 MW, natural gas-fired Emery Generating Facility (Emery) and Resources’ 300 MW, natural gas-fired Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility (SFEF).  WPL has exclusive rights to the output of SFEF under an affiliated lease agreement.  These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands.  Internally generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities represented 6%, 5% and 6% of Alliant Energy’s total sources of electric energy during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 

Alliant Energy has responsibility to supply natural gas to certain generating facilities under PPAs, which include the Riverside Energy Center (Riverside) and the RockGen Energy Center (RockGen), as well as the generating facilities it owns.  IPL and WPL have contracts with several companies to provide fixed-price natural gas supply for these generating facilities with the longest contracts having terms through December 2009.  WPL has also contracted with ANR Pipeline to provide firm pipeline transportation of 60,000 dekatherms (Dths) per day for Riverside and 52,800 Dths per day (June to September) for SFEF, and 2 million Dths of storage capacity for WPL’s natural gas-fired generating stations through March 2015.  IPL has also contracted with Northern Border Pipeline to provide firm pipeline transportation of 45,000 Dths per day for Emery through October 2008.

 

In addition to entering into fixed-price supply contracts, IPL and WPL have hedging programs reviewed by the IUB and PSCW, respectively, which use hedges to help protect against the impacts of volatile natural gas prices.  IPL has 83% of the gas supply costs for its forecasted natural gas-fired electric generation hedged for 2008 and 41% for 2009.  WPL has 100% of the gas supply costs for its forecasted natural gas-fired electric generation hedged for 2008 and 95% for 2009.

Nuclear - Internally generated electric supply from nuclear generating facilities represented 17% of IPL’s total sources of electric energy and 2% of WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2005.  In January 2006, IPL sold its interest in the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) to a subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc. (FPL) and upon closing of the sale entered into a PPA with FPL to purchase energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014.  In July 2005, WPL sold its interest in the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) and upon closing of the sale entered into a long-term PPA with Dominion to purchase energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December 2013.  As a result of these transactions, Alliant Energy no longer has an ownership interest in any nuclear generating facilities.  Alliant
Energy entered into these transactions to reduce the financial and operational uncertainty associated with nuclear generating facility ownership and operations while still retaining the benefit of the output from such nuclear generating facilities.

 

Wind - In May 2007, WPL received approval from the PSCW to construct the 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind farm in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, which is expected to begin commercial operation by the end of 2008.  Once complete, Cedar Ridge will be WPL’s first fully owned and operated wind farm site.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plan” in MDA for further discussion.

 

Purchased Power - Alliant Energy enters into PPAs to meet a portion of its customer demand of electricity.  Purchased power represented 33%, 38% and 21% of IPL’s total sources of electric energy and 46%, 47% and 46% of WPL’s total sources of electric energy during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  IPL’s most significant PPA is with FPL for the purchase of energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014.  WPL’s most significant PPAs are with Dominion for the purchase of energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December 2013 and with subsidiaries of Calpine Corporation (Calpine) for the purchase of energy and capacity from Riverside and RockGen through May 2013 and May 2009, respectively.

 

Refer to Note 1(j) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of fuel costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding purchased power commitments accounted for as operating leases and Note 12(b) for details relating to IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments in Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

 

Electric Transmission Business -

IPL - In December 2007, IPL completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois to ITC Midwest LLC (ITC).
IPL sold its electric transmission assets in December 2007 in order to monetize the value of the assets to help fund future capital expenditures, to capture tax benefits under federal tax policy that allows deferral of gains on sales
of qualifying electric transmission assets completed prior to Jan. 1, 2008 and to promote regional transmission expansion that is expected to improve transmission reliability and access for its customers in Iowa and Minnesota.  Refer to Note 21 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of the sale.  ITC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of MISO, MRO and Reliability First
Corporation Regional Reliability Council.  IPL has a non-cancelable operation agreement, which will terminate on Dec. 31, 2035, with Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) and ITC that provides for the joint use of certain transmission facilities.  IPL’s responsibilities for transmission-related duties under this contract have been transferred to ITC as part of the recent sale.  ITC has transmission interconnections at various locations with nine other transmission owning utilities in the Midwest.  These interconnections, along with the interconnections of ATC, enhance the overall reliability of the Alliant Energy transmission system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and emergency energy.  Alliant Energy has been advised that ITC plans to construct additional facilities to improve transmission reliability and import capabilities.  As these facilities are constructed, Alliant Energy expects these facilities will serve to enhance its operating flexibility and
access to lower-cost energy.

 

WPL - In 2001, WPL transferred its transmission assets to ATC in exchange for an ownership interest in ATC.  As of Dec. 31, 2007, WPL held a 17% ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $172 million.  ATC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of MISO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Reliability Council.  ATC realizes its revenues from the provision of transmission services to both participants in ATC as well as non-participants.  During 2007, ATC distributed to WPL, in the form of dividends, $21 million or approximately 80% of WPL’s equity earnings from ATC.  Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC will continue this dividend payout ratio in the future.  ATC is continuing its efforts to improve transmission reliability and import capabilities into Wisconsin, including energizing a
345-kilovolt transmission line between Wausau, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota in 2008.  As these facilities are constructed, Alliant Energy expects they will serve to enhance its operating flexibility and its access to lower-cost energy.  ATC also has various transmission interconnections with three other transmission owning utilities in the Midwest.  WPL anticipates $13 million, $7 million and $5 million of capital contributions to ATC in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

MISO Wholesale Energy Market - IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organization, which is responsible for monitoring and
ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories.
In April 2005, IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO.  The market impacts the way IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services and schedule generation.  In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region.  MISO evaluates IPL’s, WPL’s and other market participants’ energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on
locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission system expansion is needed.  This market-based approach is expected to result in lower overall costs in areas with abundant transmission capacity.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but which would not have operated based on economic needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for variable costs.  In areas of constrained transmission capacity, such as Wisconsin, costs could be higher due to the congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  As part of the MISO market
restructuring, physical transmission rights of IPL and WPL were replaced with Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs).  FTRs provide a hedge for congestion costs that incur in the MISO
day-ahead energy market.  Both IPL and WPL have been awarded FTRs by MISO that are in place through May 31, 2008.  Based on the FTRs awarded to IPL and WPL to date and future expected allocations, along with the expected regulatory recovery treatment of MISO costs, the financial impacts associated with FTRs have not differed significantly from the financial impacts associated with physical transmission rights that existed prior to the MISO market.

 

Refer to “Rates and Regulatory Matters” in MDA for discussion of the regulatory impacts of costs related to MISO and “Other Future Considerations - MISO Wholesale Energy Market” in MDA for discussion of the ancillary services market MISO is currently developing.

 

Electric Environmental Matters - Alliant Energy is regulated in environmental matters by federal, state and local agencies.  Such regulations are the result of a number of environmental laws
passed by the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and local governments and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies.  The laws impacting Alliant Energy’s electric operations include, but are not limited to, the Safe Drinking Water Act; Clean Water Act; Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the CAA Amendments of 1990; National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive Environmental
 Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986; Endangered
Species Act; Occupational Safety and Health Act; National Energy Policy Act, as amended; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; Pollution Prevention Act; and Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.
Alliant Energy regularly obtains federal, state and local permits to assure compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the future.  Alliant Energy anticipates these prudently incurred costs for IPL and WPL will be recoverable through future rate case proceedings.  Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Environmental” in MDA and Note 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of electric environmental matters including environmental regulations under the Clean Air Interstate Rule, Clean Air Mercury Rule, Section
316(b) of the Clean Water Act, Wisconsin Thermal Rule and proposed greenhouse gas (GHG) emission legislation.

In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs.  Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas utility operations.

 

Seasonality - Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in underground storage fields and deliver it in the winter.  Gas storage met approximately 35% of IPL’s and WPL’s annual gas requirements in 2007.

 

Competition - Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring more competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third parties.  It remains uncertain if, and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.

Gas Supply - IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 30 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada.  The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through 2008.  IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily market-based.

 

In providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG), ANR Pipeline (ANR), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (NGPL), Northern Border Pipeline (NBPL) and Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) allow access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory.  In 2007, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths):

D.  INFORMATION RELATING TO NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS

 

Resources manages a relatively small portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional investments through two distinct platforms: Non-regulated Generation and other non-regulated investments.

 

Non-regulated Generation - manages Alliant Energy’s non-regulated electric generating facilities.  In June 2005, Resources completed the construction and commenced commercial operation of the 300 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired SFEF near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin.  Resources owns SFEF and leases it to WPL for an initial period of 20 years.  Refer to Note 3(b) of WPL’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the SFEF lease.  Resources also owns the 300 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired Neenah Energy Facility (NEF) in Neenah, Wisconsin.  The entire power output of NEF is sold under contract to Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based We Energies through May 2008.  Subject to regulatory approval, Resources plans to sell NEF to WPL effective June 1, 2009, which coincides with the expected termination of WPL’s RockGen PPA
scheduled for May 2009.  Resources has entered into a contract to sell NEF’s capacity for the interim time period from June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009.
 Also included in Non-regulated Generation is Industrial Energy Applications, Inc., which provides on-site energy services with small standby generators.

 

Other non-regulated investments - includes investments in environmental consulting, engineering and renewable energy services, transportation and several other modest investments.  RMT, Inc. (RMT) provides environmental consulting, engineering and renewable energy services to industrial and commercial clients nationwide.  RMT’s core environmental services include site remediation and restoration, air quality control, auditing/compliance management, facility siting and planning, and environmental construction.  RMT’s energy platform includes WindConnect®, which delivers design, engineering and construction services for wind farms, and SmartBurn®, which focuses on the application of combustion science technologies to improve performance of coal-fired electric generating facilities and lower nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the process.  Transportation includes a
short-line railway that provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; barge terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.

            DISCLOSURE CONCERNING WEBSITE ACCESS TO REPORTS  

Alliant Energy makes its periodic and current reports, and amendments to those reports, available, free of charge, on its
website at www.alliantenergy.com/investors on the same day as such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Alliant Energy is not including the information contained on its website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

 

You should carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, together with all of the other information contained in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities.  If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.

 

Risks related to the regulation of our business could impact the rates we are able to charge, our costs and our profitability - We are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities, which significantly influences our operating environment and the ability to timely recover costs from customers.  In particular, our utility operations are regulated by regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over public utilities, including the IUB, the PSCW, the MPUC and FERC.  These authorities regulate many aspects of our operations, including: rates charged to customers; costs of fuel, purchased power and natural gas that can be recovered from customers; the authorized rates of return on capital; the amount of deferred costs that may be recovered from customers; our ability to site and construct new generating facilities; authorization to install environmental
pollution control equipment and whether equipment costs can be recovered from customers; construction and maintenance of facilities; operations, including requiring certain sources of energy such as renewable sources and reductions in energy usage by customers; safety; issuance of securities; accounting matters; and transactions between affiliates.  Further, provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility activities and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.  Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain current rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or current authorized rates of return on capital will be earned.  These regulatory authorities are also empowered to impose financial penalties and other sanctions on us if we
are found to have violated statutes and regulations governing utility operations.  IPL and WPL from time to time file rate cases with federal and state regulatory authorities.  In future rate cases, if IPL and WPL do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief, rates are reduced, increased rates are not approved on a timely basis or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from future regulatory activities of any of these agencies.  Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional costs or change business operations or our business plan, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

17 

Risks related to implementing our strategic plan - Our strategic plan is based on increasing our electric generating capacity to meet our customers’ needs by building hybrid base-load coal-fired
generating facilities with biomass fuel capability and wind generating facilities.  The construction of generating facilities is subject to many risks, which may cause increased costs or inability to recover costs, or may impede or block our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.  The state utility commissions may not permit us
to site or construct the generating facilities.  This decision could be based upon any number of factors, including their determination that there is no need for the facilities, the lowering of our
 required electric reserve margin, too large of customer rate increases associated with the new generating facilities, technology changes, environmental concerns or
other factors.  If we receive regulatory approval to build the facilities, advocacy groups or other associations may file lawsuits seeking to overturn or modify the regulatory approvals.  If the state utility commissions do not approve the new generating facilities, or if certain groups successfully challenge the state utility commissions’ decisions to allow the generating facilities, we will not be able to implement our strategic plan and our financial condition and ability to serve our customers could be negatively affected.

 

Further, large construction projects, such as the building of coal and wind generating facilities, are subject to various risks that could cause costs to increase or delays in completion.  These risks include shortages of, the inability to obtain, the cost of and the consistency of labor, materials and equipment, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, the inability to agree to terms of contracts or disputes in contract terms, work stoppages, adverse weather conditions, the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner, changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, governmental actions, legal action, and unforeseen engineering or technology issues.  If the construction of a generating facility is over budget, we may not be able to recover those excess costs.  Inability to recover excess
costs, or inability to complete construction in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

Changes in commodity prices or the availability of commodities may increase the cost of producing electric energy or change the amount we receive from
selling electric energy, harming our financial performance - The prices that we may obtain for electric energy may not compensate for changes in delivered coal, natural gas or electric
energy spot-market costs, or changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of electric energy.  As a result, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers, which may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because the majority of the electricity generated by us is from our coal-fired generating facilities.  We have contracts of varying durations for
the supply and transportation of coal for most of our existing generating capability, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Further, we currently rely on coal primarily from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region may cause us to incur additional costs and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We also have responsibility to supply natural gas to certain natural gas-fired electric generating facilities that we own and lease, which increase our exposure to the more volatile market prices of natural gas.  We have natural gas supply contracts in place which are generally short term in duration.  The natural gas supply commitments are either fixed price in nature or market-based.  As some of the contracts are market-based, and
all of the contracts are short-term, we may not be able to purchase natural gas on terms as favorable as the current contracts when the current contracts expire.  Further, any disruption of production or transportation of natural gas may cause us to incur additional costs to purchase natural gas that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The derivative instruments we use to manage our commodity risks have terms allowing our counterparties to demand cash collateral.  Extensive cash collateral demands could adversely impact our cash flows.

 

18 


Costs of compliance with existing and future laws and the incurrence of liabilities, particularly related to the environment, could adversely affect our profitability - Our operations are subject to extensive regulation including environmental protection laws and regulations relating to, among other things, water discharges, management of hazardous and solid waste, and air emissions such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and mercury.  Laws and regulations affecting our operations have recently been adopted by the EPA and are being implemented in the states we operate, including the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule.  In addition, new regulations from federal and state authorities are under consideration and may be adopted, requiring modifications to our utility operations.  New interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be
adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities.  These regulations, possible new regulations and possible new interpretations may substantially increase compliance expenditures made by us or restrict our operations in the future.  We also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of gas and the production and delivery of electricity for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites.  Citizen groups or others may bring litigation over environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury, and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, such as opacity and other air quality standards which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude
of fines or penalties) related to environmental matters, although we expect them to be material.  The risks associated with compliance and estimating compliance costs include the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations, the possible inability to obtain necessary materials or skilled labor force required for certain equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, the rising costs of equipment, services and labor related to environmental compliance, the possibility that technology will not perform as anticipated, the uncertainty regarding the type of compliance that will finally be required by rules and regulations, partner considerations with respect to our joint-owned facilities, the uncertain treatment of expenditures by regulators in setting our rates and the uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties.  Compliance with
current and future environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs, including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

Actions related to global climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions could impact us - The primary greenhouse gas emitted from our utility operations is carbon dioxide (CO2) from combustion of fossil fuels at our generating facilities.  Our generating facilities are primarily coal-fired facilities, and our strategic plan includes the construction of additional coal-fired facilities, which emit CO2.  Various laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels, and such laws or regulations would require greenhouse gas emissions reductions that could affect utility operations, including such actions as expansion of energy conservation and renewable generation sources. Furthermore, state regulators may consider future climate change policy implications in proceedings related to our requests to construct additional coal-fired
electric generating units in Iowa and Wisconsin as well as environmental upgrades to existing facilities.  Due to the uncertainty of control technologies available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including CO2, as well as the unknown nature of potential compliance obligations should climate change regulations be enacted, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts these future regulations would have on our operations.  In addition, we cannot predict if, or how, state regulators may factor this issue into approvals and permits for us to build new or modify existing coal-fired generation.  All such regulatory results could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategic plan and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by the impacts of weather - Our electric and gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance.  Demand for electricity is greater in the summer months associated with air conditioning requirements.  In addition, market prices for electricity peak in the summer.  Demand for natural gas depends significantly upon weather patterns in winter months due to heavy use for residential and commercial heating.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, we have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.  We expect that unusually mild winters and summers could have
an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

19 


Failure to provide reliable service to our utility customers could adversely affect our operating results - We are currently obligated to supply electric energy in parts of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  From time to time and because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for electric energy required to meet these obligations could exceed our available electric generating capability and energy commitments pursuant to purchased power agreements.  The North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an extensive power outage in our delivery systems.  Power outages in our service territories could result from factors outside of our control or service territories.  If this occurs, we may have to buy electric energy in the market.  Our utilities may not always have the ability to
pass all the costs of purchasing the electric energy on to their customers, and even if they are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered.  Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, it is possible that the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very high.  Even if a supply shortage was brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could diminish our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The transmission system in our utilities’ service territories, especially in Wisconsin, is constrained, limiting our ability to transmit electric energy within our service territories and access electric energy from outside of our service territories.  The transmission constraints could result in failure to provide reliable service to our utility customers or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy.  Failure to
provide safe and reliable service, including effects of equipment failures in electric and natural gas delivery systems or market demand for energy exceeding available supply, may result in reduced revenues and increased maintenance and capital costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, storms or natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - We are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Generation and transmission facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets.  The effects of terrorist threats and activities include, among other things, terrorist actions or responses to such actions or threats, the inability to generate, purchase or transmit electric energy, the risk of significant slowdown in growth or a decline in the U.S. economy, disruption or volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, and the increased cost and adequacy of security and insurance.  Storms or catastrophic natural disasters may also impact our operations.  Terrorist threats and activities, storms and natural disasters may adversely
impact our ability to generate, purchase or transmit electric energy or obtain fuel sources and may significantly slow growth, or cause a decline, in the economy within our service territories, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the cost of repairing damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure due to acts of terrorism, storms or natural disasters, and the loss of revenue if such events prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

Operation of electric generating facilities or capital improvement of utility facilities may involve unanticipated changes or delays in operations that could negatively impact our business - The operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, transmission lines or pipelines, use of technology, the dependence on a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, as well as the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency.  These risks could negatively impact our business through asset degradation, lost revenues or increased costs, including the cost of replacement power.  Additionally, our ability to successfully and timely complete planned capital improvements to existing facilities within established budgets is contingent upon many variables and may
be subject to substantial risks.  Should such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be subject to additional costs and increased risk of non-recovery of construction or improvement costs through rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

We are exposed to risks related to economic conditions - Our utility operations are impacted by the economic conditions in our service territories.  If economic conditions decline in our service territories, we may experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas which could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.  In addition, adverse economic conditions in our service territories could negatively impact our collections of accounts receivable.  Any national economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan.  A decline in economic conditions in our service territories or nationally could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

20 


We are subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends - Alliant Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own.  Accordingly, the primary sources of funds for Alliant Energy to pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on Alliant Energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations and the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries.  Our utilities each have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of their outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations
applicable to them.  If we do not receive adequate dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, then we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on Alliant Energy common stock.

 

We may incur material post-closing adjustments related to past asset and business divestitures - We recently sold several non-core assets and businesses, including our international businesses and IPL’s electric transmission assets.  Pursuant to the terms of those sales, we may face post-closing adjustments that could be material.  In addition, we might be required to make payments on liabilities that we retained pursuant to the terms of the sales.  Required material post-closing adjustments or payments on retained liabilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 

We are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses - We are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of qualified personnel, collective bargaining agreements with employees and work stoppage that could affect our businesses and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Further, our workforce is dominated by members of the baby boomer generation who are nearing retirement.  As a large portion of our workforce prepares to retire, we must recruit and train new employees to replace them.  Costs of recruitment and the ability to find qualified employees are expected to become more difficult as our workforce retires.  These factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

 

Inability to access financial markets - We rely on accessing the capital markets to support capital expenditure programs and other capital requirements, including expenditures to build utility infrastructure and comply with future regulatory requirements.  Successful implementation of our strategic plan and other long-term business strategies is dependent upon the ability of us to access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates.  We have forecasted capital expenditures of over $4 billion over the next three years.  Capital markets, particularly debt markets, have been under considerable strain recently, resulting in negative impacts on the availability and terms of credit available to certain businesses.  If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry
conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets, or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.

 

Energy industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses - As a public utility company with significant utility assets, we conduct our utility operations in an ever-changing business environment.  The advent of new markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The evolution of the wholesale and transmission markets has the potential to significantly increase costs of transmission, costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, costs of participation in the new markets and costs stemming from estimated payment settlements.  Competitive pressures, including advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in our utilities losing market share and customers
and incurring stranded costs (i.e., assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable through customer rates as a result of competitive pricing), which would be borne by our shareowners.  Although the pace of restructuring in our primary retail electric service territories has been delayed (and may continue to be delayed for a long period of time) due to uncertainty and developments in the industry, we cannot predict the timing of a restructured electric industry or the impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
