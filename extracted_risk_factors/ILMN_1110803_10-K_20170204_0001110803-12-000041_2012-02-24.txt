BusinessOverviewWe are a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function.  We were incorporated in California in April 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000.  Our principal executive offices are located at 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, California 92122.  Our telephone number is (858) 202-4500. Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a comprehensive line of genetic analysis solutions, with products and services that serve a broad range of highly interconnected markets, including sequencing, genotyping, gene expression, and molecular diagnostics.  Our customers include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, and consumer genomics companies.Our broad portfolio of systems, consumables, and analysis tools are designed to simplify genetic analysis.  This portfolio addresses a range of genomic complexity, price points, and throughputs, enabling researchers to select the best solution for their scientific challenge.  In 2007, through our acquisition of Solexa, Inc., we acquired our proprietary sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technology that is at the heart of our leading-edge sequencing instruments.  These systems can be used to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) analyses on large numbers of samples.  For more focused studies, our array-based solutions provide ideal tools to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and copy number variation analyses, as well as gene expression profiling, and other DNA, RNA, and protein studies.  To further enhance our genetic analysis workflows, in January 2011 we acquired Epicentre Technologies Corporation, a leading provider of nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and microarray applications.  In 2010, through our acquisition of Helixis, Inc., we expanded our portfolio to include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one of the most widely used technologies in life sciences.  Our Eco Real-Time PCR System provides researchers with an affordable, full-featured system to perform targeted validation studies.Industry BackgroundGenetics PrimerThe instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, with the complete set of DNA for any organism referred to as its genome.  DNA contains small regions called genes, which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled A, C, G, and T, representing adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, respectively.  These nucleotide bases are present in a precise order known as the DNA sequence.  When a gene is “expressed,” a partial copy of its DNA sequence - called messenger RNA (mRNA) - is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein.  Proteins, in turn, direct all cellular function.  The illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic.  4Table of ContentsVariations among organisms are due, in large part, to differences in their DNA sequences.  Changes caused by insertions, deletions, inversions, or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in certain genes becoming over-expressed (excessive protein production), under-expressed (reduced protein production), or silenced altogether, sometimes triggering changes in cellular function.  These changes can be the result of heredity, but most often they occur at random.  The most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a DNA sequence.  Copy number variations (CNVs) occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes, segments of a gene, or stretches of DNA.In humans, genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see (e.g., height, hair, eye color, etc.).  More importantly, these genetic variations can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility, including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease.  They can also impact an individual's response to certain drug treatments, causing them to respond well, not respond at all, or experience adverse side effects - an area of study known as pharmacogenomics.Scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans, as well as a broad range of animals, plants, and microorganisms.  Researchers investigating human, viral, and bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand the mechanisms of disease, and thereby develop more effective therapeutics and diagnostics.  Greater insight into genetic variation in plants (e.g., food and biofuel crops) and animals (e.g., livestock and domestic animals) is enabling scientists to improve crop yields and animal breeding programs.  The methods for studying genetic variation and biological function include sequencing, SNP genotyping, CNV analysis, gene expression profiling, and gene regulation and epigenetic analysis, each of which is addressed by our breadth of products and services.Life Sciences Research PrimerLife science research encompasses the study of all living things, from humans, animals, and plants, to viruses and bacteria.  It is being performed in government, university, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrigenomics laboratories around the world, where scientists are seeking to expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life.  Beginning at the genetic level, where our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes, life science research expands to include the study of the cells, tissues, organs, systems, and other components that make up living organisms.  This research supports development of new, more effective clinical diagnostics and medicines to improve human health, as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the world's growing needs for food and energy.Molecular Diagnostics PrimerMolecular diagnostic assays (or tests) are designed to identify the biological indicators linked with disease and drug metabolism, providing physicians with information to more effectively diagnose, treat, and monitor both acute and chronic disease conditions.  They are an integral part of personalized healthcare, where the unique makeup of each individual will be taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment through the use of more tailored therapies.  Biological indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein or gene expression, methylation levels, copy number variations, and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes. There are molecular diagnostic assays on the market, including assays for infectious disease, cancer, and heart disease, as well as molecular-based drug metabolism assays to help physicians select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects.  Our innovative technologies and products are contributing to the development of a wide range of potential molecular diagnostic assays.  Our own efforts in this area are currently focused on the identification of certain genetic markers with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility.  Growing news coverage about the clinical relevance of newly discovered genetic markers has prompted consumer interest in having personal genomes analyzed, sparking the development of the consumer genomics market.  We believe there are distinct medical benefits, especially for people with family histories of certain diseases, of knowing your disease predisposition.  Several companies, including Illumina, now offer personal sequencing or genotyping services, working with physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results for consumers.  We believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of molecular diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine, ushering in the era of personalized medicine.5Table of ContentsOur Principal MarketsFrom the company's inception, we have believed that the analysis of genetic variation and function will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology, and that by empowering genetic analysis, our tools will advance disease research, drug development, and the creation of molecular tests.  In addition to developing sequencing- and array-based solutions for life science, applied, and consumer genomics markets, we are making inroads into the emerging molecular diagnostics market.Life Sciences Research MarketOur core business is in the life sciences research market, which consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.  Researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities, such as: next-generation sequencing, mid-to-high-complexity genotyping and gene expression (for whole-genome discovery and profiling), and low complexity genotyping and gene expression (for high-throughput targeted screening).  DNA sequencing is growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the creation of next generation sequencing technologies, such as SBS.  It is fueled by private and public funding, new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation, and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencing-based technologies.Applied MarketsWe provide products and services for various other markets, which we refer to as “applied markets.”  The largest among these is the “AgBio” market, where government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and array-based tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research.  For example, we currently offer microarrays that contain SNPs for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops (such as maize, tomatoes, apples, and peaches), livestock (such as cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep), and companion animals (such as dogs).  Customers use these tools to perform selective breeding through high-value trait screening methods, thereby accelerating and enhancing the process as compared to traditional methods such as cross-breeding. We have developed a high-growth recurring revenue business in both the livestock and agricultural segments, which represented approximately 12% of our shipments on a dollar basis in 2011.  Emerging opportunities in the applied markets include forensics and pet genomics.Molecular Diagnostics MarketMolecular diagnostics is the fastest growing segment of the diagnostics market.  Genetics and oncology represent the primary areas of growth within molecular diagnostics.  At present, this growth is largely driven by infectious disease testing, but molecular diagnostics is rapidly expanding into new areas such as non-invasive prenatal testing and cancer management.  The increasing efficacy of molecular diagnostics is driven by the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility, the increasing adoption of genetic-based diagnostic tests, and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved molecular diagnostic tests.  We believe our sequencing and array instrument platforms are foundational to continued growth in this market, and we intend to submit our iScan and MiSeq systems to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for clearance as a device for use with in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products.  In connection with our anticipated FDA submission, we have initiated a clinical trial for a cytogenetics test intended to be used on our iScan instrument platform as an aid in the postnatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated with developmental delay and mental retardation.  Following completion of the required clinical trial, we intend to seek FDA clearance for the iScan instrument platform and related reagents.  In addition, we have initiated development of clinical diagnostic tests on the MiSeq system in the areas of genetics and infectious disease, and upon completion of the required work we intend to submit these to the FDA for clearance.  Our research efforts in the development of cancer diagnostic panels (initially focusing on ovarian, gastric, and colorectal cancers) continues, and we have filed provisional patent applications on our discoveries to date.  In addition, as the molecular diagnostics market continues to evolve and emerge, we believe the translational and consumer genomic market will prove to be another opportunity for us. These markets include consumer based genetic solutions as well as clinical applications in which our technology can be used to offer comprehensive sequencing and genotyping service solutions to clinicians and consumers in laboratory settings.Consumer Genomics MarketsNew sequencing and genotyping technologies, such as those developed by Illumina, are driving down the cost of performing these analyses, which we believe are increasingly valuable in diagnosing disease and evaluating disease risk.  6Table of ContentsConsumer genomics is a nascent market, but one we believe has the potential for high growth as the cost per analysis continues to drop.  In June 2009, we launched our Individual Genome Sequencing Service, the first physician-intermediated personal genome sequencing service for consumers.  Built around physician-patient consultation, the service requires a physician's order to initiate the process, with genome sequencing performed using our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory.  We have established collaborations with partners to perform the secondary data analysis of personal genomes (such as calculation of disease risk, ancestry, and information on traits of interest).  Some of our partners, as well as other companies in the direct-to-consumer market, use our genotyping technology and products to perform personal genotyping services.Our Principal TechnologiesOur unique technology platforms enable the scale of experimentation necessary for genome-wide discovery, target selection, and validation studies (see Figure 1 below).  More than 8,000 customer-authored scientific publications have been published to date using these technologies, representing the efforts of a large and dynamic Illumina user community.  Through rapid innovation, we believe we are changing the economics of genetic research, enabling projects once considered unapproachable now to be within reach of more investigators.  Figure 1: Illumina Platform Overview:  * Commercially available in the second half of 2012.Sequencing TechnologyDNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, or T) in a DNA sample.  Our HiSeq 2500/2000, HiSeq 1500/1000, Genome Analyzer IIx, MiSeq, and HiScanSQ systems represent a family of systems that we believe are setting the standard for productivity, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy among next-generation sequencing technologies.  They are used by customers to perform whole-genome, de novo, and targeted re-sequencing of genomes, and to analyze specific gene regions and genes.Whole-genome sequencing determines an organism's complete DNA sequence.  In de novo sequencing, the goal is to sequence a representative sample from a species never before sequenced.  In targeted re-sequencing, a sequence of nucleotide bases is compared to a standard or reference sequence from a previously sequenced species to identify changes that reflect genetic variation.  Understanding the similarities and differences in DNA sequence between and within species furthers our understanding of the function of the structures encoded in the DNA.Our DNA sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry, referred to as sequencing by synthesis (SBS) biochemistry.  In SBS, single stranded DNA is extended from a priming site, one base at a time, using reversible terminator nucleotides.  These are DNA bases that can be added to a growing second strand, but which initially cannot be further extended.  This means that at each cycle of the chemistry, only one base can be added.  Each base that is added includes a fluorescent label that is specific to the particular base (A, C, G, or T).  Following incorporation, the 7Table of Contentsemitted light can be imaged to determine its color and thus determine the base.  Once this is done, an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second strand.  This allows another base to be added, and the cycle can then be repeated.  Our technology is capable of generating over 600 billion bases of DNA sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation.  Key aspects of the SBS chemistry are the subject of significant intellectual property owned by us.In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on microscopic clusters of DNA.  Each cluster starts as a single DNA molecule fragment, typically a few hundred bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow cell.  We then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule.  As the copies are made, they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away.  After a number of cycles of amplification, each cluster might have approximately 1,000 copies of the original starting molecule, but still be only about a micron (one-millionth of a meter) in diameter.  By making so many copies, the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased.  Because the clusters are so small, hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell.  This large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of SBS biochemistry and fluorescent imaging.  Sequence reads are analyzed using specially developed data analysis software.With the ability to generate over 600 Gb of DNA sequence per run on our highest throughput sequencing instruments, the HiSeq 2500/2000, our SBS sequencing technology provides researchers with the broadest range of applications and the opportunity to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years.  Since the launch of our first Genome Analyzer in 2007, our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 100.BeadArray TechnologyOur BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously, enabling large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective, and flexible manner.  The arrays manufactured using BeadArray technology are imaged by our iScan, HiScan, and HiScanSQ systems for a broad range of DNA and RNA analysis applications including SNP discovery, SNP genotyping, CNV analysis, gene expression analysis, and methylation analysis. In the course of six years, we have increased the content capacity on a single array from 100,000 markers to 20 million markers.Our proprietary BeadArray technology consists of microscopic silica beads, with each bead covered with hundreds of thousands of copies of oligonucleotides, or oligos, that act as the capture sequences in one of our assays.  We deploy our BeadArray technology on BeadChips - silicon wafers the size of a microscope slide, with varying numbers of sample sites per slide.  BeadChips are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each sample site.We create unique bead pools, or sensors, for different DNA and RNA analysis applications by affixing thousands to millions of copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch.  We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule.  The particular molecules on a bead define that bead's function as a sensor.  To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells, one bead per well.  Because the beads assemble randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called “decoding” to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array.  We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, which is a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array.  One beneficial by-product of the decoding process is a functional validation of each bead in the array.  This quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells.  We ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type.  Multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads.An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA, and introducing it to the array.  The molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads.  The molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with fluorescent dye either before or after the binding, which can be detected by shining a laser on the BeadChip.  This allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample.Using our BeadArray technology, we achieve high-throughput analysis with a high density of test sites per array, and are able to format arrays in various configurations.  We seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive consumables and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies.  Our ability to vary the size, shape, and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments.  These features enable our BeadArray technology to be applied to high-growth markets of SNP genotyping and CNV analysis and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression 8Table of Contentsmarket.VeraCode TechnologyOur proprietary VeraCode technology is a detection method for multiplex assays that require high precision, accuracy, and speed.  When deployed on our BeadXpress Reader System, VeraCode technology provides a high-throughput solution for biomarker research and validation, pharmaceutical development, industrial and agriculture testing, clinical research, forensics, and molecular diagnostic assay development.  The VeraCode technology platform leverages the power of digital holographic codes to provide a detection method for multiplex assays.  VeraCode enables low-cost multiplexing from 1 to 384-plex in a single well.  The VeraCode technology consists of cylindrical glass beads (measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter) inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the multiplex reaction.  When excited by a laser, each VeraCode bead emits a unique code image, allowing for quick and specific detection by the BeadXpress Reader System.  Depending on the desired multiplex levels, assays are created by pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several hundred.  Unlike traditional microarrays, the VeraCode microbeads are used in solution, which takes advantage of solution-phase kinetics for more rapid hybridization times, dramatically reducing the time to achieve results.  Eco Real-Time PCR TechnologyIn 2010, we purchased Helixis, Inc. and its novel real-time PCR technology and introduced the Eco Real-Time PCR System to the market.  Real-Time PCR (also known as quantitative PCR or qPCR) is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted DNA molecule, with applications in gene expression, viral quantification, array data validation, pathogen detection, and genotyping.  The procedure follows the same steps as PCR, whereby thermal cycling (alternately heating and cooling the DNA sample from 20 to 40 times) causes the DNA to self-replicate, resulting in the doubling of DNA product with each cycle.  Real-time PCR uses various fluorescent detection chemistries to enable the monitoring of the PCR reaction as it progresses.  Data are collected at each cycle rather than at the end of the reaction, providing higher precision, increased sensitivity, increased dynamic range, and higher resolution.The Eco System combines a proprietary thermal system, four-color multiplex capabilities, and a fine-tuned optical system to deliver accurate qPCR results.  Its unique design provides superior thermal uniformity, supporting high-quality PCR performance for demanding applications such as high resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis used for SNP genotyping, DNA fingerprinting, species identification, HLA compatibility typing, allelic prevalence, and DNA methylation analysis.  Measuring just over one cubic foot in size, we believe the Eco System's overall performance rivals larger, more expensive systems.Our ProductsUsing our proprietary technologies, our products give our customers the ability to analyze the genome at any level of complexity, from whole-genome sequencing to low-multiplex assays, and enable us to serve a number of markets, including research, agriculture, forensics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular diagnostics.  The majority of our product sales consist of instruments and consumables (which include reagents, flow cells, and BeadChips) based on our proprietary technologies.  For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011, and January 3, 2010, instrument sales comprised 35%, 36%, and 34%, respectively, of total revenues, and consumable sales represented 56%, 56%, and 59%, respectively, of total revenues.Sequencing PlatformsBased on our proprietary SBS technology, our next-generation sequencing platforms are designed to meet the workflow, output, and accuracy demands of a full range of sequencing applications.  Designed for high-throughput (up to 600 Gb per run or up to 80 Gb per day) sequencing, the HiSeq 2000 is fast, easy-to-use, and cost-effective, generating the sequence of two human genomes at 30× coverage for less than $5,000 (USD) in consumable cost per genome.  Offering the same cost per data output and user experience, the HiSeq 1000 accommodates lower throughput needs, with an easy upgrade path to the HiSeq 2000.  Launched in 2011, our MiSeq Personal Sequencing System delivers the fastest time to an answer (as little as 2-3 hours following mid-2012 performance enhancements) and offers a breadth of sequencing applications in a compact and economical instrument to meet the needs of individual researchers.  In January 2012, we announced the HiSeq 2500 sequencing system, which will allow customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day (up to 120 Gb in 27 hours or 600 Gb 9Table of Contentsper run).  Commercial shipments of the HiSeq 2500 are expected to commence in the second half of 2012.Sequencing/Array Combination PlatformsThe HiScanSQ combines our SBS sequencing technology and HiScan microarray analysis instrumentation into one system, with a modular design that can evolve with changing research needs.  This flexible system allows researchers to use our sequencing and array technologies interactively to bring increased power to their experiments.  Array PlatformsThe HiScan and iScan Systems are dedicated array scanners that support the rapid, sensitive, and accurate imaging of our array-based genetic analysis products.  They incorporate high-performance lasers, optics, and detection systems, delivering sub-micron resolution and unmatched throughput rates.  The HiScan and iScan support our Infinium, GoldenGate, DASL, gene expression, and methylation assays.  Our BeadXpress Reader is designed for both small and high-throughput laboratories conducting molecular testing with multiplexed-based assays deployed on our VeraCode bead technology.  It supports a wide range of applications, including DNA, RNA, and protein-based assays, and is FDA cleared for in vitro diagnostics with specific VeraCode FDA-cleared tests.ConsumablesWe have developed a variety of sample preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis.  Some provide all the necessary consumables needed for analyses, such as our Standard Sequencing Kit (SBS chemistry on our sequencing platforms) and Infinium Assay Kit (array-based genotyping on our array platforms).  Others support more discrete analyses, such as our Paired-End Genomic DNA Sample Prep Kit for streamlining library preparation for the generation of 200-500 kb insert paired-end reads for sequencing, gene expression, and epigenetic analysis.  Our TruSeq SBS Sequencing Kit enhances sequencing studies with our HiSeq, Genome Analyzer IIx, and MiSeq systems, by enabling researchers to extend the read lengths, achieve higher Gb of mappable data, and deliver the highest yield of perfect reads to maximize the ability to accurately characterize the genome.  Through our acquisition of Epicentre Technologies Corporation in 2011, we acquired the proprietary Nextera technology for next-generation sequencing library preparation.  This technology has enabled us to offer sequencing library preparation kits with lower sample input requirements that greatly simplify genetic analysis workflows and significantly reduce the time from sample preparation to answer. Our InfiniumHD Whole-Genome BeadChips represent our most technologically advanced multi-sample DNA analysis microarrays, enabling the interrogation of up to approximately 5 million markers per sample, depending on the BeadChip.  The most recent additions to the Omni family, the HumanOmni5-Quad, the HumanOmni2.5, and the HumanOmni1S BeadChips, provide comprehensive coverage of common and rare variants identified by the 1000 Genomes Project for performing rich GWAS projects.  This product line also includes agriculturally relevant genome panels such as the BovineHD and MaizeSNP50 BeadChips.For researchers who want to study focused genomic regions of interest, or are interested in organisms for which there are no standard products, we offer iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChips.  Easily developed to fit any experimental design, these SNP genotyping arrays can be used to investigate from 3,000 to 1,000,000 markers targeting any species.  Real-time PCR PlatformsThe Eco Real-Time PCR System provides fast, accurate qPCR results.  Its icon-driven user interface simplifies experimental design and setup, while a straightforward workflow streamlines operation, enabling the system to perform qPCR on 48 samples in less than 40 minutes.  As our first entry into the qPCR market, we believe the smaller, lower-cost, full-featured Eco System will enable more scientists to use real-time PCR technology in their research. Our ServicesIn addition to the products we supply to customers, we also provide sequencing and genotyping services through our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory.  FastTrack ServicesOne of the ways in which we compete and extend the reach of our systems in the genetic analysis market is to deliver services that leverage our proprietary technologies and the expertise of our scientists to perform genotyping and sequencing 10Table of Contentsservices for our customers.  We began offering genotyping services to academic institutions, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical customers in 2002.  The in-house molecular geneticists that make up our FastTrack Genotyping team help customers perform GWAS projects, linkage analysis, and fine mapping studies to meet their deadlines, employing a range of our products, including standard and custom GoldenGate, standard Infinium and Infinium HD, and iSelect Infinium assays.  These projects range in size from a few hundred to over 10,000 samples.  After five years of building an infrastructure to support genotyping services, we expanded to deliver sequencing services in 2007.  We continue to combine the power of our proprietary SBS technology, with the consultative and analytical capabilities of our FastTrack Sequencing team to execute high-value projects such as whole-genome sequencing, targeted resequencing, digital expression profiling, and small RNA discovery.  Projects range from small sample sets requiring as little as one run, to large-scale projects such as de novo whole-genome sequencing that demand multiple instruments running in parallel for extended periods of time.  Service Partnership ProgramsTo complement our own service capabilities, we have developed partnered programs such as our Certified Service Providers (CSPro) and Illumina Genome Network (IGN), to create a world-wide network of Illumina technology-enabled service offerings that broaden our market reach.  Illumina CSPro is a collaborative service partnership established between Illumina and leading genome centers and research laboratories to ensure the delivery of high-quality genetic analysis services.  It provides a competitive advantage for service providers, while also ensuring that customers will receive Illumina data quality and service.  To become a CSPro provider, participating laboratories must complete a three-phased Illumina certification process.  There are over 65 Illumina CSPro-certified organizations worldwide providing sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression services using our technologies and products.Introduced in July 2010, the IGN links researchers interested in conducting large whole genome sequencing projects with leading institutes worldwide that possess our next-generation sequencing technology.  The IGN provides a cost-effective and dependable way to complete large sequencing projects.  All IGN partners are experienced and well-published using Illumina technology, and each has completed Illumina's Certified Service Provider (CSPro) certification.  Each IGN partner possesses ten or more Illumina sequencing systems (HiSeq 2000 systems and/or Genome Analyzers), providing the scalability to handle even the largest sequencing projects with rapid completion times.  Current members include: British Columbia Cancer Agency's Genome Science Centre, University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences, National Center for Genome Resources, Macrogen/Genomic Medicine Institute, and Illumina's own FastTrack Services.Individual Genome SequencingIntroduced in June 2009, Illumina's Individual Genome Sequencing Service provides personal genome sequencing for consumers.  It is performed in our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory using our next-generation sequencing technology.  The service is built around physician-patient consultation, with a physician's order required to initiate the process.  The offering includes sequencing of an individual's DNA to 30-times depth, providing information on SNP variation and other structural characteristics of the genome such as insertions, deletions, and rearrangements.  We are collaborating with a number of partners to provide secondary data analysis such as calculation of disease risk, ancestry, and information on traits of interest.  The service requires individuals to follow our physician-mediated process, which involves pre-service consultation, patient consent, and a seven-day “cooling off” period during which the patient may withdraw consent.  The final genome data is returned to the physician, who in turn delivers it to the consumer.Intellectual PropertyWe have an extensive intellectual property portfolio, including, as of February 1, 2012, ownership of, or exclusive licenses to, 235 issued U.S. patents and 173 pending U.S. patent applications, including 11 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents.  Our issued patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays, assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing technology, instruments, and chemical detection technologies, and have terms that expire between 2012 and 2030.  We continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies.  We have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries.We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright, and trademark protection, as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.  Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, to preserve our trade secrets, to enforce our patents, copyrights and trademarks, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.11Table of ContentsWe are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent kits, and scanning equipment.  We have exclusive licenses from Tufts University to patents that are directed to our BeadArray technology.  These patents were filed by Dr. David Walt, who is a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board, and one of our founders.  Our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents, which will occur between 2012 and 2020.  We have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products.  In most cases, the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be terminated at our request without further obligation, and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect.Research and DevelopmentWe have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception.  We have assembled a team of skilled scientists and engineers who are specialists in biology, chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems, software, manufacturing, and other related areas required to complete the development of our products.  Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize and support commercialization of the products and services derived from our technologies.Our research and development expenses for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009  were $196.9 million, $177.9 million, and $140.6 million, respectively.  We expect research and development expense to increase during 2012 as a result of the growth of our business and as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts.Marketing and DistributionOur current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving sequencing, SNP genotyping, and gene expression profiling.  These experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research, including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and animal and agricultural research.  Our potential customers include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agri-genomics, and consumer genomics companies.  The genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by, among other items: •the ability of the research community to extract medically valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;  •the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput research and analysis tools to enable the large amount of experimentation and analysis required to study genetic variation and biological function; and  •the availability of government and private industry funding to perform the research required to extract medically relevant information from genomic analysis.  We market and distribute our products directly to customers in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.  In each of these areas, we have dedicated sales, service, and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases.  In addition, in certain markets within Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products.  We expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2012 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products.ManufacturingWe manufacture sequencing and array platforms, reagent kits, scanning equipment, and oligos.  Our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2011 to support increased customer demand.  To continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products, we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process.  We adhere to access and safety standards required by federal, state, and local health ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances.Raw Materials12Table of ContentsOur manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and biochemical materials, and other supplies.  We have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies; however, there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single source suppliers.  To mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers, we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents, if required.  In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.CompetitionAlthough we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources, we expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression, and molecular diagnostics markets.  These include companies such as Affymetrix, Inc.; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Complete Genomics, Inc.; Helicos BioSciences Corporation; General Electric Company; Life Technologies Corporation; Luminex Corporation; Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.; QIAGEN N.V.; and Roche Diagnostics Corp., among others.  Some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution, and service organizations than we do.  In addition, they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems.  Each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase.  In order to effectively compete with these companies, we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost, and accuracy advantages over competing products.Segment and Geographic InformationIn accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting, we have determined that we have two operating segments for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results: Life Sciences and Diagnostics.  Our Life Sciences operating segment includes all products and services related to the research market, namely the product lines based on our sequencing, BeadArray, VeraCode, and real-time PCR technologies.  Our Diagnostics operating segment focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics.  During all periods presented, our Diagnostics operating segment had limited activity.  Accordingly, our financial results for both operating segments are reported on an aggregate basis as one reportable segment.  We will begin reporting in two operating segments once revenues, operating profit or loss, or assets of the Diagnostics operating segment exceed 10% of the consolidated amounts.We currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the United States, including customers in other areas of North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.  Shipments to customers outside the United States totaled $526.8 million, or 50% of our total revenue, during fiscal 2011, compared to $403.8 million, or 45%, and $319.1 million, or 48%, in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Sales to customers outside of the United States were generally denominated in U.S. dollars.  In 2008, we reorganized our international structure to establish more efficient channels among product development, product manufacturing, and sales.  The reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries' anticipated dependence on the U.S. entity for management decisions, financial support, production assets, and inventory thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the U.S. entity's operations.  As a result, we reassessed the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more U.S. dollar based, resulting in a U.S. dollar functional currency determination.  We expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue.  See note “15. Segment Information, Geographic Data, and Significant Customers” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations. BacklogOur backlog was $250.5 million and $299.0 million at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively.  Generally, our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date; however, we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products.  The timing of shipments depends on several factors including, agreed upon shipping schedules, which may span multiple quarters, and whether the product is catalog or custom.  We expect an estimated 90% of the backlog as of January 1, 2012 to be shipped within the fiscal year ending December 30, 2012.  Although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer, we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment.  SeasonalityHistorically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation, although demand for our 13Table of Contentsproducts is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result, in part, of U.S. academic customers spending unused budget allocations before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year on September 30 of each year.  During 2011, however, the U.S. government extended the timeframe over which the unused budget allocations could be utilized, which led to purchasing delays from some of our customers.  Environmental MattersWe are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment.  Our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.  We believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur.  In addition, we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the development of new laws and regulations, will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance. Government RegulationOur products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease.  However, as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, such as molecular diagnostic products, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will be a significant factor in the development, testing, production, and marketing of such products.  Products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending on their intended use, will be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a pre-market notification process, also known as a 510(k) clearance, or premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA prior to marketing.  Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.  The shorter 510(k) clearance process, which generally takes from three to six months after submission, but can take significantly longer, may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the FDA.  The longer PMA process is much more costly, uncertain, and generally takes from nine months to two years after filing.  Because we cannot be certain that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, or will ultimately be approved at all, the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated.  If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such products are used or could be used, even without our consent, for the diagnosis of disease.  If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.EmployeesAs of January 1, 2012, we had a total of approximately 2,200 employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We consider our employee relations to be positive.  Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.  In addition, we employ a number of temporary and contract employees.  We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities, and other organizations. ITEM 1A.Risk FactorsOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below.  In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price.We are subject to a takeover bid that may be disruptive to our business and threatens to adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.14Table of ContentsCKH Acquisition Corp. and Roche Holding Ltd. (together, “Roche”) have commenced an unsolicited hostile cash tender offer to purchase all of our outstanding common stock.  The Roche tender offer is subject to numerous conditions, some of which are at the discretion of Roche.  Roche also announced that it intends to oppose the re-election of four directors serving on our board of directors whose terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, including the Chairman of the Board and our Chief Executive Officer.  In connection with the Roche tender offer, four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed against us, and we anticipate that additional lawsuits may be filed.  Responding to the Roche tender offer, the adverse proxy solicitation, and the lawsuits may be a major distraction for management and may require us to incur significant costs.  Moreover, the hostile and unsolicited nature of the offer may disrupt our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees, producers, suppliers, customers, and other constituencies important to our success, which could negatively impact our financial results and business initiatives.  We believe the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on many factors, including uncertainty associated with the unsolicited offer by Roche.Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.  These provisions include our Preferred Shares Rights Agreement (“Rights Agreement”), commonly known as a “poison pill” and provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation that give our Board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval.  The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control.  One of the conditions of the Roche tender offer is the removal or amendment of our Rights Agreement such that Roche’s acquisition of our stock would not trigger the provisions of the Rights Agreement.  To date, our board has not agreed to such removal or amendment.  In addition, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), including Section 203 of the DGCL, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of Illumina.  Section 203 of the DGCL provides, with certain exceptions, for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15% and less than 85% of the voting stock (exclusive of stock held by directors, officers, and employee plans) of a company.The above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of Illumina, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock.Reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue.A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, and consumer genomics companies, and their capital spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services.  These budgets are based on a wide variety of factors, including the allocation of available resources to make purchases, funding from government sources, the spending priorities among various types of research equipment, and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods.  Any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our revenue.  Moreover, we have no control over the timing and amount of purchases by our customers, and, as a result, revenue from these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast.  Any delay or reduction in purchases by our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results.The timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the United States and Europe, in particular, focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slowing economic growth.  Research funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries.  Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.  Other programs, such as defense, entitlement programs, or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority.  These budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government 15Table of Contentsagencies that fund research and development activities, such as the U.S. National Institute of Health, or NIH.  Past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced NIH and other research and development allocations.  Any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We face intense competition, which could render our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions, or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell.We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture, and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide-range of competing technologies.  We anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies.  One or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established customer base, and more experience in research and development than we do.  Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could also develop competing products.  We believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product; therefore, it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors.  To the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products, our competitive position may suffer.The market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share, intellectual property portfolios, and regulatory expertise.  Established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories, which could deter acceptance of our products.  In addition, some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests.If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including Jay Flatley, our President and Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.  The hostile and unsolicited nature of the Roche offer coupled with Roche's efforts to oppose the re-election of Mr. Flatley to our board of directors at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders may adversely affect our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees.  In addition, the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing, sales, marketing, and technical support.  We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities, and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.  Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Diego and San Francisco area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high.  Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies.  Additionally, integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive, causing key employees of the acquired business to leave.  Further, we use stock options and restricted stock units to provide incentives for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests with those of the Company by building long-term stockholder value.  If our stock price decreases, the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee's incentive to stay.  Our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function.We design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences, diagnostic, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries.  The usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease.  We are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression profiling.  These markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full potential.  Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing.  Also, researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information.  For instance, demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation, such as SNPs, and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies.  In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business.  If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our 16Table of Contentsproducts may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to sustain profitability.If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations, then our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted.In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products.  Because our instruments and consumables are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services.  Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities.  In addition, identifying the root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting reagents and third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur.  Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive, and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls, and warranty or other service obligations.  In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new products.Our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, existing and emerging competition, strong price competition, and frequent new product introductions.  Accordingly, our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services, including improving our existing products and services, in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis.  If we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies, our products and services will become dated, and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors.  We believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made.To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products, or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development, we may lose market share to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible to regain.  An inability, for technological or other reasons, to develop successfully and timely introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.  In the past, we have experienced, and are likely to experience in the future, delays in the development and introduction of new products.  There can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace, achieve market acceptance, or compete successfully with competing technologies.  Some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include:•availability, quality, and price relative to competing products and services;•the functionality and performance of new and existing products and services;•the timing of introduction of new products or services relative to competing products and services;•scientists' and customers' opinions of the utility of new products or services;•citation of new products or services in published research;•regulatory trends and approvals; and •general trends in life sciences research and applied markets.We may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace.If we do not successfully manage the development, manufacturing, and launch of new products or services, including product transitions, our financial results could be adversely affected.We face risks associated with launching new products and pre-announcing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested.  If our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results 17Table of Contentsexpected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer.  If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle, we may delay the product launch date.  In addition, we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions, purchasing decisions, or transition requirements or programs (such as trade-in programs) with respect to newly launched products (or products in development) relative to our existing products, which could adversely affect sales of our existing products.  The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials used in our products, and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted, or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all.The complex nature of our products requires customized, precision-manufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources, and, in the case of some components and materials, from only a single source.  If deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities, or at all, in order to meet demand for our products.  We may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier.  The time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources, or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results.  Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all.  In addition, the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements.  Current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues, such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products, could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs.  Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.If we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all.We continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products.  Although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans, there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities, and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner.  For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products.  Also, we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand, especially as we introduce new products.  As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator, and internal demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline.  Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products.  Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments, consumables, and products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products (or to produce them economically), prevent us from achieving expected performance levels, or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.Additionally, we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations.  Our manufacturing facilities are located in San Diego and Hayward, California; Singapore; and Little Chesterford, United Kingdom.  These areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods.  If a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our services, or develop new products.Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our custom-designed laboratory information management system (LIMS).  Additionally, the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure.  If either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us 18Table of Contentsfrom achieving our expected shipments in any given period.Our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products, services, and technologies, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of technologies, products, or businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:•difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;•lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;•difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;•underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;•negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;•the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;•claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;•the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;•diversion of management's attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;•inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;•the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies; and•assumption of, or exposure to, unknown contingent liabilities or liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify.In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies.  There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable.  Our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.Any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position.Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries.  If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the United States.  These challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the United States.The proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences, genomics, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries, including our proprietary position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.  We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.  We intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate.  However, our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued.  Questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise.  Any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies, which may not be available on 19Table of Contentsfavorable terms, if at all.  Furthermore, as issued patents expire, we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products, and, as a result, we may lose revenue.In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage.  We may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive, and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.  Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. There is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies.  In that regard, certain patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months.We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and we have taken security measures to protect this information.  These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other confidential information.  Among other things, we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators, and consultants.  There can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees, collaborators, and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.  Accordingly, there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.Litigation, other proceedings, or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services.Our success depends, in part, on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties.  Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.  As we enter new markets or introduce new products, we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition.  In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents.  We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims.  Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself.  Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop further, commercialize, or sell products or services, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us.  In the event of a successful infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products or services.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all.  We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins.  In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.  Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability.Our products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease.  However, as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable agencies of other countries, including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed.  Such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.  In addition, changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the FDA following a pre-market notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing.  Obtaining the requisite 20Table of Contentsregulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.  If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such products are used or could be used, even without our consent, for the diagnosis of disease.  If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business.Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources.  If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively, including the risks noted below, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.  We are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets. We have sales offices located internationally throughout Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Brazil, as well as manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Singapore.  During 2011, the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in U.S. dollars.  Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 50%, 45%, and 48% of our total revenue for the years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011, and January 3, 2010, respectively.  We intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the United States and we expect the total amount of non-U.S. sales to continue to grow.International sales entail a variety of risks, including: •longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States;•longer sales cycles due to the volume of transactions taking place through public tenders;•currency exchange fluctuations; •challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations; •tariffs and other trade barriers; •unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we sell our products;•difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays; and•significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations.  Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market.  Our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive, impacting our ability to compete.  Our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency.  Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations.  The recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes.We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes.  Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of non-deductible expenses (including share-based compensation), changes in our future levels of research and development spending, mergers and acquisitions, or the result of examinations by various tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the IRS or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the Company on its tax returns, we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties.  If 21Table of Contentsmaterial, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.In addition, we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible notes if these notes are not subject to the special Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments, the notes are converted, or we invest in non-taxable investments.An inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our business has grown rapidly, with total revenues increasing from $73.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2006 to $1,055.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2012 and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to approximately 2,200 during the same period.  We expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans.  The continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems.  Our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial, and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis.  If we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology.  Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research, product development, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and customer support programs, enhance our operational and financial control systems, expand, train, and manage our employee base, integrate acquired businesses, and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully, and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, and we may not be able to sustain operating profitability.Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and services, the effects of new product launches and related promotions, the timing and availability of our customers' funding, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns.  Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.  While we anticipate future growth, there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis.  This is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear, with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter.  In light of that, our revenue cut-off and recognition procedures, together with our manufacturing and shipping operations, may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter.A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel.  In addition, we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars, and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products.  Accordingly, our ability to sustain profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses, and if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability.  Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.  In addition, non-cash share-based compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability.  Due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, particularly from quarter to quarter, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.  If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue.  The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales.  As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.22Table of ContentsChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments.  Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.Ethical, legal, and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products or services.Our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans, agricultural crops, and other living organisms.  The information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications, which may have underlying ethical, legal, and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information, including the genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions.  Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure.  Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible.  These and other ethical, legal, and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our strategic equity investments may result in losses.We periodically make strategic equity investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business.  The market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control.  Other-than-temporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses in proportion to our ownership interest.  This could result in future charges to our earnings.  It is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long-term benefits associated with these strategic investments.Conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses. As of January 1, 2012, we had $40 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2014 and $920 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 outstanding.  The notes are convertible into cash, and if applicable, shares of our common stock under certain circumstances, including trading price conditions related to our common stock.  If the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of $21.83 per share with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and $83.55 with respect to convertible notes due 2016, we expect that the noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes.  Upon conversion, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value.  The fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate. The net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 8.3% with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and 4.5% with respect to convertible notes due 2016.  If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes, we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted.
