ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSEach of the following risks should be carefully considered, along with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these risks to be the principal ones we face and of which we are currently aware. Some of the risks described below relate to our operations, while others relate to residual risks from our Separation from ITT Corporation in 2011 ("the Spin-off"). Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.Should any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.Risks Related to Our OperationsFailure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business.We provide products and services into competitive markets. We believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance, reliability and innovation, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. Failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements.Our business relies on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, nickel, copper, aluminum, and plastics. We are exposed to the availability of these materials, which may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, interruptions in production by suppliers, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, ability to meet regulatory requirements, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Our strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully.Our historical growth has included acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies, assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business. We cannot make assurances, however, that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot make assurances that any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow.Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations; integration of technology, operations personnel, and financial and other systems; potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis; the failure to realize expected synergies; the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses.16Our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases.Our operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, and cost of labor. In order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. Further, our ability to realize financial benefits from Six Sigma and Lean projects may not be able to mitigate fully or in part these manufacturing and operating cost increases and, as a result, could negatively impact our profitability.Our ability to successfully manage our restructuring and realignment actions could impact our business results.We expect to incur approximately $60 to $70 million of restructuring and realignment costs in 2013, including costs related to the establishment of a European headquarters and management structure to better align Xylem to serve our customers and address market opportunities as well as optimize our cost base. Successfully executing and managing these actions, including establishing the most effective organizational structures and the retention of key employees, is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace.  Other factors that may impede an effective restructuring and realignment include the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions.  If this organizational redesign is not executed successfully, the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted.Changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results.We sell our products in more than 150 countries and approximately 63% of our revenue was generated outside the United States in 2012. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes;•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•sustainability of historical income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in deferred tax valuation allowances.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.Product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Manufacturing or design defects in (including in products or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury, death or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business.We operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries considered to have a high risk of corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws. We are subject, however, to the risk that we or our affiliated entities or our representatives or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, may take action determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and others. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, 17investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.We may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings.We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those related to antitrust, environmental, product, and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the United States, any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation. Changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses, including acquisitions and divestitures. Some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters, intellectual property matters, product liability and personal injury claims, employment, labor and pension matters, and government and commercial or contract issues, sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures. We may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate. Additionally, we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.Our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology, communications networks and operations.Our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks, and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources. Regardless of protection measures, essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure, vandalism, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters, power outages and other events. In addition, cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, among others, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. We also have a concentration of operations on certain sites, e.g. production and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. Transport of goods from suppliers, and to customers, could also be hampered for the reasons stated above. Although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls, and perform business continuity planning, we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.Risks Related to LiquidityOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility.As of December 31, 2012, our total outstanding indebtedness was $1,205 million including our 3.55% Senior Notes of $600 million aggregate principal amount due September 2016 and 4.875% Senior Notes of $600 million aggregate principal amount due October 2021. We have an existing Four Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”), which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million.  Additionally, effective December 14, 2012, we entered into a Risk Sharing Finance Facility Agreement (the "R&D Facility Agreement") with The European Investment Bank ("EIB") in an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million (approximately $158 million). Our indebtedness could:•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds;•limit our ability to pay future dividends;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•require that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and18•increase the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates, which, as interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense.In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, the amount of our stock that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our stock may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for ITT under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and under the Tax Matters Agreement entered into by ITT in connection with the Spin-off (the “Tax Matters Agreement”), we could be required to indemnify ITT for that tax.Our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.Risks Related to External FactorsOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions.We compete around the world in various geographic and product markets. In 2012, 37% and 35% of our total revenue was from customers located in the United States and Europe, respectively. We expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future. Important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macro-economic conditions; industrial and federal, state, local and municipal governmental spending; the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; interest rates; availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; and unemployment rates. A slowdown or downturn in these financial or macro-economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business.In 2012, 63% of our total revenue was from customers outside the United States. We expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. Both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include the following:•possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;•currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;•potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;•disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;•changes in tariff and trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements; and•insurrection or war.Any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. In addition to the general risks that we face outside the United States, we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past, which could involve additional uncertainties for us, including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds; governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. In addition, emerging 19markets pose other uncertainties, including the protection of our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products, and risks of political instability. We cannot predict the impact such future, largely unforeseeable events might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swedish Krona, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Polish Zloty, and Hungarian Forint. Any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar or Euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results. Weather conditions, particularly heavy flooding and droughts, can positively or negatively impact portions of our business. Within the dewatering space, our pumps provided through our Godwin brand are used to remove excess or unwanted water. Heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications. On the other hand, drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications, such as those provided by our Goulds Water Technology, Flowtronex and Lowara brands. Given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions, this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.The level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.Certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable, including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases. Management develops each assumption using relevant plan and Company experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. Our liquidity, financial position (including shareholders’ equity) and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, actuarial experience, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.We make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employee-related benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.Unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our operations are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures.Environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations.Developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.20Risks Relating to Our Common StockThe following are risks in connection with ownership of our common stock:There is a limited market history for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;•success or failure of our business strategy;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•our ability to obtain financing as needed;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;•natural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;•overall market fluctuations;•fluctuations in the budgets of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;•results from any material litigation or government investigation;•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business; and•general economic conditions and other external factors.Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.We cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends.Additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt-payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend. There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.Certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition part or all of our business operations For example, the amended and 21restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated by-laws, among other things, provide for a classified board of directors and require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, do not permit shareholders to convene special meetings and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders. In addition, the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us, as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of “control shares” of an “issuing public corporation.”Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition (including issuance) of Xylem common stock or any other transaction (or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction) that could cause the Spin-off to be taxable to ITT. We have also agreed to indemnify ITT for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, ITT will recognize taxable gain on the Spin-off if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our capital stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding capital stock, and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Spin-off. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the Spin-off (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.Risks Related to our 2011 Separation from ITT CorporationIf the Spin-off were to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Internal Revenue Code, then we and/or our former parent and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability.In connection with the Spin-off, we and our former parent, ITT Corporation, received an IRS ruling (the “IRS Ruling”) stating that ITT and its shareholders will not recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spin-off. In addition, ITT received an opinion of tax counsel as to the satisfaction of certain requirements necessary for the Spin-off to receive tax-free treatment upon which the IRS did not rule. The IRS Ruling, while generally binding upon the IRS, was based on certain factual statements and representations. If any such factual statements or representations were incomplete or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts on which the IRS Ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the Spin-off, the IRS could modify or revoke the IRS Ruling retroactively.As discussed above, certain requirements for tax-free treatment that are not covered in the IRS Ruling were addressed in the opinion of counsel. The opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. Like the IRS Ruling, the opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter counsel’s conclusions.If all or a portion of the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction because any of the factual statements or representations in the IRS Ruling or the legal opinion are incomplete or untrue, or because the facts upon which the IRS Ruling is based were materially different from the facts at the time of the Spin-off, ITT would recognize a substantial gain for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations each member of the ITT consolidated group at the time of the Spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries), would be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any resulting U.S. Federal income tax liability.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Spin-off will be taxable to ITT (but not to ITT shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either us or ITT, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Spin-off. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the Spin-off (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The tax liability resulting from the application of Section 355(e) would be substantial. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the ITT consolidated group at the time of the Spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. Federal income tax liability.We have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the Spin-off to be taxable to ITT, including under Section 355(e). Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2011 among ITT, 22Exelis and Xylem, we have also agreed to indemnify ITT and Exelis for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions, and ITT and Exelis have agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by ITT or Exelis. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company.We may be unable to achieve all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-off.As an independent, publicly traded company, we believe that our business will benefit from, among other things, (i) greater strategic focus of financial resources and management’s efforts, (ii) enhanced customer focus, (iii) direct and differentiated access to capital resources, (iv) enhanced investor choices by offering investment opportunities in a separate entity from ITT, (v) improved management incentive tools, and (vi) utilization of stock as an acquisition currency. However, as a result of separating from ITT, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been as a part of ITT. In addition, we may not be able to achieve all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all.We have a limited operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.Certain historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report has been prepared on a “carve-out” basis from ITT’s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. ITT did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity or segment for all the periods presented. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations and financial position will be in the future. While we were profitable as part of ITT, we cannot assume that as a stand-alone company our profits will continue at a similar level.The Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.The Spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the Spin-off left us, ITT and/or Exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we, ITT and/or Exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature and that ITT did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require the return of assets or our shares to ITT, voiding the liens of Xylem and claims against ITT, or providing ITT with a claim for money damages against us.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, ITT or Exelis were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off.The Spin-off could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Indiana Business Corporation Law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. No assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution of our shares in connection with the Spin-off was unlawful.Under the Distribution Agreement, from and after the Spin-off, we will be responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate following the consummation of the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by ITT or Exelis should ITT or Exelis fail to pay or perform its retained obligations (for example, tax, asbestos and/or environmental liabilities).23In connection with our separation, ITT and Exelis will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify ITT or Exelis for certain liabilities. If we are required to indemnify ITT or Exelis, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In the case of ITT’s or Exelis’s indemnity, there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or as to ITT’s or Exelis’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with ITT and Exelis, ITT and Exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ITT and Exelis for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT and Exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ITT or Exelis has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from ITT and Exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT and Exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from ITT and Exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 1B
