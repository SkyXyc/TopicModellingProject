Risk Factors
 Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business
may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  Risks Relating to the Proposed Biomet
Merger and the Combined Company Following the Merger  The following risk factors relate to certain risks and
uncertainties associated with the pending Biomet merger

 
and the combined company following the merger. The following discussion does not, however, contain all risks and uncertainties that relate to Biomet and its business on a standalone basis, which
additional risks and uncertainties may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the Biomet merger. 
There is no assurance when or if the merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the merger may substantially reduce the benefits
that we expect to obtain from the merger.  Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions. There can be no assurance that we and LVB will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our control will be satisfied or waived. We and LVB can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement, even
though LVB stockholders have approved the merger, and we and LVB can also terminate the merger agreement under other specified circumstances. If the merger and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are not completed within the
expected timeframe, such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger and could result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated
with uncertainty about the merger.  We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of
Biomet.  We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of Biomet. There are a
large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits. While we expect to
incur integration and restructuring costs following completion of the merger in 2015 that are estimated to exceed $400 million in the first two years post-merger, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate
accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the
realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or
at all.  We and LVB may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger. 
Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other conditions, the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the approval of the European Commission and the receipt of approval or expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
laws of Japan. We and LVB are pursuing all required consents, orders and approvals in accordance with the merger agreement. These consents,

orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to our or Biomet’s divisions, operations or assets, or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place
restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business. The merger agreement requires us and LVB, among other things, to accept all such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that may be imposed by
regulatory entities. Such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger, may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or may result in the abandonment of the merger.
Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions
are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals.  The
pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on our and/or Biomet’s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The pendency of the merger could disrupt our and/or Biomet’s businesses in the following ways, among others: 


•
 
 our and/or Biomet’s employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the combined company, which might adversely affect our
and/or Biomet’s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel; 


•
 
 the attention of our and/or Biomet’s management may be directed towards the completion of the merger and other transaction-related considerations
and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of us and/or Biomet, as applicable, and matters related to the merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might
have been beneficial to us and/or Biomet, as applicable; and 


•
 
 customers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us and/or Biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to
terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or Biomet as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us and/or Biomet or otherwise. 
Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the financial condition, results of operations or business
prospects of, us and/or Biomet.  Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our future business and financial
results.  If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. We will be subject to several
risks, including the following: 


•
 
 having to pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees; and



•
 
 focusing our management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us and our stockholders, without
realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed.

 We cannot assure you that, if the merger is not completed, these risks will not materialize
and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial results.  Successful integration of Biomet with us and
successful operation of the combined company are not assured. Also, integrating our business with that of Biomet may divert the attention of management away from operations. 
If the merger is completed, Biomet will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours, but will initially continue its operations on
a basis that is separate from our operations. There can be no assurance that after the merger Biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. In addition, the market segments in which Biomet operates may experience declines in
demand and/or new competitors. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of Biomet with ours will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process will be time-consuming and
expensive, will disrupt the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us and Biomet, including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative
functions. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include: 


•
 
 managing a larger combined company; 


•
 
 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; 


•
 
 issues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces; 


•
 
 difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel; 


•
 
 loss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers; 


•
 
 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; 


•
 
 incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and 


•
 
 unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or Biomet’s business. 
Additionally, the integration of our and Biomet’s operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and
other internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm the combined company’s business, financial condition and operating results.
 We will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt
obligations.  In connection with the merger, we entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement and a $4.35 billion
bank credit agreement. Proceeds from the bank credit agreement and the anticipated issuance by us of up to $7.66 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (or, if senior unsecured notes are not issued and sold prior to the
closing date of the merger, drawings under the bridge credit agreement) will be used to finance, in part, the cash consideration for the merger, pay fees and the expenses incurred in connection with the merger and pay off all of

Biomet’s funded debt. Our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $1.43 billion and, immediately after the completion of the merger, the combined company’s debt
is anticipated to be approximately $12.09 billion. As of December 31, 2014, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months would, in the absence of the
merger, have been approximately $64.0 million. As a result of the increase in debt related to the merger, demands on the combined company’s cash resources will increase after the completion of the merger. The increased level of debt could,
among other things: 


•
 
 require the combined company to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of its debt, thereby reducing
funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements; 


•
 
 limit the combined company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development
expenditures and other general corporate requirements; 


•
 
 limit the combined company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which we operate;



•
 
 restrict the combined company’s ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;



•
 
 place the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; 


•
 
 adversely affect the combined company’s credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing the combined company’s indebtedness might
increase and its ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired; 


•
 
 adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and 


•
 
 limit the combined company’s ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.
 If we are unable to obtain alternate financing through senior unsecured notes, it is unlikely that we will
be able to repay the outstanding amounts under the bridge loan at maturity on the 364th day after completion of the merger. Any debt incurred to refinance the bridge loan may be on unfavorable terms. 
The merger may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
 Although we anticipate that the merger will have an immediate accretive impact on the combined company’s adjusted
earnings per share, this expectation is based on factors that may not be realized and estimates that may materially change. We could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors, such as the failure to realize all of the
benefits anticipated to result from the merger. In addition, we expect that LVB stockholders and holders of LVB equity-based awards immediately prior to the merger will own, in the aggregate, approximately 16% of our outstanding shares after the
merger, based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock on December 31, 2014. Once

 
additional shares are issued in the merger, the combined company’s earnings per share may be lower than our adjusted earnings per share would have been in the absence of the merger. All of
these factors could cause dilution to earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger, and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any increase in adjusted earnings
per share will occur, even over the long term. Any increase in adjusted earnings per share as a result of the merger is likely to require us, among other things, to successfully manage the combined company’s operations to increase our
consolidated earnings after the merger.  Risks Relating to Our Business Regardless of Whether the Proposed Biomet Merger is
Consummated  Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our
competitors.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or
uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies.
Competition is primarily on the basis of: 


•
 
 technology; 


•
 
 innovation; 


•
 
 quality; 


•
 
 reputation; and 


•
 
 customer service.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including: 


•
 
 local distribution systems; 


•
 
 complex regulatory environments; and 


•
 
 differing medical philosophies and product preferences.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our competitors may: 


•
 
 have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us; 


•
 
 respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; 


•
 
 undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; 


•
 
 adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or 


•
 
 be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. 
Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
 If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers
may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.  Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad
depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’
detailed knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

 If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete
over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.  Demand for our products may
change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of: 


•
 
 evolving customer needs; 


•
 
 changing demographics; 


•
 
 slowing industry growth rates; 


•
 
 declines in the reconstructive implant market; 


•
 
 the introduction of new products and technologies; 


•
 
 evolving surgical philosophies; and 


•
 
 evolving industry standards.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new
product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 


•
 
 properly identify and anticipate customer needs; 


•
 
 commercialize new products in a timely manner; 


•
 
 manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time; 


•
 
 differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings; 


•
 
 achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products; 


•
 
 satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost
procedures; 


•
 
 innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and 


•
 
 provide adequate medical education relating to new products.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors: 


•
 
 entrenched patterns of clinical practice; 


•
 
 the need for regulatory clearance; and 


•
 
 uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to
fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they
may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be
harmed.  We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which
receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may

 
deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an
unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.  In addition,
third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other
healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. 
We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. If key
participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The U.S. healthcare reform law includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of
2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), was signed into law in March 2010 and mandates health insurance coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. As part of the Affordable Care Act, in January 2013
we began paying a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our U.S sales. We continue to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax. We have not been able to pass along the cost
of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act and other legislation. Nor have we been able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion
of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population. The medical device excise tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with
the excise tax statute. In addition, without the implementation of proper safeguards, the Affordable Care Act’s Medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, could provide additional incentives for
healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products. Accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the
Affordable Care Act on our business, ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group

purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing
organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group
purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our
failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. 
We are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products,
non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The medical
devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be
costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in
substantial additional costs.  Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under
FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including the Quality System regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is
monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not
in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a
recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and
others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical
devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from
effectively marketing and

 
selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
In 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining
to Trilogy Acetabular System products manufactured at our Ponce, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. As of December 31, 2014, the warning letter remains pending. Until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional
regulatory action by the FDA, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Additional information regarding this and other FDA regulatory matters can be found in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements (See Part II, Item 8 of this report). 
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.  If we fail to comply
with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the
federal Stark law, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S.,
exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid
change.  We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business
risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.  We sell our products in more than 100 countries
and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2014 from outside the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with
international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: 


•
 
 changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; 


•
 
 unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; 


•
 
 differing local product preferences and product requirements; 


•
 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 


•
 
 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;

•
 
 trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our
operating costs; 


•
 
 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; 


•
 
 complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; 


•
 
 extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 


•
 
 effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act; 


•
 
 difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; 


•
 
 labor force instability; 


•
 
 potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

 political and economic instability.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
 We may have additional tax liabilities.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that
determination is made.  We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of
funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on
foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. 
We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to
decline and expose us to counterparty risks.  A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and
Japan. The U.S. Dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well as other currencies, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may
not prove to be fully effective. 
 Pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.  Our business exposes us to
potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing
flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As previously reported, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the
Durom® Acetabular Component (Durom Cup) and certain products within the NexGen Knee System.
The majority of the Durom Cup cases are pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the District of New Jersey (In Re: Zimmer Durom Hip Cup Products Liability Litigation) and the majority of the NexGen Knee System cases are
pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the Northern District of Illinois (In Re: Zimmer NexGen Knee Implant Products Liability Litigation). We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims
related to various other products. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could
have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.  Although we
maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. Furthermore, even if any product
liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits.
Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in
our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others. 
Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our
industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it
is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future
products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights

against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual
property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, our currently
pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid,
unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not
be available on reasonable terms or at all.  In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect
in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue. 
We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures,
including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes. 
In addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and
claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could
in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be
adversely affected.  We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and
infrastructure. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations,

 
changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our
information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information
technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In addition, third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data
relating to patients or our proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in
determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, have regulatory sanctions or
penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information
technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will
be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating
results.  Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisition activity and
represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be
recoverable. If the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our
businesses decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would
negatively affect our results of operations.  We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and
outsourced activities.  We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to
outsource some key manufacturing activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be
obtained from a

single source or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
our ability to satisfy demand for our products.  The “conflict minerals” rule may adversely affect the sourcing,
availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, may increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to the SEC’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. We filed a report on Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters on June 2, 2014 and are required

 
to file on an annual basis going forward. This rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely
affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. In addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. We have a
complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. As a result, we may face reputational challenges with our
customers and other stakeholders.
