    Risk
    Factors





 


    The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial position or results of operations and
    could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
    These risk factors may not include all of the important factors
    that could affect our business or our industry or that could
    cause our future financial results to differ materially from
    historic or expected results or cause the market price of our
    common stock to fluctuate or decline.


 


    OUR ACQUISITION OF MERCK GENERICS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF
    INTEGRATION RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
    EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Our acquisition of Merck Generics involves a number of
    integration risks, such as:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    difficulties in successfully integrating the facilities,
    operations and personnel of Merck Generics with our historical
    business and corporate culture;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating
    synergies;




 



     
        • 

    
    diversion of management’s attention from our ongoing
    business concerns to integration matters;




 



     
        • 

    
    the potential loss of key personnel or customers;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties in consolidating information technology platforms
    and corporate infrastructure;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties in transitioning the Merck Generics business and
    products from the “Merck” name to achieve a global
    brand alignment;




 



     
        • 

    
    our substantial indebtedness and assumed liabilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    the incurrence of significant additional capital expenditures,
    transaction and operating expenses and non-recurring
    acquisition-related charges;




 



     
        • 

    
    challenges in operating in other markets outside of the United
    States that are new to us; and




 



     
        • 

    
    unanticipated effects of export controls, exchange rate
    fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions or
    domestic and foreign economic conditions.





 


    These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete,
    require us to focus additional resources on integration of
    operations rather than other profitable areas, or otherwise
    cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause a decline in
    the market value of our common stock.


 


    WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS, GROWTH
    OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER BENEFITS ANTICIPATED FROM THE
    ACQUISITIONS OF MERCK GENERICS AND A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN
    MATRIX.


 


    The success of the acquisitions of Merck Generics and a
    controlling interest in Matrix will depend, in part, on our
    ability to realize anticipated cost savings, revenue synergies
    and growth opportunities from integrating the historical
    businesses of Mylan, Merck Generics and Matrix. We expect to
    benefit from operational cost savings resulting from the
    consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as
    well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and market
    integration.


 


    There is a risk, however, that the historical businesses of
    Mylan, Merck Generics and Matrix may not be combined in a manner
    that permits these costs savings or synergies to be realized in
    the time currently expected, or at all. This may limit or delay
    our ability to integrate the companies’ manufacturing,
    research and development, marketing, organizations, procedures,
    policies and operations. In addition, a variety of factors,
    including, but not limited to, wage inflation and currency
    fluctuations, may adversely affect our anticipated cost savings
    and revenues.


 


    Also, we may be unable to achieve our anticipated cost savings
    and synergies without adversely affecting our revenues. If we
    are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the
    anticipated benefits of these acquisitions may not be realized
    fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
    These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete,
    require us to focus additional resources on integration of
    operations rather than other profitable areas, or otherwise
    cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause a decline in
    the market value of our common stock.


 


    WE HAVE GROWN AT A VERY RAPID PACE. OUR INABILITY TO PROPERLY
    MANAGE OR SUPPORT THIS GROWTH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
    ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO
    DECLINE.

    We have grown very rapidly over the past few years, through our
    acquisitions of Merck Generics and a controlling interest in
    Matrix. This growth has put significant demands on our
    processes, systems and people. We expect to make significant
    investments in additional personnel, systems and internal
    control processes to help manage our growth. Attracting,
    retaining and motivating key employees in various departments
    and locations to support our growth is critical to our business,
    and competition for these people can be intense. If we are
    unable to hire and retain qualified employees and if we do not
    continue to invest in systems and processes to manage and
    support our rapid growth, there may be a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial position and results of operations,
    and the market value of our common stock could decline.


 


    OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF MERCK
    GENERICS AND A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN MATRIX EXPOSES US TO
    ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
    OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
    COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    With our recently completed acquisitions of Merck Generics and a
    controlling interest in Matrix, our operations extend to
    numerous countries outside the United States. Operating globally
    exposes us to certain additional risks including, but not
    limited to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    compliance with a variety of national and local laws of
    countries in which we do business, including restrictions on the
    import and export of certain intermediates, drugs and
    technologies;




 



     
        • 

    
    fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions conducted in
    currencies other than the functional currency;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse changes in the economies in which we operate as a result
    of a slowdown in overall growth, a change in government or
    economic liberalization policies, or financial, political or
    social instability in such countries that affects the markets in
    which we operate, particularly emerging markets;




 



     
        • 

    
    wage increases or rising inflation in the countries in which we
    operate;




 



     
        • 

    
    natural disasters, including drought, floods and earthquakes in
    the countries in which we operate; and




 



     
        • 

    
    communal disturbances, terrorist attacks, riots or regional
    hostilities in the countries in which we operate.





 


    We also face the risk that some of our competitors have more
    experience with operations in such countries or with
    international operations generally. Certain of the above factors
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause a decline in
    the market value of our common stock.


 


    OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY ARE DEPENDENT
    UPON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP
    AND/OR
    LICENSE, OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A
    TIMELY BASIS IN RELATION TO OUR COMPETITORS’ PRODUCT
    INTRODUCTIONS. OUR FAILURE TO DO SO SUCCESSFULLY COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
    TO DECLINE.


 


    Our future revenues and profitability will depend, to a
    significant extent, upon our ability to successfully develop
    and/or
    license, or otherwise acquire and commercialize, new generic and
    patent or statutorily protected pharmaceutical products in a
    timely manner. Product development is inherently risky,
    especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not
    been established and the market is not yet proven. Likewise,
    product licensing involves inherent risks including
    uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of
    milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual
    disagreements with regard to terms such as license scope or
    termination rights. The development and commercialization
    process, particularly with regard to new drugs, also requires
    substantial time, effort and financial resources. We, or a
    partner, may not be successful in commercializing any of such
    products on a timely basis, if at all, including, without
    limitation, nebivolol, for which we are dependent on our partner
    Forest Laboratories, which could adversely affect our product
    introduction plans, business, financial position and results of
    operations and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline.

    Before any prescription drug product, including generic drug
    products, can be marketed, marketing authorization approval is
    required by the relevant regulatory authorities
    and/or
    national regulatory agencies (for example the FDA in the United
    States and the European Medicines Agency (or “EMA”) in
    the European Union (or “EU”). The process of obtaining
    regulatory approval to manufacture and market new and generic
    pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly and
    largely unpredictable. Outside the United States, the approval
    process may be more or less rigorous, and the time required for
    approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the
    United States. Bio equivalency studies conducted in one country
    may not be accepted in other countries, and the approval of a
    pharmaceutical product in one country does not necessarily mean
    that the product will be approved in another country. We, or a
    partner, may be unable to obtain requisite approvals on a timely
    basis for new generic or branded products that we may develop,
    license or otherwise acquire. Moreover, if we obtain regulatory
    approval for a drug it may be limited with respect to the
    indicated uses and delivery methods for which the drug may be
    marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for
    the drug. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw
    materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in efficacy
    and bioequivalence testing, as well as in anticipation of the
    product’s launch. In the event that regulatory approval is
    denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this
    inventory becoming obsolete. The timing and cost of obtaining
    regulatory approvals could adversely affect our product
    introduction plans, business, financial position and results of
    operations and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline. See “Item 1. Business — Product
    Development and Government Regulation.”


 


    The approval process for generic pharmaceutical products often
    results in the relevant regulatory agency granting final
    approval to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the
    time a patent claim for a corresponding branded product or other
    market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face
    immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into
    the market. Additionally, further generic approvals often
    continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the
    initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances
    generally result in significantly lower prices, as well as
    reduced margins, for generic products compared to branded
    products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued
    price and margin erosion over the generic product life cycle.


 


    In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
    Restoration Act of 1984, or the Waxman-Hatch Act, provides for a
    period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for
    each ANDA applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a
    certification of invalidity, non-infringement or
    unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to a
    reference drug product, commonly referred to as a
    Paragraph IV certification. During this exclusivity period,
    which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared
    with other applicable ANDA sponsors with Paragraph IV
    certifications, the FDA cannot grant final approval to other
    ANDA sponsors holding applications for the same generic
    equivalent. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV
    certification is successful and the applicant is awarded
    exclusivity, the applicant generally enjoys higher market share,
    net revenues and gross margin for that product. Even if we
    obtain FDA approval for our generic drug products, if we are not
    the first ANDA applicant to challenge a listed patent for such a
    product, we may lose significant advantages to a competitor that
    filed its ANDA containing such a challenge. The same would be
    true in situations where we are required to share our
    exclusivity period with other ANDA sponsors with
    Paragraph IV certifications. Such situations could have a
    material adverse effect on our ability to market that product
    profitably and on our business, financial position and results
    of operations, and the market value of our common stock could
    decline.


 


    In Europe, there is no exclusivity period for the first generic.
    The EMA or national regulatory agencies may grant marketing
    authorizations to any number of generics. However, if there are
    other relevant patents when the core patent expires, for
    example, new formulations, the owner of the original brand
    pharmaceutical may be able to obtain preliminary injunctions in
    certain European jurisdictions preventing launch of the generic
    product, if the generic company did not commence proceedings in
    a timely manner to invalidate any relevant patents prior to
    launch of its generic.


 


    In addition, in jurisdictions other than the United States, we
    may face similar regulatory hurdles and constraints. If we are
    unable to navigate our products through all of the regulatory
    hurdles we face in a timely manner it could adversely affect our
    product introduction plans, business, financial position and
    results of operations and could cause the market value of our
    common stock to decline.

    IF THE INTERCOMPANY TERMS OF CROSS BORDER ARRANGEMENTS WE
    HAVE AMONG OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE DETERMINED TO BE INAPPROPRIATE,
    OUR TAX LIABILITY MAY INCREASE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying
    application of statutes, regulations and interpretations which
    include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border
    arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various
    aspects of our business, including manufacturing, marketing,
    sales and delivery functions. Although our cross border
    arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally
    accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may
    disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits
    taxed in their country, which may result in increased tax
    liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would
    cause our tax expense to increase. This could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    OUR APPROVED PRODUCTS MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED LEVELS OF
    MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
    OUR PROFITABILITY, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
    TO DECLINE.


 


    Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new
    pharmaceutical products, generic or branded, the success of
    those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of
    market acceptance for our new products could be impacted by
    several factors, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the availability of alternative products from our competitors;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price of our products relative to that of our competitors;




 



     
        • 

    
    the timing of our market entry;




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability to market our products effectively to the retail
    level; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the acceptance of our products by government and private
    formularies.





 


    Some of these factors are not within our control. Additionally,
    continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and
    efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the
    industry, government agencies and others. Such studies, which
    increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can
    call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of
    previously marketed products. In some cases, studies have
    resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of
    product marketing or other risk management programs such as the
    need for a patient registry. These situations, should they
    occur, could have a material adverse effect on our
    profitability, business, financial position and results of
    operations, and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline.


 


    A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRODUCTS MAY REPRESENT A
    SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET REVENUES, GROSS PROFIT OR NET
    EARNINGS FROM TIME TO TIME. IF THE VOLUME OR PRICING OF ANY OF
    THESE PRODUCTS DECLINES, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
    ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO
    DECLINE.


 


    Sales of a limited number of our products often represent a
    significant portion of our net revenues, gross profit and net
    earnings. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling
    products declines in the future, our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be materially adversely
    affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline.


 


    WE FACE VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL
    MANUFACTURERS THAT THREATENS THE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE AND
    PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.

    The generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We
    face competition from many U.S. and foreign manufacturers,
    some of whom are significantly larger than we are. Our
    competitors may be able to develop products and processes
    competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons,
    including that they may have:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    proprietary processes or delivery systems;




 



     
        • 

    
    larger research and development and marketing staffs;




 



     
        • 

    
    larger production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area;




 



     
        • 

    
    more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;




 



     
        • 

    
    more products; or




 



     
        • 

    
    more experience in developing new drugs and greater financial
    resources, particularly with regard to manufacturers of branded
    products.





 


    Any of these factors and others could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position and results of
    operations and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline.


 


    BECAUSE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS HEAVILY REGULATED, WE
    FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR
    EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. SHOULD WE FAIL TO
    COMPLY, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR
    BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE
    MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.


 


    The pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various
    governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with
    requirements of the FDA and similar requirements of similar
    agencies in our other markets with respect to the manufacture,
    labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, promotion
    and development of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply
    with regulations of the FDA and other regulators can result in
    fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures,
    recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of
    production
    and/or
    distribution, suspension of the applicable regulator’s
    review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and
    criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the
    regulators may also have the authority to revoke previously
    granted drug approvals. Although we have internal regulatory
    compliance programs and policies and have had a favorable
    compliance history, there is no guarantee that these programs,
    as currently designed, will meet regulatory agency standards in
    the future. Additionally, despite our efforts at compliance,
    there is no guarantee that we may not be deemed to be deficient
    in some manner in the future. If we were deemed to be deficient
    in any significant way, our business, financial position and
    results of operations could be materially affected and the
    market value of our common stock could decline.


 


    In Europe we must also comply with regulatory requirements with
    respect to the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution,
    marketing, advertising, promotion and development of
    pharmaceutical products. Some of these requirements are
    contained in EU regulations and governed by the EMA. Other
    requirements are set down in national laws and regulations of
    the EU Member States. Failure to comply with the regulations can
    result in a range of fines, penalties, product
    recalls/suspensions or even criminal liability. Similar laws and
    regulations exist in most of the markets in which we operate.


 


    In addition to the new drug approval process, government
    agencies also regulate the facilities and operational procedures
    that we use to manufacture our products. We must register our
    facilities with the FDA and other similar regulators. Products
    manufactured in our facilities must be made in a manner
    consistent with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP.
    Compliance with cGMP regulations requires substantial
    expenditures of time, money and effort in such areas as
    production and quality control to ensure full technical
    compliance. The FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our
    manufacturing facilities for compliance. Regulator approval to
    manufacture a drug is site-specific. Failure to comply with cGMP
    regulations at one of our manufacturing facilities could result
    in an enforcement action brought by the FDA or other regulatory
    bodies which could include withholding the approval of our
    submissions or other product applications of that facility. If
    any regulatory body were to require one of our manufacturing
    facilities to cease or limit production, our business could be
    adversely affected. Delay and cost in obtaining FDA or other
    regulatory approval to manufacture at a different facility also
    could have a material



    
    25



Table of Contents




    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    We are subject, as are generally all manufacturers, to various
    federal, state and local laws regulating working conditions, as
    well as environmental protection laws and regulations, including
    those governing the discharge of materials into the environment.
    We are also required to comply with data protection and data
    privacy rules in many countries. Although we have not incurred
    significant costs associated with complying with environmental
    provisions in the past, if changes to such environmental laws
    and regulations are made in the future that require significant
    changes in our operations or if we engage in the development and
    manufacturing of new products requiring new or different
    environmental controls, we may be required to expend significant
    funds. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    OUR REPORTING AND PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICARE
    AND/OR
    MEDICAID REBATE PROGRAM AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASING AND
    REBATE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLEX AND MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS
    THAT COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF NEW BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW
    REGULATORY GUIDANCE, OR ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY
    DETERMINATION OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE OBLIGATIONS COULD
    SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
    COULD DECLINE.


 


    The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with
    respect to Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid reimbursement and rebates and other governmental
    programs are complex. As discussed elsewhere in this
    Form 10-K,
    we and other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in a number
    of suits filed by state attorneys general and have been notified
    of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice
    with respect to Medicaid reimbursement and rebates. While we
    cannot predict the outcome of the investigation, possible
    remedies which the United States government could seek include
    treble damages, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. In connection with such an
    investigation, the United States government may also seek a
    Corporate Integrity Agreement (administered by the Office of
    Inspector General of HHS) with us which could include ongoing
    compliance and reporting obligations. Because our processes for
    these calculations and the judgments involved in making these
    calculations involve, and will continue to involve, subjective
    decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are
    subject to the risk of errors. In addition, they are subject to
    review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies,
    and it is possible that such reviews could result in material
    changes. Further, effective October 1, 2007, the Centers
    for Medicaid and Medicare Services, or CMS, adopted new rules
    for Average Manufacturer’s Price, or AMP, based on the
    provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA. One
    significant change as a result of the DRA is that AMP will be
    disclosed to the public. AMP was historically kept confidential
    by the government and participants in the Medicaid program.
    Disclosing AMP to competitors, customers, and the public at
    large could negatively affect our leverage in commercial price
    negotiations.


 


    In addition, as also disclosed herein, a number of state and
    federal government agencies are conducting investigations of
    manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to Average
    Wholesale Prices, or AWP, in which they have suggested that
    reporting of inflated AWP has led to excessive payments for
    prescription drugs. We and numerous other pharmaceutical
    companies have been named as defendants in various actions
    relating to pharmaceutical pricing issues and whether allegedly
    improper actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers led to
    excessive payments by Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid.


 


    Any governmental agencies that have commenced, or may commence,
    an investigation of the Company could impose, based on a claim
    of violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil
    and/or
    criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible
    exclusion from federal health care programs including Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid. Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even
    in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore,
    should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly
    calculate and report payments — and even in the
    absence of any such ambiguity — a governmental
    authority may take a position contrary to a position we have
    taken, and may impose civil
    and/or
    criminal sanctions. Any such penalties or sanctions could have a
    material

    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    WE EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT MAY NOT LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT
    INTRODUCTIONS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE PRODUCTS INTO
    THE MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.


 


    Much of our development effort is focused on technically
    difficult-to-formulate products
    and/or
    products that require advanced manufacturing technology. We
    conduct research and development primarily to enable us to
    manufacture and market approved pharmaceuticals in accordance
    with applicable regulations. Typically, research expenses
    related to the development of innovative compounds and the
    filing of marketing authorization applications for innovative
    compounds (such as NDAs in the United States) are significantly
    greater than those expenses associated with the development of
    and filing of marketing authorization applications for, generic
    products (such as ANDAs in the United States and abridged
    applications in Europe). As we continue to develop new products,
    our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the
    inherent risk associated with research and development efforts
    in our industry, particularly with respect to new drugs
    (including, without limitation, nebivolol), our, or a
    partner’s, research and development expenditures may not
    result in the successful introduction of new pharmaceutical
    products approved by the relevant regulatory bodies. Also, after
    we submit a marketing authorization application for a new
    compound or generic product, the relevant regulatory authority
    may request that we conduct additional studies and, as a result,
    we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and
    development costs to develop a particular product. Finally, we
    cannot be certain that any investment made in developing
    products will be recovered, even if we are successful in
    commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant
    resources on research and development efforts and are not able,
    ultimately, to introduce successful new products as a result of
    those efforts, our business, financial position and results of
    operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market
    value of our common stock could decline.


 


    A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM
    SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. ANY SIGNIFICANT
    REDUCTION OF BUSINESS WITH ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
    COULD DECLINE.


 


    A significant portion of our net revenues is derived from sales
    to a limited number of customers. If we were to experience a
    significant reduction in or loss of business with one such
    customer, or if one such customer were to experience difficulty
    in paying us on a timely basis, our business, financial position
    and results of operations could be materially adversely
    affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline.


 


    THE USE OF LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE STRATEGIES BY
    COMPETITORS, BOTH BRAND AND GENERIC, INCLUDING “AUTHORIZED
    GENERICS” AND CITIZEN’S PETITIONS, AS WELL AS THE
    POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION, MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS
    ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OR MARKETING OF OUR GENERIC
    PRODUCTS, COULD DELAY OR PREVENT SUCH INTRODUCTION
    AND/OR COULD
    SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR PROFIT POTENTIAL. THESE FACTORS COULD
    HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Our competitors, both branded and generic, often pursue
    strategies to prevent or delay competition from generic
    alternatives to branded products. These strategies include, but
    are not limited to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will
    begin to market an authorized generic, a generic equivalent of a
    branded product, at the same time generic competition initially
    enters the market;




 



     
        • 

    
    filing citizen’s petitions with the FDA or other regulatory
    bodies, including timing the filings so as to thwart generic
    competition by causing delays of our product approvals;






    
    27



Table of Contents



 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    seeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would
    make it more difficult to demonstrate bioequivalence;




 



     
        • 

    
    initiating legislative efforts to limit the substitution of
    generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals;




 



     
        • 

    
    filing suits for patent infringement that may delay regulatory
    approval of many generic products;




 



     
        • 

    
    introducing “next-generation” products prior to the
    expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product,
    which often materially reduces the demand for the first generic
    product for which we seek regulatory approval;




 



     
        • 

    
    obtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting
    clinical trials of brand drugs in pediatric populations or by
    other potential methods;




 



     
        • 

    
    persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brand
    name drugs for which the patents are about to expire, thus
    allowing the brand name company to obtain new patented products
    serving as substitutes for the products withdrawn; and




 



     
        • 

    
    seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent
    protection is about to expire.





 


    In the United States, some companies have lobbied Congress for
    amendments to the Waxman-Hatch legislation that would give them
    additional advantages over generic competitors. For example,
    although the term of a company’s drug patent can be
    extended to reflect a portion of the time an NDA is under
    regulatory review, some companies have proposed extending the
    patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical
    trials rather than the one-half year that is currently permitted.


 


    If proposals like these in the United States, Europe or in other
    countries where we operate were to become effective, our entry
    into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated
    with new products may be delayed, reduced or eliminated, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause the market
    value of our common stock to decline.


 


    WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO
    APPLY A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO
    SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS MAY HAVE
    A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION
    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF
    OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the
    consideration for our acquisition of Merck Generics. Our high
    level of indebtedness could have important consequences,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and
    industry conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations and proceeds of any equity issuances to payments
    on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash
    flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
    and investments and other general corporate purposes;




 



     
        • 

    
    making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage
    the cash flow for our businesses;




 



     
        • 

    
    limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;




 



     
        • 

    
    making it difficult for us to meet the leverage and interest
    coverage ratios required by our Senior Credit Agreement;




 



     
        • 

    
    limiting our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our
    working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt
    service requirements and other financing needs;




 



     
        • 

    
    increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in
    general because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears
    interest at floating rates;






    
    28



Table of Contents



 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    requiring us to sell assets in order to pay down debt; and




 



     
        • 

    
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that
    have less debt.





 


    If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our
    indebtedness, we may need to refinance all or part of our
    existing indebtedness, borrow more money or sell securities,
    some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable
    terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business.
    Although the terms of our Senior Credit Agreement allow us to
    incur additional debt, this is subject to certain limitations
    which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness
    we otherwise desire. In addition, if we incur additional debt,
    the risks described above could intensify. Furthermore, if
    future debt financing is not available to us when required or is
    not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our
    business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to
    competitive pressures or satisfy our obligations under our
    indebtedness. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position and results of
    operations and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline.


 


    WE MAY DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
    PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH, AND WHICH COULD AFFECT
    OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
    COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We may from time to time consider selling certain assets if we
    determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy, or
    if we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is
    attractive, or in order to reduce indebtedness, or for other
    reasons. We have explored and will continue to explore the sale
    of certain non-core assets; in addition, we have recently
    announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives
    (including a divestiture) for our Dey business, and that Matrix
    is doing the same in regard to Docpharma. Although our intention
    is to engage in asset sales only if they advance our overall
    strategy, any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our
    business, our market share in particular markets or our
    opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or
    therapeutic categories. We also continue to review the carrying
    value of manufacturing and intangible assets for indications of
    impairment as circumstances require. Future events and decisions
    may lead to asset impairments and/or related costs. As a result,
    any such sale or impairment could have an adverse effect on our
    business, prospects and opportunities for growth, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause the market
    value of our common stock to decline.


 


    OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND ANY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS WE
    INCUR IN THE FUTURE IMPOSE, OR MAY IMPOSE, SIGNIFICANT OPERATING
    AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM
    CAPITALIZING ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE
    A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION
    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF
    OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Our credit facilities and any additional indebtedness we incur
    in the future impose, or may impose, significant operating and
    financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our
    ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness,
    make investments, pay dividends, prepay other indebtedness, sell
    assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with our
    affiliates or restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay
    dividends, or merge or consolidate. In addition, our Senior
    Secured Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified
    financial ratios. We cannot assure you that these covenants will
    not adversely affect our ability to finance our future
    operations or capital needs or to pursue available business
    opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants or our
    inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result
    in a default under the related indebtedness. If a default
    occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our
    indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to
    be immediately due and payable. These factors could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations and could cause the market value of our
    common stock to decline.


 


    WE DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE
    RAW MATERIALS, PARTICULARLY THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND(S) COMPRISING
    THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, THAT WE USE TO MANUFACTURE
    OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FINISHED GOODS. A PROLONGED
    INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION 



    
    29



Table of Contents




    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK COULD DECLINE.


 


    We typically purchase the active pharmaceutical ingredient
    (i.e., the chemical compounds that produce the desired
    therapeutic effect in our products) and other materials and
    supplies that we use in our manufacturing operations, as well as
    certain finished products, from many different foreign and
    domestic suppliers.


 


    Additionally, we maintain safety stocks in our raw materials
    inventory and, in certain cases where we have listed only one
    supplier in our applications with regulatory agencies, have
    received regulatory agency approval to use alternative suppliers
    should the need arise. However, there is no guarantee that we
    will always have timely and sufficient access to a critical raw
    material or finished product. A prolonged interruption in the
    supply of a single-sourced raw material, including the active
    ingredient, or finished product could cause our financial
    position and results of operations to be materially adversely
    affected, and the market value of our common stock could
    decline. In addition, our manufacturing capabilities could be
    impacted by quality deficiencies in the products which our
    suppliers provide, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial position and results of operations, and
    the market value of our common stock could decline.


 


    We utilize controlled substances in certain of our current
    products and products in development and therefore must meet the
    requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the
    related regulations administered by the Drug Enforcement
    Administration, or DEA, in the United States as well as similar
    laws in other countries where we operate. These laws relate to
    the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled
    substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the
    availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our
    current products and products in development and, as a result,
    our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be
    sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical
    trials. We must annually apply to the DEA and other regulatory
    agencies for procurement quota in order to obtain these
    substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA or such regulatory
    agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled
    substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product
    launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those
    products that have already been launched, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations and could cause the market value of our
    common stock to decline.


 


    OUR EFFORTS TO TRANSITION OUR MERCK GENERICS SUBSIDIARIES
    AWAY FROM THE MERCK NAME AND AWAY FROM SERVICES BEING PROVIDED
    BY MERCK KGAA MAY IMPOSE INHERENT RISKS OR RESULT IN GREATER
    THAN EXPECTED COSTS OR IMPEDIMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We have a license from Merck KGaA to continue using the
    “Merck” name in company and product names in respect
    of the Merck Generics businesses for a two-year transitional
    period. We are engaged in efforts to transition in an orderly
    manner away from the Merck name and to achieve global brand
    alignment. Re-branding may prove to be costly, especially in
    markets where the Merck Generics name has strong dominance or
    significant equity locally. In addition, brand migration poses
    risks of both business disruption and customer confusion. Our
    customer outreach and similar efforts may not mitigate fully the
    risks of the name changes, which may lead to reductions in
    revenues in some markets. These losses may have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    As part of the Merck Generics acquisition we entered into a
    transitional services agreement whereby Merck KGaA agreed to
    continue to provide certain services including accounting and
    information technology to Merck Generics for certain periods.
    The cost of transitioning such services from Merck KGaA to us
    during those periods as well as the capital expenditures that
    may be required for system upgrades may be greater than we
    expect or result in other impediments to our business. Such
    costs or impediments may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    In addition, in limited circumstances, entities we acquired in
    the acquisition of Merck Generics are party to litigation
    and/or
    subject to investigation in matters under which we are entitled
    to indemnification by Merck KGaA.



    
    30

    However, there are risks inherent in such indemnities and,
    accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will receive the
    full benefits of such indemnification.


 


    OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF
    US, OUR BRANDS AND THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS. OUR
    BUSINESS OR BRANDS COULD BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHICH
    COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Market perceptions of our business are very important to us,
    especially market perceptions of our brands and the safety and
    quality of our products. If we, or our brands, suffer from
    negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar
    products which other companies distribute are proven to be, or
    are claimed to be, harmful to consumers then this could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations and could cause the market value of our
    common stock to decline. Also, because we are dependant on
    market perceptions, negative publicity associated with illness
    or other adverse effects resulting from our products could have
    a material adverse impact on our business, financial position
    and results of operations and could cause the market value of
    our common stock to decline.


 


    WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
    PRODUCING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. PRODUCTION AT
    ANY ONE OF THESE FACILITIES COULD BE INTERRUPTED, WHICH COULD
    HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    A substantial portion of our capacity as well as our current
    production is attributable to a limited number of manufacturing
    facilities. A significant disruption at any one of those
    facilities, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability
    to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations and could cause the
    market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN THE SALES VOLUME AND PRICES OF
    OUR PRODUCTS AS THE RESULT OF THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD
    CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER GROUPS, SUCH AS THE WHOLESALE
    DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL PHARMACY INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE
    EMERGENCE OF LARGE BUYING GROUPS. THE RESULT OF SUCH
    DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
    BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD
    CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    A significant amount of our sales are to a relatively small
    number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains. These
    customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain
    of generic pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail
    drug chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo,
    significant consolidation. This consolidation may result in
    these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and
    consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our
    business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups
    representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence
    and influence of managed care organizations and similar
    institutions potentially enable those groups to attempt to
    extract price discounts on our products. The result of these
    developments may have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations and could cause the
    market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,
    OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THEIR
    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, FORCING US TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL
    RESOURCES IN RESULTING LITIGATION, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS
    UNCERTAIN. ANY UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME OF SUCH LITIGATION COULD HAVE
    A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION
    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF
    OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

    Companies that produce brand pharmaceutical products routinely
    bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek
    regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of
    their branded products. These companies allege patent
    infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights
    as the basis for filing suit against an ANDA or similar
    applicant. Likewise, patent holders may bring patent
    infringement suits against companies that are currently
    marketing and selling their approved generic products.
    Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or
    prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If patents
    are held valid and infringed by our products in a particular
    jurisdiction, we would, unless we could obtain a license from
    the patent holder, need to cease selling in that jurisdiction
    and may need to deliver up or destroy existing stock in that
    jurisdiction.


 


    There may also be situations where the Company uses its business
    judgment and decides to market and sell products,
    notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent
    infringement(s) have not been finally resolved by the courts.
    The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the
    remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement
    include, among other things, damages measured by the profits
    lost by the patent owner and not necessarily by the profits
    earned by the infringer. In the case of a willful infringement,
    the definition of which is subjective, such damages may be
    trebled. Moreover, because of the discount pricing typically
    involved with bioequivalent products, patented branded products
    generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than
    bioequivalent products. An adverse decision in a case such as
    this or in other similar litigation could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    WE MAY EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT
    FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, HMOS OR
    OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYERS. ANY SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR
    COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Various governmental authorities (including the UK National
    Health Service and the German statutory health insurance scheme)
    and private health insurers and other organizations, such as
    health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the United States,
    provide reimbursement to consumers for the cost of certain
    pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part
    on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In the
    United States, third-party payers increasingly challenge the
    pricing of pharmaceutical products. This trend and other trends
    toward the growth of HMOs, managed health care and legislative
    health care reform create significant uncertainties regarding
    the future levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products.
    Further, any reimbursement may be reduced in the future, perhaps
    to the point that market demand for our products declines. Such
    a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations and could cause the
    market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    In Germany, recent legislative changes have been introduced
    which are aimed at reducing costs for the German statutory
    health insurance, or SHI, scheme. The measure is likely to have
    an impact upon marketing practice and reimbursement of drugs and
    may increase pressure on competition and reimbursement margins.
    The Act to Increase Competition in the Statutory Health
    Insurance Scheme provides, inter alia: (i) in addition to
    the existing reference price scheme, SHI funds will impose
    reimbursement caps on innovative drugs; (ii) SHI-funds will
    receive a rebate for generic drugs corresponding to 10% of the
    selling price, excluding VAT (this does not apply to generic
    drugs the price of which is at least 30% below the reference
    price); (iii) SHI funds will receive a rebate for generic
    drugs corresponding to 16% of the selling price, excluding VAT,
    for generics which are not listed in the inventory of groups of
    pharmaceuticals with a fixed price to be reimbursed by the
    statutory health insurance scheme; and (iv) new incentives
    for individual rebate contracts between pharmaceutical companies
    and single SHI funds. These changes could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading produced recommendations
    in February 2007 that suggested that the UK should move towards
    a value based pricing structure for the reimbursement of
    pharmaceutical products from 2010. If these recommendations are
    accepted and lead to change in the system of reimbursement, this
    could lead to increased pressure on competition and
    reimbursement margins. This could have a material adverse effect
    on our



    
    32

    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT MAY INFLUENCE PRICES
    OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
    OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
    COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Current or future federal, state or foreign laws and regulations
    may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could
    adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products.
    For example, programs in existence in certain states in the
    United States seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those
    states through the regulation and administration of the sale of
    prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular
    state Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which
    Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could
    adversely affect the prices we receive for our products and
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause the market
    value of our common stock to decline.


 


    In order to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, most member
    states in the EU regulate the pricing of products and, in some
    cases, limit the range of different forms of pharmaceuticals
    available for prescription by national health services. These
    controls can result in considerable price differences between
    member states.


 


    WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CERTAIN
    GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES OF
    SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR INQUIRIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We are involved in various legal proceedings and certain
    government inquiries, including, but not limited to, patent
    infringement, product liability, breach of contract and claims
    involving Medicare
    and/or
    Medicaid reimbursements, some of which are described in our
    periodic reports and involve claims for, or the possibility of
    fines and penalties involving, substantial amounts of money or
    other relief. If any of these legal proceedings or inquiries
    were to result in an adverse outcome, the impact could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations and could cause the market value of our
    common stock to decline.


 


    With respect to product liability, we maintain commercial
    insurance to protect against and manage a portion of the risks
    involved in conducting our business. Although we carry
    insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can
    fully protect against all such risks because of the potential
    liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceuticals
    for human consumption. To the extent that a loss occurs,
    depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance
    coverage maintained, it could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial position and results of operations and
    could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF
    BUSINESS WHICH PERIODICALLY INCORPORATE PROVISIONS WHEREBY WE
    INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT THAT WE
    WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS, IT
    COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into
    employment, legal settlement, and other agreements which
    incorporate indemnification provisions. We maintain insurance
    coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our
    obligations under certain of these indemnification provisions.
    However, should our obligation under an indemnification
    provision exceed our coverage or should coverage be denied, our
    business, financial position and results of operations could be
    materially affected and the market value of our common stock
    could decline.


 


    OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED
    ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. ANY FAILURE TO
    ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL

    COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE
    MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    It is important that we attract and retain qualified personnel
    in order to develop new products and compete effectively. If we
    fail to attract and retain key scientific, technical or
    management personnel, our business could be affected adversely.
    Additionally, while we have employment agreements with certain
    key employees in place, their employment for the duration of the
    agreement is not guaranteed. If we are unsuccessful in retaining
    our key employees, it could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial position and results of operations and
    could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    WE HAVE BEGUN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE
    PLANNING SYSTEM. AS WITH ANY IMPLEMENTATION OF A SIGNIFICANT NEW
    SYSTEM, DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED COULD RESULT IN BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTIONS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
    BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD
    CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We have begun the implementation of an enterprise resource
    planning, or ERP, system in the United States to enhance
    operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of
    our business operations. Implementations of ERP systems and
    related software carry risks such as cost overruns, project
    delays and business interruptions and delays. If we experience a
    material business interruption as a result of our ERP
    implementation, it could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES WOULD INVOLVE A
    NUMBER OF INHERENT RISKS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    We may continue to seek to expand our product line through
    complementary or strategic acquisitions of other companies,
    products or assets, or through joint ventures, licensing
    agreements or other arrangements or may determine to divest
    certain products or assets. Any such acquisitions, joint
    ventures or other business combinations may involve significant
    challenges in integrating the new company’s operations and
    divestitures could be equally challenging. Either process may
    prove to be complex and time consuming and require substantial
    resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing
    businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with
    customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have
    business or other dealings.


 


    We may be unable to realize synergies or other benefits expected
    to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other
    transactions or investments we may undertake, or be unable to
    generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated
    inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits.
    Realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other
    transactions could take longer than expected, and implementation
    difficulties, unforeseen expenses, complications and delays,
    market factors or a deterioration in domestic and global
    economic conditions could alter the anticipated benefits of any
    such transactions. We may also compete for certain acquisition
    targets with companies having greater financial resources than
    us or other advantages over us that may prevent us from
    acquiring a target. These factors could impair our growth and
    ability to compete, require us to focus additional resources on
    integration of operations rather than other profitable areas,
    otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations and could cause the
    market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    MATRIX, AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, IS LOCATED IN
    INDIA AND IT IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND
    POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES IN INDIA. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR
    COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    In recent years, Matrix has benefited from many policies of the
    Government of India and the Indian state governments in the
    states in which we operate, which are designed to promote
    foreign investment generally, including significant tax
    incentives, liberalized import and export duties and
    preferential rules on foreign



    
    34



Table of Contents




    investment and repatriation. There is no assurance that such
    policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the
    current federal government, could trigger significant changes in
    India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies
    and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally
    and our business in particular.


 


    In addition, our financial performance and the market price of
    our securities may be adversely affected by general economic
    conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including
    changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and
    taxation policies, as well as social stability and political,
    economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the
    future. In particular, India has experienced significant
    economic growth over the last several years, but faces major
    challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These
    challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure
    development and improving access to healthcare and education.
    Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees and
    develop and operate our manufacturing facilities could be
    adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these
    challenges.


 


    Southern Asia has, from time to time, experienced instances of
    civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries,
    including India and Pakistan. Such military activity or
    terrorist attacks in the future could influence the Indian
    economy by disrupting communications and making travel more
    difficult. Resulting political tensions could create a greater
    perception that investments in companies with Indian operations
    involve a high degree of risk, and that there is a risk of
    disruption of services provided by companies with Indian
    operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    share price
    and/or the
    market for Matrix’s products. Furthermore, if India were to
    become engaged in armed hostilities, particularly hostilities
    that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear
    weapons, Matrix might not be able to continue its operations. We
    generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions
    caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts and wars. These
    risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations and could cause the
    market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR
    COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    A significant portion of our revenues, indebtedness and our
    costs will be denominated in foreign currencies including the
    Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the
    Euro, the Indian rupee and the Japanese Yen. We report our
    financial results in U.S. dollars. Our results of
    operations could be adversely affected by certain movements in
    exchange rates. From time to time, we may implement currency
    hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not
    be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments
    will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. These risks
    could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations and could cause the market
    value of our common stock to decline.


 


    IF WE FAIL TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY RIGHTS, THEN WE COULD LOSE REVENUE UNDER OUR LICENSING
    AGREEMENTS OR LOSE SALES TO GENERIC COPIES OF OUR BRANDED
    PRODUCTS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
    OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
    COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Our success, particularly in our specialty business, depends in
    large part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce
    patents, and protect trade secrets, know-how and other
    proprietary information. Our ability to commercialize any
    branded product successfully will largely depend upon our
    ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to
    prevent third parties from developing substantially equivalent
    products. In the absence of patent and trade secret protection,
    competitors may adversely affect our branded products business
    by independently developing and marketing substantially
    equivalent products. It is also possible that we could incur
    substantial costs if we are required to initiate litigation
    against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property
    rights.


 


    We have filed patent applications covering composition of,
    methods of making,
    and/or
    methods of using, our branded products and branded product
    candidates. We may not be issued patents based on patent
    applications already filed or that we file in the future and if
    patents are issued, they may be insufficient in scope to cover
    our



    
    35



Table of Contents




    branded products. The issuance of a patent in one country does
    not ensure the issuance of a patent in any other country.
    Furthermore, the patent position of companies in the
    pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and
    factual questions and has been and remains the subject of much
    litigation. Legal standards relating to scope and validity of
    patent claims are evolving. Any patents we have obtained, or
    obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or
    circumvented. Moreover, the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office may commence interference proceedings involving our
    patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, or
    invalidation or circumvention of, our patents or patent
    applications would be costly, would require significant time and
    attention of our management, could cause a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position and results of
    operations and could cause the market value of our common stock
    to decline.


 


    OUR SPECIALTY BUSINESS DEVELOPS, FORMULATES, MANUFACTURES AND
    MARKETS BRANDED PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. THESE RISKS
    COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET
    VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Our branded products, developed, formulated, manufactured and
    marketed by our specialty business may be subject to the
    following risks:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    limited patent life;




 



     
        • 

    
    competition from generic products;




 



     
        • 

    
    reductions in reimbursement rates by third-party payors;




 



     
        • 

    
    importation by consumers;




 



     
        • 

    
    product liability;




 



     
        • 

    
    drug development risks arising from typically greater research
    and development investments than generics; and




 



     
        • 

    
    unpredictability with regard to establishing a market.





 


    These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.


 


    WE MUST MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND BE ABLE, ON
    AN ANNUAL BASIS, TO PROVIDE AN ASSERTION AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS
    OF SUCH CONTROLS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS
    OR TO IMPLEMENT NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
    ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON
    STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to
    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial
    reports. We are spending a substantial amount of management time
    and resources to comply with changing laws, regulations and
    standards relating to corporate governance and public
    disclosure. In the United States such changes include the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and the New York
    Stock Exchange rules. In particular, Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management’s annual
    review and evaluation of our internal control over financial
    reporting and attestations as to the effectiveness of these
    controls by our independent registered public accounting firm.
    If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we
    may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing
    basis that we have effective internal control over financial
    reporting. Additionally, internal control over financial
    reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its
    inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error,
    the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.
    Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only
    reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
    presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections
    of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk
    that the control may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain
    the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to



    
    36



Table of Contents




    implement required new or improved controls, this could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations, and the market value of our common stock
    could decline.


 


    On October 2, 2007 we acquired Merck Generics. For purposes
    of management’s evaluation of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, we elected to
    exclude Merck Generics from the scope of management’s
    assessment as permitted by guidance provided by the SEC.


 


    THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN ESTIMATES,
    JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ANY FUTURE CHANGES IN
    ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED OR NECESSARY REVISIONS
    TO PRIOR ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS OR CHANGES IN
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD LEAD TO A RESTATEMENT OR REVISION TO
    PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR
    COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    The consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements
    included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC are
    prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
    involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
    reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets),
    liabilities, revenues, expenses (including acquired in-process
    research and development) and income. Estimates, judgments and
    assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and
    any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or
    assumptions could lead to a restatement. Also, any new or
    revised accounting standards may require adjustments to
    previously issued financial statements. Any such changes could
    result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets
    (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities,
    revenues, expenses (including acquired in-process research and
    development) and income. Any such changes could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations and could cause the market value of our common
    stock to decline.


 


    WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT
    AND SIMILAR WORLDWIDE ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS, WHICH IMPOSE
    RESTRICTIONS AND MAY CARRY SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ANY VIOLATIONS
    OF THESE LAWS, OR ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH VIOLATIONS, COULD HAVE A
    MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR
    COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.


 


    The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
    anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit
    companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments
    to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
    Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws,
    which often carry substantial penalties. We operate in
    jurisdictions that have experienced governmental corruption to
    some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance
    with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs
    and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control
    policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or
    other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees
    or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such
    violations, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations and could
    cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
