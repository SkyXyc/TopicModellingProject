We are subject to the economic and industry risks that affect large United States retailers.

•  
  
  
An increase in the level   of competitive pressures in the retail apparel or home-related merchandise   industry.  
 
 
  
  •  
  
  
Potential changes in the   level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or home-related   merchandise.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Potential changes in   geopolitical and/or general economic conditions that could affect the   availability of product and/or the level of consumer spending.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Unseasonable weather   trends that could affect consumer demand for seasonal apparel and   apparel-related products.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
A change in the   availability, quantity or quality of attractive brand-name merchandise at   desirable discounts that could impact our ability to purchase product and   continue to offer customers a wide assortment of competitive bargains.

Potential disruptions in   supply chain that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores   in a timely and cost-effective manner.

We are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies.

The continued success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations, and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis.  Our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue growth or profit growth.  In executing our off-price retail strategies and working to improve our efficiency, expand our store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks, including:


 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability to attract   and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute our   strategies.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability to   effectively implement and operate our various supply chain, core   merchandising and other information systems, including generation of all   necessary data and reports for merchants, allocators and other business users   in a timely and cost-effective manner.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability in 2006 and   2007 to successfully implement new processes and systems enhancements that   are expected to improve our micro-merchandising capabilities with the goal of   being able to plan, buy and allocate product at a more local versus regional   level.  
 
 
  
  •  
  
  
Our ability to improve   new store sales and profitability, especially in newer regions and markets.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability to achieve   and maintain targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in our   distribution centers.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability to continue   to obtain acceptable new store locations.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Our ability to identify   and to successfully enter new geographic markets.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Lower than planned gross   margin, including higher than planned markdowns, inventory shortage or   freight costs.  
 
 
  
  
•  
  
  
Greater than planned   operating costs including, among other factors, increases in occupancy costs,   advertising costs, and wage and benefit costs, including as a result of   changes in labor laws or as a result of class action or other lawsuits   relating to wage and hour claims and other labor-related matters.
