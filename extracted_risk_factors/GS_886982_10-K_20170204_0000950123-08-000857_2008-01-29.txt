    Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II,

    Form 10-K.


 


    In the case of statements about our investment banking
    transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk
    that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that
    they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,
    if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may
    differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
    Important factors that could result in a modification of the
    terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed
    include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in
    general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility
    in the securities markets generally or an adverse development
    with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of
    financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities
    markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
    development with respect to a party to the transaction or a
    failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a
    discussion of other important factors that could adversely
    affect our investment banking transactions, see “Risk
    Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report
    on
    Form 10-K
    and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II,
    Item 7 of the Annual Report on

    Where We Conduct
    Business


 


    As of November 30, 2007, we operated offices in over 25
    countries and 43% of our 30,522 employees were based
    outside the United States. In 2007, we derived 49% of our net
    revenues and 57% of our pre-tax earnings outside of the
    Americas. See geographic information in Note 16 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our clients and customers are located worldwide, and we are an
    active participant in financial markets around the world. We
    have developed and continue to build strong investment banking
    relationships in new and developing markets. We also continue to
    expand our presence throughout these markets to invest
    strategically when opportunities arise and to work more closely
    with our asset management clients in these regions. Our global
    reach is illustrated by the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we are a member of and an active participant in most of the
    world’s major stock, options and futures exchanges and
    marketplaces;




 



     
        • 

    
    we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond
    markets around the world;




 



     
        • 

    
    we have interbank dealer status in currency markets around the
    world; and




 



     
        • 

    
    we are a member of or have relationships with major commodities
    exchanges worldwide.





 


    Our businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research
    division, which, as of November 2007, provided research coverage
    of over 3,250 companies worldwide and over 50 national
    economies, and maintained a presence in locations around the
    world.


 


    We continue to expand our geographic reach. For example, over
    the past two years we have opened offices in Mumbai, Moscow, Sao
    Paulo, Dubai, Qatar and Tel Aviv, become licensed as a
    broker-dealer in Russia, India and China, opened a bank in
    Brazil and entered into the asset management business in South
    Korea. In December 2007, we established two wholly owned banks
    in Dublin, Ireland. Through this banking presence, we will
    initially focus on our private client business, underwrite
    commercial bank loans, undertake fund administration for our
    European global securities services business and facilitate
    funding transactions for the firm.

    Investment
    Banking


 


    Investment Banking represented 16% of 2007 net revenues. We
    provide a broad range of investment banking services to a
    diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,
    investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to
    develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients
    as their lead investment bank.


 


    Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry
    and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment
    bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually
    assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our
    clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to
    teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated
    fashion for the benefit of our clients.


 


    Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire
    resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment
    banking serving as “front of the house.” To accomplish
    this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and
    debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and
    liability management activities. This coordination is intended
    to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset
    and liability exposures and their capital.


 


    Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:
    Financial Advisory and Underwriting.


 



    Financial
    Advisory


 


    Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to
    mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense
    activities, restructurings and spin-offs. Our mergers and
    acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share
    of assignments in large, complex transactions for which we
    provide multiple services, including “one-stop”
    acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as
    well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest
    rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number
    of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that
    we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.


 



    Underwriting


 


    Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of
    a wide range of securities and other financial instruments,
    including common and preferred stock, convertible and
    exchangeable securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt,
    sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank loans,
    asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such
    as mortgage-related securities and the securities of real estate
    investment trusts.


 


    Equity Underwriting.  Equity underwriting has
    been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers
    and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in
    winning mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our
    leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide
    public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex
    transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.


 


    Debt Underwriting.  We engage in the
    underwriting and origination of various types of debt
    instruments, including investment-grade debt securities,
    high-yield debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging
    market debt securities, which may be issued by, among others,
    corporate, sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we
    underwrite and originate structured securities, which include
    mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities
    and collateralized debt obligations.

    Trading and
    Principal Investments


 


    Trading and Principal Investments represented 68% of
    2007 net revenues. Trading and Principal Investments
    facilitates client transactions with a diverse group of
    corporations, financial institutions, investment funds,
    governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions
    through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed
    income and equity products, currencies, commodities and
    derivatives on these products. In addition, we engage in
    market-making and specialist activities on equities and options
    exchanges, and we clear client transactions on major stock,
    options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our
    merchant banking and other investing activities, we make
    principal investments directly and through funds that we raise
    and manage.


 


    To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal
    Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We
    believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate
    client transactions distinguishes us from many of our
    competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.


 


    Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into
    three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities;
    Equities; and Principal Investments.


 



    Fixed Income,
    Currency and Commodities and Equities


 


    Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are
    large and diversified operations through which we engage in a
    variety of customer-driven and proprietary trading and investing
    activities.


 


    In our customer-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to
    deliver high-quality service by offering broad market-making and
    market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In addition,
    we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by committing
    capital and taking risk, to facilitate client transactions and
    to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make markets, commit
    capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed income,
    currency, commodity and equity products and their derivatives is
    crucial to our client relationships and to support our
    underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity.


 


    We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven
    businesses in three ways:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high
    volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.




 



     
        • 

    
    Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital
    position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where
    spreads and fees are generally larger.




 



     
        • 

    
    Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address
    complex client needs.





 


    Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination
    to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and
    expertise.


 


    In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we
    assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify,
    analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our
    analytical models to analyze information and make informed
    trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived
    disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and
    from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.

Table of Contents





    FICC


 


    We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products,
    mortgage-related securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed instruments, currencies and commodities, structure
    and enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and
    engage in proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five
    principal businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies;
    interest rate products, including money market instruments; and
    mortgage-related securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed instruments.


 


    Commodities.  We enter into trades with our
    clients in, make markets in, and trade for our own account a
    wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests
    in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products,
    metals, natural gas and electricity, and forest products.


 


    As part of our commodities business, we acquire and dispose of
    interests in, and engage in the development and operation of,
    electric power generation facilities and related activities. In
    November 2007, we disposed of approximately 80% of our
    ownership interests in 14 power plants, and we have entered
    into contractual arrangements to manage these plants. In
    addition to our remaining minority interest in these facilities,
    we have a portfolio of four other power generation facilities.


 


    Credit Products.  We offer to and trade for our
    clients a broad array of credit and credit-linked products all
    over the world, including credit derivatives, investment-grade
    corporate securities, high-yield securities, bank and secured
    loans (origination and trading), municipal securities, and
    emerging market and distressed debt. For example, we enter, as
    principal, into complex structured transactions designed to meet
    client needs.


 


    In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan
    facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are
    extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended
    to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace
    them with other funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit
    origination activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on
    commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of
    commitments to other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing
    the positions through investment vehicles sold to other
    investors. Underwriting fees from syndications of these
    commitments are recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment
    Banking segment. However, to the extent that we recognize losses
    on these commitments, such losses are recorded within our
    Trading and Principal Investments segment, net of any related
    underwriting fees. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Contractual Obligations and
    Commitments” in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K
    for additional information on our commitments.


 


    Our credit products business includes making significant
    long-term and short-term investments for our own account
    (sometimes investing together with our merchant banking funds)
    in a broad array of asset classes (including distressed debt)
    globally. We opportunistically invest in debt and equity
    securities and secured loans, and in private equity, real estate
    and other assets.


 


    Currencies.  We act as a dealer in foreign
    exchange and trade for our clients and ourselves in most
    currencies on exchanges and in cash and derivative markets
    globally.


 


    Interest Rate Products.  We trade and make
    markets in a variety of interest rate products, including
    interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and
    government bonds, as well as money market instruments, such as
    commercial paper, treasury bills, repurchase agreements and
    other highly liquid securities and instruments. This business
    includes our matched book, which consists of short-term
    collateralized financing transactions.



    
    8



Table of Contents



 


    Mortgage Business.  We make markets in and
    trade for our clients and ourselves commercial and residential
    mortgage-related securities and loan products (including prime,
    subprime and other nontraditional mortgages) and other
    asset-backed and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in
    these products for proprietary trading purposes as well as for
    securitization or syndication. We also originate and service
    commercial and residential mortgages.


 



    Equities


 


    We make markets in and trade equities and equity-related
    products, structure and enter into equity derivative
    transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate
    commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on
    major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our
    Equities customer franchise and clearing activities.


 


    Equities includes two principal businesses: our customer
    franchise business and principal strategies. We also engage in
    specialist and insurance activities.


 


    Customer Franchise Business.  Our customer
    franchise business includes primarily customer-driven activities
    in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities
    markets. These activities also include clearing client
    transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges
    worldwide, as well as our options specialist and market-making
    businesses. Our customer franchise business increasingly
    involves providing our clients with access to electronic
    “low-touch” equity trading platforms, and electronic
    trades now account for the majority of our customer trading
    activity in this business. However, a majority of our net
    revenues in this business continues to be derived from our
    traditional “high-touch” handling of more complex
    trades. We expect both types of trading activities to remain
    important components of our customer franchise business.


 


    We trade equity securities and equity-related products,
    including convertible securities, options, futures and
    over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis
    as an agent, as a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a
    principal, we facilitate client transactions, often by
    committing capital and taking risk, to provide liquidity to
    clients with large blocks of stocks or options. For example, we
    are active in the execution of large block trades. We also
    execute transactions as agent and offer clients direct
    electronic access to trading markets.


 


    In the options and futures markets, we structure, distribute and
    execute derivatives on market indices, industry groups,
    financial measures and individual company stocks to facilitate
    client transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop
    strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging
    and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also
    create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated
    investors to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or
    liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading
    participants in the trading and development of equity derivative
    instruments. In options, we are a specialist and/or market maker
    on the International Securities Exchange, the Chicago Board
    Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the Boston Options Exchange, the
    Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.


 


    Principal Strategies.  Our principal strategies
    business is a multi-strategy proprietary investment business
    that invests and trades for our own account. Principal
    strategies trades and invests our capital across global markets
    employing strategies that are primarily focused on public
    markets. Most strategies involve fundamental equities and
    relative value trading (which involves trading strategies
    designed to take advantage of perceived discrepancies in the
    relative value of financial instruments, including equity,
    equity-related and debt instruments). Other strategies involve
    event-driven investments (which focus on event-oriented special
    situations such as corporate restructurings, bankruptcies,
    recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, and legal and
    regulatory events) as well as convertible bond trading, various
    types of volatility trading and principal finance (which
    includes private structured investments in public or private
    companies).


 


    At the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008, we reassigned
    approximately one-half of the traders and other personnel and
    transferred approximately one-half of the firm’s assets
    comprising our principal strategies business in an effort to
    strengthen and diversify our asset management offerings. These
    assets are now invested in a new alternative investment fund
    managed by our asset

    management business. Over time, we intend to replace the
    reassigned personnel and transferred assets of our principal
    strategies business.


 


    Specialist Activities.  Our specialist
    activities business consists of our stock and exchange-traded
    funds (ETF) specialist and market-making businesses. We engage
    in specialist and market-making activities on equities
    exchanges. In the United States, we are one of the leading stock
    specialists on the NYSE. For ETFs, we are a specialist on the
    NYSE, the American Stock Exchange and NYSE Arca.


 


    Insurance Activities.  Through our insurance
    subsidiaries, we buy, sell and originate variable annuity and
    life insurance contracts, and we participate opportunistically
    in reinsurance activities, including life and annuity
    reinsurance and property catastrophe reinsurance.


 



    Principal
    Investments


 


    Principal Investments primarily represents net revenues from
    four primary sources: returns on corporate and real estate
    investments, overrides on corporate and real estate investments,
    our investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and
    Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and our investment in
    the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
    Group, Inc. (SMFG).


 


    Returns on Corporate and Real Estate
    Investments.  As of November 2007, the aggregate
    carrying value of our principal investments held directly or
    through our merchant banking funds, excluding our investment in
    the ordinary shares of ICBC and the convertible preferred stock
    of SMFG, was $11.93 billion, comprised of corporate
    principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of
    $9.50 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate
    carrying value of $2.43 billion. In addition, as of
    November 2007, we had outstanding unfunded equity capital
    commitments of up to $15.25 billion.


 


    Overrides.  Consists of the increased share of
    the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds
    when the return on a fund’s investments over the life of
    the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred
    to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues
    when all material contingencies have been resolved.


 


    ICBC.  Our investment in the ordinary shares of
    ICBC was acquired on April 28, 2006. The ordinary shares
    acquired from ICBC are subject to transfer restrictions that,
    among other things, prohibit any sale, disposition or other
    transfer until April 28, 2009. From April 28, 2009 to
    October 20, 2009, we may transfer up to 50% of the
    aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that we owned as of
    October 20, 2006. We may transfer the remaining shares
    after October 20, 2009. As of November 2007, the carrying
    value of our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC was
    $6.81 billion. A portion of our interest is held by
    investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.


 


    SMFG.  Our investment in the convertible
    preferred stock of SMFG is generally nontransferable without the
    consent of SMFG but is freely convertible into SMFG common
    stock. As of November 2007, we had hedged approximately 90% of
    the common stock underlying our investment in SMFG and there
    were no restrictions on our ability to hedge the remainder. As
    of November 2007, the carrying value of our investment in the
    SMFG preferred stock was $4.06 billion.


 


    For further information regarding our investments in the
    ordinary shares of ICBC and the convertible preferred stock of
    SMFG, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value —
    Cash Instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of the

    Asset Management
    and Securities Services


 


    Asset Management and Securities Services represented 16% of
    2007 net revenues. Our asset management business provides
    investment advisory and financial planning services and offers
    investment products (primarily through separately managed
    accounts and commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes
    to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and
    primarily generates revenues in the form of management and
    incentive fees. Securities Services provides prime brokerage
    services, financing services and securities lending services to
    institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds,
    pension funds and foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the
    form of interest rate spreads or fees.


 


    Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided
    into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.


 



    Asset
    Management


 


    We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and
    planning. We provide asset management services and offer
    investment products (primarily through separately managed
    accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and
    private investment funds) across all major asset classes: money
    markets, fixed income, equities and alternative investments
    (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies,
    commodities and asset allocation strategies). Through our
    subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco), we also provide
    fee-based financial counseling and financial education in the
    United States.


 


    Assets under management (AUM) typically generate fees as a
    percentage of asset value, which is affected by investment
    performance and by inflows or redemptions. The fees that we
    charge vary by asset class, as do our related expenses. In
    certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive
    fees based on a percentage of a fund’s return or when the
    return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark
    returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are
    recognized when the performance period ends and they are no
    longer subject to adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee
    arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that
    end on December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have
    been seasonally weighted to our first quarter.


 


    AUM includes our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and
    separately managed accounts for institutional and individual
    investors. Alternative investments include our merchant banking
    funds, which generate revenues as described below under
    “Management of Merchant Banking Funds.” AUM includes
    assets in clients’ brokerage accounts to the extent that
    they generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather
    than commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.


 


    AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate
    commissions,
    mark-ups and
    spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments
    in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are
    included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM
    also does not include non-fee-paying assets, including
    interest-bearing deposits held through Goldman Sachs Bank USA
    (GS Bank USA).


 


    See “Trading and Principal Investments —
    Equities — Principal Strategies” above for a
    discussion of the personnel and assets that we moved from our
    principal strategies business to our asset management business
    at the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008.

    Management of Merchant Banking Funds.  Goldman
    Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private
    investment funds. Our strategy with respect to these funds
    generally is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of
    investments that is diversified by industry, product type,
    geographic region, and transaction structure and type. Our
    corporate investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term
    investments in equity and debt securities in privately
    negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and
    investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real
    estate investment funds invest in real estate operating
    companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and
    other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant
    banking funds include a fund that invests in infrastructure and
    infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.


 


    Since inception, we have raised $118 billion of committed
    equity capital in these funds, consisting of $96 billion
    related to our corporate funds and $22 billion related to
    our real estate funds. As of November 2007, $68 billion of
    the committed equity capital was funded and the amount of AUM
    remaining in these funds after distributions was
    $64 billion.


 


    Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue
    streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a
    percentage of a fund’s committed capital, invested capital,
    total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual
    management fees are included in our Asset Management net
    revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in
    some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the
    funds’ unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from
    changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon
    realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return
    for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the
    fund’s income and gains that is a percentage of the income
    and gains from the fund’s investments. The second and third
    of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments
    within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.

    Securities
    Services


 


    Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing
    services and securities lending services to institutional
    clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and
    foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide.


 


    Prime brokerage services.  We offer prime
    brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility
    to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for
    financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime
    brokerage business provides clearing and custody in
    49 markets and provides consolidated multi-currency
    accounting and reporting, fund administration and other
    ancillary services.


 


    Financing services.  A central element of our
    prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our
    clients for their securities trading activities through margin
    and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash
    or other acceptable collateral.


 


    Securities lending services.  Securities
    lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending
    of securities to cover clients’ and Goldman Sachs’
    short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In
    addition, we are an active participant in the broker-to-broker
    securities lending business and the third-party agency lending
    business. Net revenues in securities lending services are, as a
    general matter, weighted toward our second and third quarters
    each year due to seasonally higher activity levels in Europe.


 



    Global Investment
    Research


 


    Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on
    companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and
    macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.


 


    Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of
    November 2007 provided research coverage of over
    3,250 companies worldwide and over 50 national economies.
    This is accomplished by the following departments:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    The Equity Research Departments provide fundamental analysis,
    earnings forecasts and investment opinions for equity securities;




 



     
        • 

    
    The Credit Research Department provides fundamental analysis,
    forecasts and investment opinions as to investment-grade and
    high-yield corporate bonds and credit derivatives;




 



     
        • 

    
    The Economic Research Department formulates macroeconomic
    forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange and interest
    rates;




 



     
        • 

    
    The Commodities Research Department provides research on the
    commodity markets; and




 



     
        • 

    
    The Strategy Research Department provides equity market
    forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector
    allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies
    and options research.





 


    Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is
    provided below under “— Regulation —
    Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States”
    and “Legal Proceedings — Research Independence
    Matters” in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report
    on

    Technology


 


    Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development,
    maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization.
    Our technology initiatives can be broadly categorized into four
    efforts:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Enhancing client service through increased connectivity and the
    provision of value-added, tailored products and services;




 



     
        • 

    
    Improving our trading, execution and clearing capabilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    Risk management; and




 



     
        • 

    
    Overall efficiency, productivity and control.





 


    We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them
    with electronic access to our products and services. In
    particular, we provide global electronic trading and information
    distribution capabilities covering many of our fixed income,
    currency, commodity, equity and mutual fund products around the
    world.


 


    Electronic commerce and technology have changed and will
    continue to change the ways that securities and other financial
    products are traded, distributed and settled. This creates both
    opportunities and challenges for our businesses. We remain
    committed to being at the forefront of technological innovation
    in the global capital markets.


 



    Business
    Continuity and Information Security


 


    Business continuity and information security are high priorities
    for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been
    developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity
    in the event of disruptions at the firm’s critical
    facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The SEC also
    reviews our Business Continuity Program. The key elements of the
    program are crisis management, people recovery facilities,
    business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process
    improvement. In the area of information security, we have
    developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies
    and technology to protect the information assets of the firm and
    our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the
    confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
    resources.


 



    Employees


 


    Management believes that a major strength and principal reason
    for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication
    of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We
    strive to maintain a work environment that fosters
    professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our
    employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.


 


    Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a
    continuous process, in which training plays an important part.
    All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in
    education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various
    locations throughout the world. Another important part of
    instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review
    process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and
    employees they supervise in a
    360-degree
    review process that is integral to our team approach.


 


    As of November 2007, we had 30,522 employees, excluding
    4,572 employees of certain consolidated entities that are
    held for investment purposes only. Consolidated entities held
    for investment purposes include entities that are held strictly
    for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are
    engaged in activities that are not closely related to our
    principal businesses.

    Competition


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and
    dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance
    companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,
    private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of
    our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product
    or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,
    including transaction execution, our products and services,
    innovation, reputation and price.


 


    We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining
    qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete
    effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to
    attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing
    employees.


 


    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry,
    due in part to U.S. federal legislation that has expanded
    the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a
    U.S. bank. In particular, a number of large commercial
    banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial
    services firms have established or acquired broker-dealers or
    have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these
    firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from
    loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, asset
    management and investment banking services, which may enhance
    their competitive position. They also have the ability to
    support investment banking and securities products with
    commercial banking, insurance and other financial services
    revenues in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted
    in pricing pressure in our investment banking and trading
    businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our
    businesses.


 


    Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,
    pressure to retain market share by committing capital to
    businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may
    not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate
    clients increasingly seek such commitments (such as agreements
    to participate in their commercial paper backstop or other loan
    facilities) from financial services firms in connection with
    investment banking and other assignments. We provide these
    commitments through our William Street entities or through GS
    Bank USA, primarily for investment-grade clients, or through
    Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. or our other subsidiaries,
    primarily for other clients. With respect to most of the William
    Street commitments, SMFG provides us with credit loss protection
    that is generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on
    approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of
    $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of
    certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide
    protection for 70% of the second loss on such commitments, up to
    a maximum of $1.13 billion. We also use other financial
    instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain William
    Street commitments not covered by SMFG. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual
    Obligations and Commitments” in Part II, Item 7
    of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for more information regarding the William Street entities and
    for a description of the credit loss protection provided by
    SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with
    investment banking and other assignments do not meet the
    criteria established for the William Street entities and do not
    benefit from the SMFG loss protection. These commitments are
    issued through Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., GS Bank USA
    or our other subsidiaries.


 


    The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly
    increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our
    competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of
    the securities and other financial services markets. As a
    result, we have had to commit capital to support our
    international operations and to execute large global
    transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant
    challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete
    successfully with financial institutions that are larger and
    better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence
    and longer operating history outside the United States.

    We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
    businesses in recent years. There has been considerable pressure
    in the pricing of block trades. Also, equity and debt
    underwriting discounts, as well as trading spreads, have been
    under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute
    trades electronically, through the Internet and through other
    alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on
    trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward
    electronic and other “low-touch,” low-commission
    trading will continue. We believe that we will continue to
    experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the
    future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by
    reducing prices.


 



    Regulation


 


    Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity
    futures and options industries, is subject to extensive
    regulation in the United States and the other countries in which
    we operate. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies
    around the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of
    the securities and other financial markets and with protecting
    the interests of clients participating in those markets. They
    are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of
    Goldman Sachs’ shareholders or creditors.


 


    Broker-dealers, in particular, are subject to regulations that
    cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales
    methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients’
    funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the
    financing of clients’ purchases, and the conduct of
    directors, officers and employees. A number of our affiliates
    are regulated by investment advisory laws in the countries in
    which we operate. See “Risk Factors — Our
    businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and
    pervasive regulation around the world” in Part I,
    Item 1A of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have
    on our businesses.


 

 



    Regulation in the
    United States


 


    In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible
    for the administration of the federal securities laws. The
    Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is subject to regulation by the SEC as
    a Consolidated Supervised Entity. As such, it is subject to
    group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum
    capital standards on a consolidated basis. As part of a
    Consolidated Supervised Entity, Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    (GS&Co.), our principal U.S. broker-dealer, is
    permitted to calculate its regulatory capital requirements in
    accordance with the market and credit risk standards of
    Appendix E of
    Rule 15c3-1
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We may be required or
    may determine to disclose publicly our group-wide Consolidated
    Supervised Entity capital ratios on an ongoing basis beginning
    in mid-2008.


 


    GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and as an
    investment adviser with the SEC and as a
    broker-dealer
    in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
    Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt
    rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as
    GS&Co. FINRA was formed when the NASD and the NYSE merged
    their regulatory operations, although the NYSE continues to have
    oversight over NYSE-related market activities. In addition,
    state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or
    oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses
    are also subject to regulation by various
    non-U.S. governmental
    and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in
    virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs
    Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and two of its
    subsidiaries are registered U.S. broker-dealers and are
    regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs
    Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC
    derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives
    businesses.


 


    The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the
    United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity
    Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the
    federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity
    Exchange Act. Several of Goldman Sachs’ subsidiaries,
    including GS&Co. and GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and
    act as futures

    commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity
    trading advisors and are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.
    The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory
    organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the
    Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the
    National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures
    and commodity options businesses of these entities.


 


    GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to
    Rule 15c3-1
    of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform
    minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require
    that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept
    in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to
    compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with
    the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted
    by
    Rule 15c3-1.
    As of November 2007, GS&Co. and GSEC had net capital in
    excess of their minimum capital requirements. In addition to its
    alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is
    also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of
    $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million
    in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of
    Appendix E of
    Rule 15c3-1.
    GS&Co. is required to notify the SEC in the event that its
    tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of
    November 2007, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net
    capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification
    requirements. These net capital requirements may have the effect
    of prohibiting these entities from distributing or withdrawing
    capital and may require prior notice to the SEC for certain
    withdrawals of capital. See Note 15 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Goldman Sachs’ three limited purpose trust companies
    operate under state or federal law. They are not permitted to
    and do not accept deposits (other than as incidental to their
    trust activities) or make loans and, as a result, are not
    considered to be banks for purposes of the Bank Holding Company
    Act, nor are they insured by the FDIC or subject to the
    Community Reinvestment Act. The Goldman Sachs
    Trust Company, N.A., a national bank that is limited to
    fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the Federal
    Reserve System. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, a New York
    limited purpose trust company, is regulated by the New York
    State Banking Department. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company
    of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose trust company, is
    regulated by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner.


 


    Goldman Sachs has established GS Bank USA, a wholly owned
    industrial bank, to extend credit and to take deposits, other
    than demand deposits. GS Bank USA is regulated by the FDIC and
    the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and is
    subject to minimum capital requirements. As of November 2007, GS
    Bank USA was in compliance with all regulatory capital
    requirements. Because it does not accept demand deposits, GS
    Bank USA is not considered to be a bank for purposes of the Bank
    Holding Company Act. The deposits maintained at GS Bank USA are
    insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law.


 


    Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by
    a number of securities exchanges. The rules of these exchanges
    generally require our specialists to maintain orderly markets in
    the securities in which they are specialists.


 


    J. Aron & Company is authorized by the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission to sell wholesale physical power at
    market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer,
    J. Aron & Company is subject to regulation
    under the Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the
    oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities,
    GS&Co. is also an “exempt holding company” under
    FERC rules.


 


    In addition, as a result of our power-related activities, we are
    subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and
    other governmental laws and regulations, as discussed under
    “Risk Factors — Our power generation interests
    and related activities subject us to extensive regulation, as
    well as environmental and other risks associated with power

    Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
    insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they
    are domiciled and in the other states in which they are
    licensed, and we are subject to oversight as an insurance
    holding company in states where our insurance subsidiaries are
    domiciled. In addition, a number of our other businesses,
    including our lending and mortgage businesses, require us to
    obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject
    to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we
    conduct these businesses.


 


    The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and
    financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of
    various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other
    financial services companies, including standards for verifying
    client identification at account opening, and obligations to
    monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities.
    Through these and other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
    seeks to promote the identification of parties that may be
    involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious
    activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States
    contain some similar provisions. The obligation of financial
    institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their
    clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to
    respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities
    and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with
    other financial institutions, has required the implementation
    and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls
    that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs,
    and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could
    subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.


 

 



    Regulation Outside
    the United States


 


    Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the
    United Kingdom under the regulation of the Financial Services
    Authority (FSA). Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our
    regulated U.K.
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements of the FSA. As of
    November 2007, GSI was in compliance with the FSA capital
    requirements. Other subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs
    International Bank, are also regulated by the FSA.


 


    Goldman Sachs has established two wholly owned banks in Dublin,
    Ireland. These banks are regulated by the Irish Financial
    Services Regulatory Authority. Because our Irish banks have no
    branches, agencies or banking subsidiaries in the United States,
    they do not subject Goldman Sachs to the U.S. Bank Holding
    Company Act. As of the commencement of business in December
    2007, these banks were in compliance with all regulatory capital
    requirements.


 


    Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the
    banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the
    European countries in which they operate, including, among
    others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and
    the Bundesbank in Germany, Banque de France and the
    Autorité des Marchés Financiers in France, Banca
    d’Italia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società
    e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial Markets
    Service in Russia and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.
    Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the
    European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of
    which they are members.


 


    The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA
    and other regulators within the European Union are regulated in
    accordance with national laws, many of which implement European
    Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with
    certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection
    requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. These
    standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented,
    under the same directives, throughout the European Union.


 


    On November 1, 2007, the national implementing legislation
    to the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments
    Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC, known as MiFID) became
    effective in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and
    France. MiFID affects several of our subsidiaries by imposing
    detailed pan-European requirements in areas such as internal
    organization (including conflict management, outsourcing and
    recordkeeping), best execution, real-time disclosure of
    completed transactions in shares, quoting obligations for
    internalized client orders in shares, transaction reporting

    to regulators, client classification and documentation,
    disclosure of fees and other payments received from or paid to
    third parties in relation to investment services and the
    regulation of investment services related to commodity
    derivatives. The lack of detailed regulatory practice under this
    regime could lead to regulatory uncertainties.


 


    Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese
    broker-dealer, is subject to the capital requirements of
    Japan’s Financial Services Agency. As of November 2007,
    GSJCL was in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements.
    GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka
    Securities Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan
    Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and
    the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.


 


    Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong
    Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities
    Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service
    and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, among others,
    regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital
    standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the
    SEC.


 


    Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and
    regulatory authorities of other
    non-U.S. countries
    in which Goldman Sachs operates, including, among others, Brazil
    and Dubai. In addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries
    are regulated by the Bermuda Registrar of Companies.


 

 



    Regulations
    Applicable in and Outside the United States


 


    The U.S. and
    non-U.S. government
    agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,
    as well as state securities commissions and other state
    regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct
    administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the
    issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or
    expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or
    employees. From time to time, our subsidiaries have been subject
    to investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been
    imposed for infractions of various regulations relating to our
    activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on
    us or our businesses.


 


    The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has issued the
    Basel II capital standards, which are designed to promote
    enhanced risk management practices among large, international
    financial services firms by aligning regulatory capital
    requirements more closely with the underlying risks faced by
    these firms. GSI, as well as our other subsidiaries in the
    United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, became subject to the
    Basel II requirements on January 1, 2008. The
    Consolidated Supervised Entity rules described above under
    “— Regulation in the United States,” which
    provide for group-wide supervision, are consistent with Basel
    II. Complying with these new standards has required us to
    develop and apply new and sophisticated measurement techniques
    to determine our regulatory capital adequacy. As an increasing
    number of financial institutions become subject to Basel II, new
    interpretations may arise, and harmonization among regulators
    could then impact the regulatory capital standards under which
    we operate as a Consolidated Supervised Entity, as well as the
    requirements for some of our regulated subsidiaries.


 


    The research areas of investment banks have been and remain the
    subject of regulatory scrutiny. The SEC, the NYSE and FINRA have
    adopted rules governing research analysts, including rules
    imposing restrictions on the interaction between equity research
    analysts and investment banking personnel at member securities
    firms. Various
    non-U.S. jurisdictions
    have imposed both substantive and
    disclosure-based
    requirements with respect to research and may impose additional
    regulations. In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement
    with certain federal and state securities regulators and
    self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into
    equity research analysts’ alleged conflicts of interest.
    The global settlement includes certain restrictions and
    undertakings that have imposed additional costs and limitations
    on the conduct of our businesses, including restrictions on the
    interaction between research and investment banking areas.



    
    20



Table of Contents




    In connection with the research settlement, we have also
    subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on
    the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to
    executives and directors of public companies. The FSA in the
    United Kingdom has imposed requirements on the conduct of the
    allocation process in equity and fixed income securities
    offerings (including initial public offerings and secondary
    distributions). The SEC, the FSA, the NYSE, FINRA and other
    U.S. or
    non-U.S. regulators
    may in the future adopt additional and more stringent rules with
    respect to offering procedures and the management of conflicts
    of interest, and we cannot fully predict the effect that any new
    requirements will have on our business.


 


    Our investment management businesses are subject to significant
    regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating
    to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and
    our management of client funds.


 


    As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold
    capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency
    requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning
    the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based
    upon its underlying risk.


 


    Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with
    regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,
    the European Union or other jurisdictions
    and/or
    enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges
    relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees
    or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations
    could expose us to liability
    and/or
    reputational damage.


 



    Item 1A.  Risk
    Factors


 


    We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in
    our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,
    operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some
    of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.


 



    Our businesses
    may be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial
    markets and economic conditions generally.


 


    Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable
    earnings. While we have achieved record earnings per common
    share in each of our last four fiscal years, reflecting a
    favorable trading and investing environment and an increase in
    investment banking activity, an adverse change in these market
    conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.


 


    Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the
    global financial markets and economic conditions generally, and
    these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically. A
    favorable business environment is generally characterized by,
    among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth,
    stable geopolitical conditions, transparent, liquid and
    efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and
    investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable
    or uncertain economic and market conditions, which can be caused
    by: outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability;
    declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or
    business confidence; limitations on the availability or
    increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in
    inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, default
    rates or the price of basic commodities; corporate, political or
    other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital
    markets; natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of
    these or other factors, have adversely affected, and may in the
    future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many
    ways, including the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Increasing or high interest rates
    and/or
    widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid,
    may create a less favorable environment for certain of our
    businesses, and may affect the fair value of financial
    instruments that we issue or hold. For example, beginning in the
    second half of 2007, difficulties in the mortgage and broader
    credit markets in the United States and elsewhere resulted in a
    relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the






    
    21



Table of Contents






    
    
    



     
    

    
    availability of credit and a corresponding increase in funding
    costs. Credit spreads widened significantly, affecting
    volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets,
    particularly in the markets for mortgage-related securities and
    non-investment-grade debt securities and loans. This negatively
    impacted prices of these securities and loans (as well as
    commitments for these loans), and, to the extent that we sought
    to do so, our ability to sell these securities and loans (and
    loan commitments). The sudden decline in liquidity and prices of
    these types of securities and loans made it generally more
    difficult to value them. These conditions have persisted through
    the end of 2007 and we cannot predict how long these conditions
    will exist or how our businesses may be affected.





 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of
    our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist
    and investing positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may
    adversely affect the value of those positions, including, but
    not limited to, our interest rate and credit products, currency,
    commodity and equity positions, and our merchant banking
    investments, or may reduce our willingness to enter into new
    transactions. From time to time, we have incurred significant
    trading losses in periods of market turbulence. Conversely,
    certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to
    provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in
    volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect
    the results of these businesses.




 



     
        • 

    
    Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as
    limitations on the availability of credit, such as occurred in
    the second half of 2007, can affect our ability to borrow on a
    secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our
    liquidity and results of operations. We seek to finance our less
    liquid assets on a secured basis and disruptions in the credit
    markets are likely to make it harder and more expensive to fund
    these assets. In difficult credit markets, we may be forced to
    fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to
    raise as much funding as we need to support our business
    activities. This could cause us to curtail our business
    activities and could increase our cost of funding, both of which
    could reduce our profitability.




 



     
        • 

    
    Our investment banking business is affected by changes in market
    conditions. Industry-wide declines in the size and number of
    underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse
    effect on our revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce
    expenses correspondingly, our profit margins. In particular,
    because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues
    are derived from our participation in large transactions, a
    decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or
    unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our
    investment banking business. Our clients engaging in mergers and
    acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured
    credit markets to finance their transactions. The lack of
    available credit or increased cost of credit may adversely
    affect the size, volume and timing of our clients’ merger
    and acquisition transactions — particularly large
    transactions — and adversely affect our financial
    advisory and underwriting businesses.




 



     
        • 

    
    We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our
    clients’ portfolios and, in some cases, we also receive
    incentive fees based on increases in the value of our
    clients’ portfolios. Reductions in the level of the equity
    markets or increases in interest rates tend to reduce the value
    of our clients’ portfolios, which in turn may reduce the
    fees we earn for managing assets. Increases in interest rates or
    attractive conditions in other investments could cause our
    clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other
    products. Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable
    economic or market conditions, investment performance by our
    asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or
    competitors could result in a decline in assets under
    management, including through redemptions, and in the incentive
    and management fees we receive and might make it more difficult
    to attract new investors.

        • 

    
    Market volatility has been relatively low in recent years,
    although it generally increased in the second half of 2007. An
    increase in volatility increases our measured risk, which might
    cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to reduce
    certain of our business activities. In such circumstances, we
    may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a
    timely, cost-effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset
    the increase in measured risk.




 



     
        • 

    
    The volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and
    as a specialist or market maker may decline, which would reduce
    the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In our
    specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules
    to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in
    a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an
    increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets
    and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on
    multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses
    and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible
    assets.




 



     
        • 

    
    The emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health
    emergency, or concerns over the possibility of such an
    emergency, could create economic and financial disruptions in
    emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could
    lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations)
    that could impair our ability to manage our businesses around
    the world. In addition, unforeseen or catastrophic events,
    including health emergencies, terrorist attacks or natural
    disasters, could expose our insurance subsidiaries to
    significant losses.





 



    We may incur
    losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and
    strategies.


 


    We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk
    and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but
    complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and
    legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review
    processes and other mechanisms. Our trading risk management
    process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading
    positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ
    a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk
    mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that
    accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and
    financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.
    Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.


 


    The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures
    reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack
    thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market
    indicators, and in times of market stress or other unforeseen
    circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become
    correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may
    move in different directions. In the past, these types of market
    movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging
    strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and
    they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can
    be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or
    trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar
    to ours. In these cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk
    positions due to the activity of other market participants. In
    addition, we are increasingly investing our own capital in our
    alternative investment and merchant banking funds, and
    limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our
    investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or
    other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the
    risk exposures relating to these investments.


 


    For a further discussion of our risk management policies and
    procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Our liquidity,
    profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an
    inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets,
    by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an inability of The
    Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to access funds from its
    subsidiaries.


 


    Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be
    impaired by an inability to access secured
    and/or
    unsecured debt markets, an inability to sell assets or redeem
    our investments, or



    
    23



Table of Contents




    unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This situation may
    arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control,
    such as a general market disruption or an operational problem
    that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception
    among market participants that we are experiencing greater
    liquidity risk. The financial instruments that we hold and the
    contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex, as
    we employ structured products to benefit our clients and
    ourselves, and these complex structured products often do not
    have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity
    stress. Growth of our proprietary investing activities may lead
    to situations where the holdings from these activities represent
    a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict
    liquidity for our positions. Further, our ability to sell assets
    may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell
    similar assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a
    liquidity or other market crisis. In addition, financial
    institutions with which we interact may exercise set-off rights
    or the right to require additional collateral, including in
    difficult market conditions, which could further impair our
    access to liquidity.


 


    Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction
    in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
    competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our
    access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under
    certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and
    collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,
    counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with
    Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.
    Termination of our trading and collateralized financing
    contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our
    liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or
    to make significant cash payments or securities movements.


 


    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a holding company and,
    therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other
    payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to
    fund all payments on its obligations, including debt
    obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co.,
    are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or
    reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to The Goldman
    Sachs Group, Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede
    access to funds that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to make
    payments on obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend
    payments.


 



    Our
    businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely
    affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults
    by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets
    or whose securities or obligations we hold.


 


    The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been
    increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth and
    size of the entities to which we have credit exposures. We are
    exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,
    securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.
    These parties may default on their obligations to us due to
    bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
    reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against
    third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In
    addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties
    whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses
    and/or
    adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use
    those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A
    significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our
    counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.
    While in many cases we are permitted to require additional
    collateral from counterparties that experience financial
    difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we
    are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The
    termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may
    subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.
    Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to
    the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market
    stress and illiquidity.


 


    In addition, as part of our clearing business, we finance our
    client positions, and we could be held responsible for the
    defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly
    review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties
    and to specific industries, countries and regions that we
    believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from
    events or circumstances that are



    
    24



Table of Contents




    difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or
    a default by, one institution could lead to significant
    liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions,
    which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.


 



    Concentration
    of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses.


 


    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses in our market-making, proprietary trading and investing,
    block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending
    businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our
    proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital
    to facilitate customer-driven business. The number and size of
    such transactions may affect our results of operations in a
    given period. For example, we regularly enter into large
    transactions as part of our trading businesses, including large
    blocks of securities sold in block trades rather than on a
    marketed basis. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we
    may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are
    generally favorable for our competitors. In addition, we extend
    large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.
    Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating
    or securitizing these positions could negatively affect our
    results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the
    positions, as well as the loss of revenues associated with
    selling such securities or loans.


 


    While our activities expose us to many different industries and
    counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of
    transactions with counterparties in the financial services
    industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks,
    investment funds and other institutional clients, resulting in
    significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.
    In the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a
    concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,
    borrower or issuer.


 



    The financial
    services industry is highly competitive.


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of
    factors, including transaction execution, our products and
    services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we
    will continue to experience pricing pressures in the future as
    some of our competitors seek to increase market share by
    reducing prices. Over time, there has been substantial
    consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial
    services industry. U.S. federal legislation, which
    significantly expanded the activities permissible for firms
    affiliated with a U.S. bank, has accelerated this
    consolidation and further increased competition. This trend
    toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased
    the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This
    trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and
    other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to
    commit capital to support our international operations and to
    execute large global transactions. As we expand into new
    business areas and new geographic regions, we will face
    competitors with more experience and more established
    relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants
    in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability
    to expand.


 


    Pricing and other competitive pressures in our investment
    banking business, as well as our other businesses, have
    continued to increase. For example, the trend in the
    underwriting business toward multiple book runners and
    co-managers handling transactions, where previously there would
    have been a single book runner, has adversely affected our
    business and reduced our revenues. In addition, we have
    experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend and
    price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us
    for the risks we take. In particular, corporate clients
    sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in
    connection with investment banking and other assignments.
    Finally, competitive pressures and other industry factors,
    including the increasing use by our clients of low-cost
    electronic trading, have caused and could continue to cause a
    reduction in commissions and spreads.

    We face
    enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact
    with a broader array of clients and expose us to new asset
    classes and new markets.


 


    A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and
    expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,
    directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are
    not within our traditional client base and expose us to new
    asset classes and new markets. For example, in recent years we
    have begun providing loans to small and mid-sized businesses,
    originating and acquiring life insurance policies and
    originating residential mortgages, and we are increasingly
    transacting business and investing in new regions, including a
    wider range of emerging markets. In addition, we are
    increasingly offering complex structured products, including
    securitized derivatives, and alternative investments to a wider
    investor base, including retail investors, both directly and
    through third-party distribution channels. Furthermore, a number
    of our businesses, including our proprietary investing and
    merchant banking activities, cause us to directly or indirectly
    own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the
    ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports,
    toll roads, shipping ports, electric power generation facilities
    and other commodities infrastructure components, both within and
    outside the United States. Recent market conditions are likely
    to lead to an increase in opportunities to acquire distressed
    assets, and we may determine opportunistically to increase our
    exposure to these types of assets. These business activities
    expose us to new and enhanced risks, including reputational
    concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated
    counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of
    these activities, increased credit-related and operational
    risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and
    reputational concerns with the manner in which these assets are
    being operated or held.


 



    Derivative
    transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential
    losses.


 


    We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,
    including credit derivatives that require that we deliver to the
    counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation
    in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not
    hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may
    have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the
    underlying security, loan or other obligation through the
    physical settlement of other transactions. As a result, we are
    subject to the risk that we may not be able to obtain the
    security, loan or other obligation within the required
    contractual time frame for delivery, particularly if default
    rates increase from the historically low levels over the past
    several years. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due
    to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with
    the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased
    costs to the firm.


 


    Derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with
    third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on
    a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we
    are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the
    event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the
    contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivative
    products are created, covering a wider array of underlying
    credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the
    underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability
    to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and
    subject us to increased costs.


 



    A failure in
    our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third
    parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses,
    result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our
    reputation and cause losses.


 


    Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or
    systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial
    loss, disruption of our businesses, liability to clients,
    regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Our businesses
    are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a
    daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are
    highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many
    currencies. These transactions, as well as information
    technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to
    client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory
    standards. As our client base and our geographical reach
    expands, developing and maintaining our operational systems and
    infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging. Our financial,
    accounting,



    
    26



Table of Contents




    data processing or other operating systems and facilities may
    fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of
    events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as
    a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability
    to process these transactions or provide these services. The
    inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of
    transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our
    businesses.


 


    We also face the risk of operational failure, termination or
    capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges,
    clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to
    facilitate our securities transactions, and as our
    interconnectivity with our clients grows, we will increasingly
    face the risk of operational failure with respect to our
    clients’ systems. In recent years, there has been
    significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and
    clearing houses, which has increased our exposure to operational
    failure, termination or capacity constraints of the particular
    financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our
    ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the
    event of any such failure, termination or constraint. Any such
    failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our
    ability to effect transactions, service our clients and manage
    our exposure to risk.


 


    Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place,
    our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
    disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses
    and the communities in which we are located. This may include a
    disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation
    or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with
    which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur, for
    example, as a result of events that affect only the buildings of
    Goldman Sachs or such third parties, or as a result of events
    with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities
    where those buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees
    in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan
    area, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, work in
    close proximity to one another, in one or more buildings.
    Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity,
    given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our
    employees are in the New York metropolitan area, depending on
    the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event
    impacting our New York metropolitan area offices could very
    negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one
    location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy
    our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations,
    our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer,
    and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency
    plans that depend on communication or travel.


 


    Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
    transmission of confidential and other information in our
    computer systems and networks. Although we take protective
    measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,
    our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to
    unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code
    and other events that could have a security impact. If one or
    more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our
    or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and
    other information processed and stored in, and transmitted
    through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
    interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, our
    counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which
    could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We
    may be required to expend significant additional resources to
    modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate
    vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to
    litigation and financial losses that are either not insured
    against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by
    us.


 


    We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and
    proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We
    have discussed and worked with clients and counterparties to
    develop secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have,
    and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all
    of our clients and counterparties. An interception or
    mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information
    being sent to or received from a client or counterparty could
    result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational
    harm. We are exposed to similar risks arising from the
    interception of personal, confidential or proprietary
    information sent to or received from, or the misuse or
    mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information
    by, vendors, service



    
    27

    providers and other third parties who may receive such
    information from us, and our efforts to ensure that these third
    parties have appropriate controls in place may not be successful.


 



    Conflicts of
    interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify
    and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our
    businesses.


 


    Our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have
    expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we
    increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest,
    including situations where our services to a particular client
    or our own proprietary investments or other interests conflict,
    or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another
    client, as well as situations where one or more of our
    businesses have access to material non-public information that
    may not be shared with other businesses within the firm.


 


    The SEC, the NYSE, FINRA, other federal and state regulators and
    regulators outside the United States, including in the United
    Kingdom and Japan, have announced their intention to increase
    their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, including
    through detailed examinations of specific transactions. There
    have been complaints filed against financial institutions,
    including Goldman Sachs, alleging the violation of antitrust
    laws arising from their joint participation in certain leveraged
    buyouts, referred to as “club deals,” as discussed
    under “Legal Proceedings — Private
    Equity-Sponsored Acquisitions Litigation” in Part I,
    Item 3 of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    In addition, a number of class action complaints have also been
    filed in connection with certain specific “club deal”
    transactions which name the relevant “club deal”
    participants among the defendants, including Goldman Sachs
    affiliates in several cases, and generally allege that the
    transactions constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the target
    company and that the “club” participants aided and
    abetted such breach. We cannot predict the outcome of the
    litigation to which we are a party, and we may become subject to
    further litigation or regulatory scrutiny in the future in this
    regard.


 


    We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to
    identify and address conflicts of interest, including those
    designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among
    our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing
    with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our
    reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to
    enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may
    be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and deal
    appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential
    or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or
    enforcement actions.


 



    Our businesses
    and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive
    regulation around the world.


 


    Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services
    industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions
    around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention
    by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we
    conduct our businesses. Among other things, we could be fined,
    prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or
    subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.


 


    New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing
    laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our
    clients may also adversely affect our businesses. Regulatory
    changes could lead to business disruptions, could require us to
    change certain of our business practices and could expose us to
    additional costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm.
    For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our
    businesses are subject, see “Business —
    Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements at a
    number of levels, as described above under
    “Business — Regulation” in Part I,
    Item 1 of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    As a Consolidated Supervised Entity, we are subject to minimum
    capital standards on a consolidated basis. A number of our
    subsidiaries, including GS&Co., GSEC, GSI, GS Bank USA, our
    Irish banking entities, GSJCL and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    oHG, are separately subject to their own minimum capital



    
    28



Table of Contents




    requirements imposed by various regulatory bodies. Complying
    with these requirements may cause us to limit our business
    activities or require us to liquidate assets or otherwise raise
    capital in a manner that adversely affects our shareholders and
    creditors. While we currently disclose these ratios to the SEC
    and the FSA and to rating agencies, we may be required or may
    determine to disclose publicly our group-wide Consolidated
    Supervised Entity capital ratios beginning in mid-2008. It is
    unclear how our ratios will compare to those of our competitors,
    or how our investors, counterparties or clients may react to any
    difference, positive or negative, in such ratios.


 


    Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in
    a difficult regulatory environment. The industry has experienced
    increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, both within and
    outside the United States. Penalties and fines sought by
    regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the
    last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely
    in recent years to commence enforcement actions. For example,
    regulators, both within and outside the United States, continue
    to scrutinize complex, structured finance transactions and have
    brought enforcement actions against a number of financial
    institutions in connection with such transactions. We seek to
    create innovative solutions to address our clients’ needs,
    and we have entered into, and continue to enter into, structured
    transactions with clients.


 


    This environment has led some of our clients to be less willing
    to engage in transactions that may carry a risk of increased
    scrutiny by regulators and has created uncertainty with respect
    to a number of transactions that had historically been entered
    into by financial services firms, including our firm, and that
    were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. This
    environment also has led us and our competitors to modify
    transaction structures and, in some cases, to limit or cease our
    execution of some types of transactions. While we have policies
    and procedures in place that are intended to ensure that the
    transactions we enter into are appropriately reviewed and comply
    with applicable laws and regulations, it is possible that
    certain transactions could give rise to litigation or
    enforcement actions or that the regulatory scrutiny of, and
    litigation in connection with, transactions will make our
    clients less willing to enter into these transactions with us,
    and will adversely affect our business.


 



    Substantial
    legal liability or significant regulatory action against Goldman
    Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause
    significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn
    could seriously harm our business prospects.


 


    We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the
    volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial
    institutions remain high. See “Legal Proceedings” in
    Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are
    involved.


 


    There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
    fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
    industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee
    misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or
    prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to
    prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
    cases.


 



    The growth of
    electronic trading and the introduction of new technology may
    adversely affect our business and may increase
    competition.


 


    Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The
    growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new
    technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with
    new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are
    increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems
    and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears
    that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue
    and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading
    systems compete with our trading businesses, including our
    specialist businesses, and we may experience continued
    competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the
    increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading
    systems and direct electronic access to trading



    
    29



Table of Contents




    markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As
    our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in
    the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use
    of our order routing and execution infrastructure. The
    NYSE’s adoption and continued refinement of its hybrid
    market for trading securities may increase pressure on our
    Equities business as customers execute more of their
    NYSE-related trades electronically. We have invested significant
    resources into the development of electronic trading systems and
    expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the
    revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate
    return on our investment, particularly given the relatively
    lower commissions arising from electronic trades.


 



    Our businesses
    may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain
    qualified employees.


 


    Competition from within the financial services industry and from
    businesses outside the financial services industry, such as
    hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, for
    qualified employees is intense. This is particularly the case in
    emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified
    employees with entities that have a significantly greater
    presence or more extensive experience in the region. Our
    performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of
    highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability to
    compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new
    businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to
    attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing
    employees. In addition, current and future laws (including laws
    relating to immigration and outsourcing) may restrict our
    ability to move responsibilities or personnel from one
    jurisdiction to another. This may impact our ability to take
    advantage of business opportunities or potential efficiencies.


 



    Our power
    generation interests and related activities subject us to
    extensive regulation, as well as environmental and other risks
    associated with power generation activities.


 


    The power generation facilities that we own and those that we
    operate, as well as our other power-related activities, are
    subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
    energy, environmental and other governmental laws and
    regulations, including environmental laws and regulations
    relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste
    management, natural resources, site remediation and health and
    safety. In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of the
    energy market by federal, state and local authorities and the
    public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal
    proceedings involving companies engaged in electric power
    generation and wholesale sales and trading of electricity and
    natural gas.


 


    In addition, we may incur substantial costs in complying with
    current or future laws and regulations relating to power
    generation, including having to commit significant capital
    toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution
    control equipment, payment of emission fees and carbon or other
    taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses
    at our power generation facilities. In certain instances,
    compliance with applicable laws and regulations may require us
    to cease or curtail operations of one or more of our power
    generation facilities.


 


    Our power generation facilities are also subject to the risk of
    unforeseen or catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks,
    natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. We
    may not have insurance against these risks or other risks,
    including environmental risks, that such facilities face, and,
    in cases in which we do have insurance, the insurance proceeds
    may be inadequate to cover our losses. Our overall businesses
    and reputation may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory
    proceedings, particularly those related to environmental
    matters, arising out of our power generation business, as well
    as by the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events or
    negative publicity associated with our power-related activities.


 


    The operation of our power generation facilities may be
    disrupted for many reasons, many of which are outside our
    control, including the breakdown or failure of power generation
    equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes,
    and performance below expected levels of output

    or efficiency. In addition, these facilities could be adversely
    affected by the failure of any of our third-party suppliers or
    service providers to perform their contractual obligations,
    including the failure to obtain raw materials necessary for
    operation at reasonable prices. Market conditions or other
    factors could cause a failure to satisfy or obtain waivers under
    agreements with third parties, including lenders and utilities,
    which impose significant obligations on our subsidiaries that
    own such facilities. The occurrence of any of such events may
    prevent the affected facilities from performing under applicable
    power sales agreements, may impair their operations or financial
    results and may result in litigation or other reputational harm.


 



    In conducting
    our businesses around the world, we are subject to political,
    economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent
    in operating in many countries.


 


    In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to risks of possible
    nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital
    controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
    actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities. In many
    countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities
    and financial services industries and many of the transactions
    in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may
    be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local
    laws in every market. Any determination by local regulators that
    we have not acted in compliance with the application of local
    laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective
    working relationships with local regulators could have a
    significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in
    that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also
    subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure
    might not be legally enforceable in all cases.


 


    Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into
    new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets,
    and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging market
    countries have experienced severe economic and financial
    disruptions, including significant devaluations of their
    currencies, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or
    negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects
    of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our
    businesses and increased volatility in financial markets
    generally.
