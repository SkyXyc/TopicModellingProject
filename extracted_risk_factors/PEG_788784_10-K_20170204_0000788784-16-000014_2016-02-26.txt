. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Financing Receivables.In accordance with a twelve year Amended and Restated Operations Services Agreement (OSA) entered into by PSEG LI and the LIPA, PSEG LI commenced operating LIPA’s electric T&D system in Long Island, New York on January 1, 2014. As required by the OSA, PSEG LI also provides certain administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI uses its brand in the Long Island T&D service area. Pursuant to the OSA, PSEG LI acts as LIPA's agent in performing many of its obligations and in return (a) receives reimbursement for pass-through operating expenditures, (b) receives a fixed management fee and (c) is eligible to receive an incentive fee contingent on meeting established performance metrics. In addition, there is the opportunity for the parties to extend the contract for an additional eight years subject to the achievement by PSEG LI of certain performance levels during the initial term of the OSA. Also, as of January 2015, Power began providing fuel procurement and power management services to LIPA under separate agreements.  COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTPSE&GOur transmission and distribution business is minimally impacted when customers choose alternate electric or gas suppliers since we earn our return by providing transmission and distribution service, not by supplying the commodity. Increased reliance by customers on net-metered generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors can result in decreased reliance on our system and impact our revenues and investment opportunities. The demand for electric energy and gas by customers is affected by customer conservation, economic conditions, weather and other factors not within our control.Changes in the current policies for building new transmission lines, such as those ordered by FERC and being implemented by PJM and other ISOs to eliminate contractual provisions that previously provided us a “right of first refusal” (ROFR) to 14table of contentsconstruct projects in our service territory, could result in third party construction of transmission lines in our area in the future and also allow us to seek opportunities to build in other service territories. These implementing rules within the regions are still in flux so both the extent of the risk within our service territory and the opportunities for our transmission business elsewhere remain difficult to assess. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation—Transmission Regulation, below.Construction of new local generation also has the potential to reduce the need for the construction of new transmission to transport remote generation and alleviate system constraints.PowerVarious market participants compete with us and one another in buying and selling in the wholesale energy markets, entering into bilateral contracts and selling to aggregated retail customers. Our competitors include:•merchant generators,•domestic and multi-national utility generators,•energy marketers,•banks, funds and other financial entities,•fuel supply companies, and•affiliates of other industrial companies.New additions of lower-cost or more efficient generation capacity could make our plants less economic in the future. Although it is not clear if this capacity will be built or, if so, what the economic impact will be, such additions would impact market prices and our competitiveness.Our business is also under competitive pressure due to demand side management (DSM) and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of usage by consumers which could result in a reduction in load requirements. A reduction in load requirements can also be caused by economic cycles, weather, municipal aggregation and other customer migration and other factors. In addition, how resources such as demand response and capacity imports are permitted to bid into the capacity markets also affects the prices paid to generators such as Power in these markets. It is also possible that advances in technology, such as distributed generation and micro grids, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. To the extent that additions to the electric transmission system relieve or reduce limitations and constraints in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, our revenues could be adversely affected. Changes in the rules governing what types of transmission will be built, who is selected to build transmission and who will pay the costs of future transmission could also impact our revenues.Adverse changes in energy industry law, policies and regulation, including market structures and a potential shift away from competitive markets toward subsidized market mechanisms, would have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market and thus have the potential to harm competitive markets, on both a short-term and a long-term basis. At the same time, changes implemented in the PJM and New England capacity markets and other proposed market changes discussed more fully in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation provide the opportunity for additional compensation in both the energy and capacity markets.Environmental issues, such as restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants, may also have a competitive impact on us to the extent that it becomes more expensive for some of our plants to remain compliant, thus affecting our ability to be a lower-cost provider compared to competitors without such restrictions. In addition, most of our plants, which are located in the Northeast where rules are more stringent, can be at an economic disadvantage compared to our competitors in certain Midwest states. If any new legislation or regulations were to require our competitors to meet the environmental standards currently imposed upon us, we would likely have an economic advantage since we have already installed significant pollution-control technology at most of our fossil-fueled stations. In addition, pressures from renewable resources could increase over time. For example, many parts of the country, including the mid-western region served by the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), the PJM region and the California ISO, have either implemented or proposed implementing changes to their respective regional transmission planning processes that may enable the construction of large amounts of “public policy” transmission to move renewable generation to load centers. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulations—Transmission Regulation.15table of contentsEMPLOYEE RELATIONSAs of December 31, 2015, we had 13,025 employees within our subsidiaries, including 8,111 covered under collective bargaining agreements. Two of our collective bargaining union agreements will expire in November 2016, five in April 2017, two in October 2017, and one in May 2018. We believe we maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees.

PSE&G and the generation and energy trading subsidiaries of Power are public utilities as defined by the FPA. FERC has extensive oversight over such public utilities. FERC approval is usually required when a public utility seeks to: sell or acquire an asset that is regulated by FERC (such as a transmission line or a generating station); collect costs from customers associated with a new transmission facility; charge a rate for wholesale sales under a contract or tariff; or engage in certain mergers and internal corporate reorganizations.FERC also regulates generating facilities known as qualifying facilities (QFs). QFs are cogeneration facilities that produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, or small power production facilities where the primary energy source is renewable, biomass, waste or geothermal resources. QFs must meet certain criteria established by FERC. We own various QFs through Power. QFs are subject to some, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities.FERC also regulates Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs)/ISOs, such as PJM, and their energy and capacity markets.For us, the major effects of FERC regulation fall into five general categories:•Regulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market Power•Energy Clearing Prices•Capacity Market Issues•Transmission Regulation•ComplianceRegulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market PowerUnder FERC regulations, public utilities must receive FERC authorization to sell power in interstate commerce. They can sell power at cost-based rates or apply to FERC for authority to make market-based rate (MBR) sales. For a requesting company to receive MBR authority, FERC must first make a determination that the requesting company lacks market power in the relevant markets and/or that market power in the relevant markets is sufficiently mitigated. FERC requires that holders of MBR tariffs file an update every three years demonstrating that they continue to lack market power and/or that their market power has been sufficiently mitigated and report in the interim to FERC any material change in facts from those FERC relied on in granting MBR authority.  PSE&G, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC, PSEG Power Connecticut, PSEG Fossil LLC, PSEG Nuclear LLC and PSEG New Haven LLC all were granted MBR authority from FERC in October 2014. In order to retain its MBR authority, each of these entities will be required to submit its power uprate compliance filing to FERC by the end of December 2016. 16table of contentsEnergy Clearing PricesEnergy clearing prices in the markets in which we operate are generally based on bids submitted by generating units. Under FERC-approved market rules, bids are subject to price caps and mitigation rules applicable to certain generation units. FERC rules also govern the overall design of these markets. At present, all units within a delivery zone receive a clearing price based on the bid of the marginal unit (i.e. the last unit that must be dispatched to serve the needs of load) which can vary by location. In addition, recent rule changes in the energy markets administered by PJM and ISO-NE (see Capacity Market Issues below) impose rigorous performance obligations and nonperformance penalties on resources during times of system stress. These FERC rules have a direct impact on the prices received by our units.FERC has also recently ordered certain favorable changes to energy market price formation rules improving shortage pricing and enhancing bidding flexibility for units. We continue to advocate in this context for additional changes in market rules that would provide more transparency about energy market prices. We cannot predict what action FERC might ultimately take, but such an examination could lead to future rule changes. Capacity Market IssuesPJM, the NYISO and the ISO-NE each have capacity markets that have been approved by FERC. FERC regulates these markets and continues to examine whether the market design for each of these three capacity markets is working optimally. Issues presented in various forums include consideration of whether capacity market rules properly address and foster the development of state public policies, demand response (DR) and emerging technologies, whether generators are being sufficiently compensated in the capacity market and whether subsidized resources may be adversely affecting capacity market outcomes. We cannot predict what action, if any, FERC might take with regard to capacity market design.PJM—The RPM is the locational installed capacity market design for the PJM region, including a forward auction for installed capacity. Under the RPM, generators located in constrained areas within PJM are paid more for their capacity as an incentive to ensure adequate supply where generation capacity is most needed. The mechanics of the RPM in PJM continue to evolve and be refined in stakeholder proceedings and FERC proceedings in which we are active. During 2015, PJM implemented a new “Capacity Performance” (CP) mechanism that created a more robust capacity product definition with enhanced incentives for performance during emergency conditions and significant penalties for non-performance. However, aspects of FERC’s order are currently pending on rehearing before the FERC Commission and, ultimately, appeals of FERC’s rehearing order are likely. The CP mechanism was implemented for the 2015 base residual auction (covering the 2018-2019 Delivery Year) which concluded on August 21, 2015. The CP product will be implemented fully for the 2020-2021 Delivery Year. Based upon the August 2015 base residual auction results, the CP mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for Power but future impacts cannot be assured. Further compliance with the CP mechanism may entail additional performance risks and require additional investments.In May 2014, in a case involving the proper level of compensation for DR resources in the energy markets, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (D.C. Court) held that DR is not a FERC-jurisdictional product, thereby calling into question DR resources’ ability to participate in either the energy or capacity markets in the future. In January 2015, FERC filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Court's ruling. In January 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the D.C. Court’s ruling and determined that FERC has the authority to regulate wholesale DR and market operators’ compensation of DR bids at full market value. This ruling removes any risk to DR’s participation in the energy and capacity markets. As a result, we expect activity to continue at the PJM stakeholder process regarding eligibility criteria for DR, including as a CP resource.In September 2014, PJM filed at FERC to re-set the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve for the RPM. PJM expects to reset the VRR every four years. Establishment of the VRR curve is a critical component in determining how generators are paid in the capacity auction. In November 2014, FERC accepted PJM’s filing, which we believe represents an improvement over the status quo in terms of appropriately setting the demand curve. However, we and other generators have challenged FERC’s approval order on rehearing, taking exception to FERC’s approval of the manner in which PJM calculated the cost of capital and labor costs that form the basis for the Cost of New Entry component of the demand curve, which we believe have been set too low and do not accurately reflect the costs of building a new generating unit in PJM. Rehearing was denied in December 2015 and the PSEG Companies, and a trade association, have sought review of FERC’s order at the D.C. Court. An emerging issue in PJM involves the impact of subsidized generation on RPM market outcomes. This issue is most directly presented in connection with proposals pending before the Ohio Public Utility Commission whereby First Energy Corp. and American Electric Power are proposing to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with their non-utility generation affiliates providing for above-market purchases from certain coal plants and a nuclear plant. The subsidies under these contracts would likely enable the affected generators to submit reduced bids into PJM capacity markets that are not reflective of their actual costs of operation and may prevent uneconomic generating facilities from retiring. Either of these conditions could artificially suppress capacity market prices, especially given that PJM’s currently effective “minimum offer price rule” (MOPR) would not apply to these plants as the MOPR only applies to new gas-fired units.17table of contentsWe are unable to predict the results of these pending proceedings or any future related proceedings or to calculate the potential impacts on our business.        MISO—MISO does not have a mandatory capacity market in place, as load serving entities may submit Fixed Resource Adequacy Plans in lieu of participating in the capacity auction. Significant quantities of capacity from MISO are imported into PJM which tends to have a downward effect on PJM capacity prices. However, recent enhancements to PJM market rules have tightened eligibility requirements for PJM imports and reduced these impacts. The issue of "capacity portability" from MISO continues to be examined in the stakeholder process.ISO-NE—ISO-NE’s market for installed capacity in New England provides fixed capacity payments for generators, imports and DR. The market design consists of a forward-looking auction for installed capacity that is intended to recognize the locational value of resources on the system and contains incentive mechanisms to encourage availability during stressed system conditions. ISO-NE also employs a mechanism, similar to PJM’s CP mechanism, that provides incentives for performance and that imposes penalties for non-performance during times of system stress. We view this mechanism as generally positive for generating resources as providing more robust income streams. However, it also imposes additional penalty risk for non-performance. One aspect of the current market design that we do not support is the exemption from the MOPR in the capacity market afforded for up to 200 MW annually (600 MW cumulatively) of renewable resources. We believe that the exemption is unduly discriminatory and will artificially suppress capacity prices. In March 2015, in conjunction with other companies, we filed a petition for review with the D.C. Court of FERC's ruling accepting the exemption. On December 1, 2015, following a request by FERC for a voluntary remand of the order, the D.C. Court remanded the case to FERC for additional consideration. Also in December 2015, ISO-NE filed a proposal that would allow resource owners to submit bids in the capacity auction reflecting their desire to retire a resource. However, this proposal also includes elements which we believe would have an unwarranted disruptive effect on efficient price formation in the capacity market. We have filed in opposition to this proposal. Finally, demand curves for ISO-NE capacity zones, including potential changes to the system-wide demand curves, are under consideration in an ISO-NE stakeholder process. These curves could have a significant impact upon the revenues our generation can expect to receive in the capacity market in New England. NYISO—NYISO operates a short-term capacity market that provides a forward price signal only for six months into the future. Various matters pending before FERC could affect the competitiveness of this market and the outcome of these proceedings could result in artificial price suppression unless sufficient market protections are adopted.  One capacity market matter pending before FERC involves rules to govern payments and bidding requirements for generators proposing to exit the market but required to remain in service for reliability reasons. On March 19, 2015, FERC issued an order which held that units receiving special reliability payments could properly take those payments into account in formulating capacity market bids. We believe that this ruling could impact efficient price formation in the capacity market and could artificially suppress capacity market outcomes. On April 20, 2015, a trade association, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (IPPNY) of which Power is a member filed for rehearing by FERC of this ruling. This rehearing is still pending. Also, in connection with this same proceeding, FERC required NYISO to submit a report addressing whether buyer-side mitigation measures are needed for new entry occurring in the “Rest of State” region and for uneconomic retention and repowering anywhere in the state. NYISO filed a report with FERC in December 2015 contending that these measures are not needed. The IPPNY has opposed NYISO’s contentions. In addition, on May 8, 2015, the New York Public Service Commission and other New York agencies filed a complaint at FERC requesting certain exemptions from the NYISO rules that prevent capacity suppliers from submitting bids that are not market competitive. On October 9, 2015, FERC granted in part, certain of the requested exemptions for renewable resources and for resources being used by the owner for self-supply. The IPPNY has sought rehearing of this order. This rehearing is still pending.  Price Formation InitiativesPower has been actively involved both through stakeholder processes and through filings at FERC in seeking improvements to the rules for setting prices for energy in the day-ahead and real-time markets administered by PJM and other system operators. A recent development which is designed to increase market transparency involves a November 20, 2015 order in which FERC directed each RTO/ISO to publicly provide information related to certain price formation issues. If FERC’s initiative leads to reforms in the identified price formation issue areas, it could result in energy market prices that more accurately reflect prevailing system conditions and the costs of operating the marginal generating units. Specifically, each RTO/ISO was required to submit information regarding: (1) the ability of inflexible resources to set price; (2) how simultaneously occurring system outages are reflected in the market model; (3) the tools to anticipate near-term system conditions; (4) the allocation of costs associated with units dispatched for reliability out-of-merit; and (5) transparency. Each RTO/ISO was also directed to file a report that provides an update on its current practices in the identified topic areas, that provides the status of its efforts (if any) to address each of the five issues, and that fully responds to the questions contained in the FERC order by March 4, 2016. Following the submission of the RTOs’/ISOs’ reports, FERC will allow for public comment. FERC will use the reports and comments to determine what further action is appropriate.18table of contentsReactive Power RatesIn June 2015, Power submitted a tariff filing with FERC to increase Power’s rates for reactive supply and voltage control service from approximately $27 million per year to about $39 million per year. The rates were last adjusted in 2008 and since that time various generating units have been de-activated, activated or improved with the net impact supportive of an upward rate adjustment. FERC accepted Power’s rate filing increase to become effective in January 2016, subject to refund, hearing and settlement procedures. FERC also referred the filing to the FERC Office of Enforcement for its evaluation. Power has participated in two settlement conferences to date with the FERC Trial Staff. Following settlement discussion with FERC Trial Staff, Power agreed to accept an overall rate of $34 million per year. Approval of this rate increase is currently pending before FERC.Long-Term Capacity Agreement Pilot Program Act (LCAPP)In 2011, the State of New Jersey enacted the LCAPP to subsidize approximately 2,000 MW of new natural gas-fired generation. The LCAPP provided that subsidies would be offered through long-term standard offer capacity agreements (SOCAs) between selected generators and the New Jersey EDCs.In 2013, the U.S. District Court in New Jersey found that the LCAPP was unconstitutional and declared the LCAPP null and void. This federal court decision was subsequently challenged on appeal in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals (Third Circuit). The State of Maryland also took similar action to subsidize above-market new generation. This action was also determined to be unconstitutional in 2013 in the U.S. District Court in Maryland and such decision was challenged in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Fourth Circuit). Both appeals were denied, with the Fourth Circuit denying the appeal regarding the State of Maryland’s action in June 2014 and the Third Circuit denying the LCAPP appeal in September 2014. These denials have been challenged on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would consider the appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision involving Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case and is expected to issue a decision in 2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this appeal.Transmission RegulationFERC has exclusive jurisdiction to establish the rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate transmission. We currently have FERC-approved formula rates in effect to recover the costs of our transmission facilities. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures. Our allowed ROE is 11.68% for both existing and new transmission investments and we have received incentive rates, affording a higher ROE, for certain large scale transmission investments. Our 2016 Formula Rate Update with FERC for approximately $146 million in increased annual transmission revenues went into effect on January 1, 2016. Each year, transmission revenues are adjusted to reflect items such as updating estimates used in the filing with actual data. The adjustment for 2016 will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after our 2016 filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2016 revenue increase as filed by approximately $27 million. For additional information about our transmission formula rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.Transmission Policy Developments—FERC concluded in Order 1000 that the incumbent transmission owner should not always have a ROFR to construct and own transmission projects in its service territory. We and other companies appealed Order 1000 but this appeal was denied in 2014 by the D.C. Court. The current PJM rules retain carve-outs for projects that will continue to default to incumbents for construction responsibility, including immediately needed reliability projects, upgrades to existing transmission facilities, projects cost-allocated to a single transmission zone, and projects being built on existing rights-of-way and whose construction would interfere with incumbents’ use of their rights-of-way. While these carve-outs ameliorate the impacts of the Order 1000 ruling, we and several other companies appealed various aspects of the FERC order approving PJM’s implementation of Order 1000 on the grounds that FERC had not met the requisite legal burden in eliminating the ROFR from the PJM Tariff. This appeal remains pending in federal court.In April 2013, PJM initiated its first "open window" solicitation process to allow both incumbents and non-incumbents the opportunity to submit transmission project proposals to address identified high voltage issues at Artificial Island in New Jersey. On July 29, 2015, the PJM Board approved the PJM staff's recommendation for a transmission project consisting of various components to be constructed by LS Power, PSE&G and Potomac Holding Company. In August 2015, PJM sent PSE&G a Construction Responsibility Letter (to which PSE&G responded on November 9 and again on February 16, 2016) awarding PSE&G three components of the project, estimated by PJM to cost approximately $126 million. PSE&G has accepted construction responsibility, subject to reaching agreement with PJM on a reasonable cost estimate. Discussions are ongoing with PJM regarding the cost estimate for PSE&G's portion of the work. On February 18, 2016, FERC issued an order granting PSE&G’s request that it be permitted to seek recovery of 100% of its portion of the Artificial Island projects costs if the project 19table of contentsis cancelled for reasons beyond PSE&G’s control. PSE&G continues to work with both PJM and its stakeholders to improve the rules governing open window processes in PJM. In a September 2015 order, FERC directed that a technical conference be held to address "concerns regarding how PJM plans for local transmission projects." Parties in the case raised concerns that too many projects are being approved outside of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) mechanism to address “local” reliability requirements without going through the Order 1000 open window process. Intervenors also complained that there is inadequate transparency regarding the PJM transmission owners’ consideration and selection of Supplemental Projects (which are not approved by the PJM Board). PSE&G is participating in the process before FERC in support of the current PJM processes. In addition, certain PJM stakeholders have proposed an examination of the current planning rules, including changes with regard to criteria to be used for replacement of facilities that have reached their “end of life.” PSE&G intends to actively participate in this process. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these efforts.In a February 2016 order, FERC reversed a previous order and accepted a filing by the PJM transmission owners seeking authority to assign costs for RTEP projects (subject to PJM Board approval requirements) solely addressing localized needs to customers within the local transmission owner’s zone. FERC’s action in this order provides an exemption from the Order 1000 open window procedures for projects constructed by transmission owners to meet local transmission planning criteria.   There are several matters pending before FERC that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by PSE&G. In addition, in a separate proceeding, a merchant transmission operator has sought rehearing of the May 2014 order granting PSE&G’s request for incentives related to the Bergen-Linden Corridor Project (BLC), solely with respect to the cost allocation for that project. That rehearing request remains pending. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE&G’s ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by ratepayers in New Jersey and may cause increased scrutiny regarding PSE&G's future capital investments. In addition, Power, as a BGS supplier, submits bids into the auction and obtains an obligation to provide services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these transmission costs, BGS suppliers may be entitled to an adjustment. However, suppliers may not be able to recoup these adjustments immediately as they are subject to BPU approval. In one proceeding, Con Edison filed a complaint against PJM at FERC in November 2014 challenging PJM's allocation of costs for two PSE&G projects in northern New Jersey, including the BLC. In June 2015, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint. Con Edison and a merchant generator have sought judicial review of certain aspects of FERC’s order and Con Edison has filed a rehearing request with FERC.Another proceeding is a matter remanded from a federal appellate court concerning the appropriate cost allocation for certain 500 kV projects in PJM that either have been built or are in the process of being built, including the Susquehanna-Roseland project. This matter is currently in advanced settlement discussions at FERC. Under possible settlement outcomes under consideration, Power, as a BGS supplier could become obligated to pay amounts previously paid by other PJM transmission customers. However, Power does not believe that the anticipated level of any such potential payments would have a material effect on Power’s financial statements.  In another complaint proceeding against PJM, in May 2015 and as amended in July 2015, a merchant transmission operator challenged PJM’s allocation of costs for four PSE&G projects, including BLC. PSE&G filed an opposition to the complaint and the matter is currently pending at FERC. In August 2015, the Delaware Public Service Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission also filed a complaint against PJM and certain transmission owners that have voting rights over cost allocation and rate design, including PSE&G, alleging that PJM tariff provisions allocate an excessive share of the Artificial Island project costs to them relative to the actual benefits of the project to residents of Delaware and Maryland. PSE&G participated in a group filing of transmission owners that opposed the complaint. PJM also answered the Delaware/Maryland complaint but stated that the Artificial Island cost allocation appeared “disproportionate” and raised “equity concerns.” On January 12, 2016, we participated in a technical conference at FERC related to PJM cost allocation with the stated purpose of determining whether special allocation rules are needed for reliability projects based upon the reliability needs other than insufficient flow capability over the affected transmission facilities. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.In June 2015, a transmission developer filed a complaint against PJM claiming that PJM wrongfully refused to provide data and a transparent process for evaluating transmission network upgrade requests that the transmission developer had submitted to PJM. According to the complaint, PJM and certain transmission owners wrongfully inflated the scope and associated costs of mitigation work needed to accommodate the developer’s proposal in order to prevent it from pursuing its projects. Although not named as a respondent in the complaint, PSE&G is identified as one of the companies claimed to have been involved. In July 2015, PJM filed a response, which included a supporting affidavit from PSE&G, contesting the allegations. Settlement conferences in this matter are currently on-going.  Transmission Rate Proceedings—Several complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners’ base ROEs. Certain of those complaints have 20table of contentsresulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners' base ROEs. While we are not the subject of a challenge to the ROE employed in PSE&G’s transmission formula rate, the results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G. ComplianceFERC Audit—In November 2012, FERC commenced an audit of each of the PSEG companies that have MBR authority from FERC. The companies were audited by FERC for compliance with its rules for (i) receiving and retaining MBR authority, (ii) the filing of electric quarterly reports (EQRs), and (iii) our generating units' receipt of payments from the RTO/ISO when they are required to run for reliability reasons when it is not economical for them to do so. On October 16, 2014, FERC issued a final, public audit report that contained two findings and recommendations for enhanced review and reporting of our EQRs. In November 2014, we submitted a compliance plan to FERC explaining how we intend to implement FERC’s recommendations and we thereafter provided quarterly updates to FERC reporting on our progress in implementing the recommendations. At this time, we have satisfied all of FERC’s requirements.FERC—For information about the preliminary non-public investigation initiated by the FERC Staff regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of Power's cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market and the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.Reliability Standards—Congress has required FERC to put in place, through the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), national and regional reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system (grid) and to prevent major system blackouts. There has been considerable focus recently on physical security in light of, among other things, a substation attack in California that occurred in 2013. As a result, FERC directed the NERC to draft a physical security standard intended to further protect assets deemed “critical” to reliability of the grid. In November 2014, FERC issued an order approving the NERC’s proposed physical security standard. Under the standard, utilities will be required to identify critical substations as well as develop threat assessment plans to be reviewed by independent third parties. In our case, the third party is PJM. As part of these plans, utilities could decide or be required to build additional redundancy into their systems. This standard will supplement the Critical Infrastructure Protection standards that are already in place and that establish physical and cybersecurity protections for critical systems. We are on schedule to meet all NERC requirements.Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC and the CFTC are in the process of implementing a new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The legislation was enacted to reduce systemic risk, increase transparency and promote market integrity within thefinancial system by providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers and by imposing recordkeeping, data reporting, margin and clearing requirements with respect to swaps. To implement the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has engaged in a comprehensive rulemaking process and has issued a number of proposed and final rules addressing many of the key issues. We are currently subject to record keeping and data reporting requirements applicable to commercial end users. The CFTC has also proposed rules establishing position limits for trading in certain commodities, such as natural gas, and we are currently analyzing the potential impact of these rules on our business. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)Our operation of nuclear generating facilities is subject to comprehensive regulation by the NRC, a federal agency established to regulate nuclear activities to ensure protection of public health and safety, as well as the security and protection of the environment. Such regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety and environmental requirements. Continuous demonstration to the NRC that plant operations meet requirements is also necessary. The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating unit may operate. The current operating licenses of our nuclear facilities expire in the years shown in the following table:       Unit Year  Salem Unit 1 2036  Salem Unit 2 2040  Hope Creek 2046  Peach Bottom Unit 2 2033  Peach Bottom Unit 3 2034      21table of contentsAs a result of events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the NRC began performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States. These reviews and the lessons learned from the events in Japan have resulted in additional regulation for the nuclear industry and could impact future operations and capital requirements for our facilities. We believe that our nuclear plants currently meet the stringent applicable design and safety specifications of the NRC. In 2011, a NRC task force submitted a report containing various recommendations to ensure plant protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve NRC program efficiency. The NRC staff also issued a document which provided for a prioritization of the task force recommendations. The NRC approved the staff's prioritization and implementation recommendations subject to a number of conditions. Among other things, the NRC advised the staff to give the highest priority to those activities that can achieve the greatest safety benefit and/or have the broadest applicability (Tier 1), to review filtration of boiling water reactor (BWR) primary containment vents and encouraged the staff to create requirements based on a performance-based system which allows for flexible approaches and the ability to address a diverse range of site-specific circumstances and conditions and strive to implement the requirements in 2016. The NRC issued letters and orders to licensees implementing the Tier 1 recommendations in March 2012. In March 2013, the NRC initiated a rulemaking process for improvements to venting systems at 31 U.S. BWRs with “Mark I” and “Mark II” containments (similar to those at Fukushima), which include our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units. In June 2013, the NRC issued orders requiring Mark I and Mark II licensees to upgrade or replace their reliable hardened vents with containment venting systems designed and installed to remain functional during severe accident conditions. We are implementing the diverse and flexible strategies and spent fuel pool level indication modifications in accordance with the regulatory requirements at the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom nuclear units. For our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units, final installation of the required modifications is expected to occur during the planned refueling outages in 2016-2018.The NRC is currently developing the regulatory basis for drywell filtration strategies rulemaking. The NRC expects to complete its evaluation and vote on a final rule in 2017. The NRC continues to evaluate potential revisions to its requirements in connection with its operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi incident. We are unable to predict the final outcome of these reviews or the cost of any actions we would need to take to comply with any new regulations, including possible modifications to our Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom facilities, but such cost could be material.State RegulationSince our operations are primarily located within New Jersey, our principal state regulator is the BPU, which oversees electric and natural gas distribution companies in New Jersey. We are also subject to various other states’ regulations due to our operations in those states.  Our New Jersey utility operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the BPU including, among other matters, regulation of retail electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuance and sale of certain types of securities and compliance matters. PSE&G's participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs is also regulated by the BPU, as the terms and conditions of these programs are approved by the BPU. BPU regulation can also have a direct or indirect impact on our power generation business as it relates to energy supply agreements and energy policy in New Jersey.We must file electric and gas rate cases with the BPU in order to change our utility base distribution rates. Our last base rate case was settled in 2010. As a result of our Energy Strong order discussed below, we are required to file our next base rate case proceeding no later than November 1, 2017. In addition to base rates, we recover certain costs or earn on certain investments pursuant to mechanisms known as adjustment clauses. These clauses permit the flow-through of costs to, or the recovery of investments from, customers related to specific programs, outside the context of base rate case proceedings. Recovery of these costs or investments is subject to BPU approval for which we make periodic filings. Delays in the pass-through of costs or recovery of investments under these mechanisms could result in significant changes in cash flow. For additional information on our specific filings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. Energy Strong Program—In May 2014, the BPU issued an Order approving our Energy Strong program which provides for investment in our BPU jurisdictional electric and gas system to improve resiliency for the future. Under the settlement, PSE&G will invest up to $1.2 billion over an initial five-year period. The Order provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of ROE on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated Allowance for Funds Used Under Construction, and will occur for completed projects on a semi-annual (for electric investments) or annual (for gas investments) basis. We will seek recovery of the remaining investment in PSE&G's next base rate case. See Business—PSE&G—Distribution for additional information about Energy Strong.22table of contentsDuring 2015, the BPU approved two Energy Strong petitions which allow us to recover in base rates capitalized Energy Strong investment costs for projects placed in service through May 31, 2015. The BPU Orders provide for a total $24 million annual revenue increase. Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP)—In November 2015, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our GSMP through which PSE&G will invest $905 million over the next three years to modernize its gas system. The settlement enables the utility to replace up to 510 miles of gas mains and 38,000 service lines over a three-year period, with cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on $650 million of the investment through an accelerated recovery mechanism. Under the settlement, PSE&G will seek recovery of the remaining $255 million of investment in its next base rate case. We expect to file our first investment recovery petition in 2016. Connecticut Rate Filing—In June 2015, Power’s subsidiary, PSEG New Haven LLC, filed a mandatory annual rate case with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) for recovery of its costs and investment in its Connecticut-based PSEG New Haven LCC peaking units. Power requested 2016 revenues of $21 million. On November 18, 2015, PURA issued a Final Decision to approve the entirety of Power’s request. The newly approved rates are effective as of January 1, 2016.Consolidated Tax Adjustments (CTA)—New Jersey is one of only a few states that make CTA in setting rates for regulated utilities. These adjustments to rate base are made during the rate setting process and are intended to allocate to utility customers a portion of the tax benefits realized from the filing of a consolidated federal tax return by the utility’s parent corporation. The BPU has been considering the appropriateness of the adjustment and the methodology and mechanics of the calculation for some time. On October 22, 2014, the BPU approved a proposal by its Staff that limits the tax benefit period to be considered in the calculation to five years, sets the rate base adjustment at 25% of any such tax benefit and eliminates from the process any tax benefits tied to transmission earnings. In accordance with this October action, this CTA policy will be applied only with respect to future rate cases. The adoption of these modifications by the BPU is not expected to have a material impact on PSE&G’s current earnings nor in its next rate case filing. On November 5, 2014, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel appealed the BPU's decision. All briefs have been filed and the appeal remains pending. New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP)—New Jersey law requires that an EMP be developed every three years, the purpose of which is to ensure safe, secure and reasonably-priced energy supply, foster economic growth and development and protect the environment. While not having the force of law, the EMP provides an overview of energy policy in New Jersey and may provide both opportunities and challenges for PSEG. The most recent EMP was finalized in December 2011 and placed an emphasis on expanding in-state electricity resources, reducing energy costs, recognizing the impact of climate change and setting new targets for a renewable portfolio standard and goals for energy supplies from clean energy sources. An update to the December 2011 EMP was released on December 31, 2015 which continued to emphasize the policies set forth in the December 2011 EMP while also addressing certain issues that have emerged since that time, placing an emphasis on improved system resiliency, critical energy infrastructure, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity.  Additional matters are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to environmental matters including, but not limited to:•air pollution control,•climate change,•water pollution control,•hazardous substance liability, and•fuel and waste disposal.Changing environmental laws and regulations significantly impact the manner in which our operations are currently conducted and impose costs on us to reduce the health and environmental impacts of our operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. To the extent that environmental requirements are more stringent and compliance more costly in certain states where we operate compared to other states that are part of the same market, such rules may impact our ability to compete within that market. Due to evolving environmental regulations, it is difficult to project future costs of compliance and their impact on competition. Capital costs of complying with known pollution control requirements are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed by future regulations are not known, but may be material.23table of contentsFor additional information related to environmental matters, including proceedings not discussed below, as well as anticipated expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, hazardous substance liabilities and fuel and waste disposal costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.Air Pollution ControlOur facilities are subject to federal regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires controls of emissions from sources of air pollution and imposes record keeping, reporting and permit requirements. Our facilities are also subject to requirements established under state and local air pollution laws. The CAA requires all major sources, such as our generation facilities, to obtain and keep current an operating permit. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed and included in these permits in the future could be material and are not included in our estimates of capital expenditures.•Hazardous Air Pollutants Regulation—In February 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for both newly-built and existing electric generating sources under the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) provisions of the CAA. The MATS established allowable levels for mercury as well as other hazardous air pollutants and went into effect in April 2015. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable for the EPA to refuse to consider the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants and remanded the matter back to the D.C. Court. On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Court remanded the MATS to the EPA without vacating the rule. On December 1, 2015, the EPA proposed a Supplemental Finding that considers the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling. •Demand Response (DR) Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) Litigation—In March 2013, Power filed a petition at the EPA challenging the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for RICE issued in January 2013. Among other things, the NESHAP include two exemptions that allow owners and operators of stationery emergency RICE to operate their engines without the installation and operation of emission controls (1) as part of an emergency DR program for 100 hours per year (100 hour exemption) or (2) as part of a financial arrangement with another entity per specified restrictions in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year (50 hour exemption). This waiver of NESHAP standards results in disparate treatment of different generation technology types. In its appeal, Power sought more stringent emission control standards for RICE to support more competitive markets, particularly the PJM capacity market. In August 2014, the EPA denied the March 2013 petition and in October 2014, Power appealed the EPA's denial to the D.C. Court. On May 1, 2015, the D.C. Court vacated the 100 hour exemption but thereafter granted a stay until May 1, 2016. On September 23, 2015, the D.C. Court granted the EPA's motion for voluntary remand of the 50 hour exemption provision to the EPA. While both provisions remain in place, the EPA will undergo proceedings to address the D.C. Court's orders. We believe that the impact of the D.C. Court's rulings would likely benefit Power's and its competitors' operations of their power generation peaking units.• Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)—On January 1, 2015, the final CSAPR became effective which limits power plant emissions of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and annual and ozone season nitrogen oxide (NO) in 28 states that contribute to the ability of downwind states to attain and/or maintain the 1997 and 2006 particulate matter and the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). On April 6, 2015, the EPA revoked the 1997 ozone NAAQS of 80 parts per billion (ppb) and began implementation of the more stringent 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 ppb. On December 3, 2015, the EPA published the proposed CSAPR Updating Rule to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The proposal establishes more stringent annual ozone season (May 1 through September 30) caps beginning May 1, 2017. We do not anticipate any material impact on our earnings or financial condition due to the CSAPR.•Ozone Standard—In December 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to lower the ambient air quality standard for the level of ozone in the atmosphere from 75 ppb to a level in the range of 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a standard of 70 ppb. To meet the new standard, the EPA and the states have to implement additional emission reduction strategies for NO and volatile organic compounds. Some portions of the Mid-Atlantic and New England states are not expected to be able to meet the new standard. Although the majority of our fossil generating units employ state-of-the-art NO emission controls, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter since new requirements of the EPA and the states are unknown at this time. Numerous parties have filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the rule.24table of contentsClimate Change•CO2 Regulation under the CAA—On October 23, 2015, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants. The NSPS establishes two emission standards for CO2 for the following categories: (i) fossil fuel-fired utility boilers and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) units, and (ii) natural gas combustion turbines. Simple cycle combustion turbines are exempt from the rule.On October 23, 2015, the EPA published the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulation under the CAA for existing power plants. The regulation establishes state-specific emission rate targets based on implementation of the best system of emission reduction (BSER). The BSER consists of three components: (i) heat rate improvements at existing coal-fired power plants, (ii) increased use of existing natural gas combined cycle capacity, and (iii) operation of incremental zero-emitting generation (renewables and nuclear). States may choose these or other methodologies to achieve the necessary reductions of CO2 emissions. Each state must submit a compliance plan to the EPA by September 6, 2016 or seek a two-year extension to September 6, 2018. States can comply using an emission rate-based plan (pounds CO2/MWh) or a mass-based plan (tons). Compliance with the final rule is effective January 1, 2022.The EPA, FERC and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that they plan to meet at least quarterly to evaluate states' plans and identify reliability concerns so adjustments can be made before the final plans are submitted. The agencies are engaging various stakeholders, including the Regional Transmission Operators/Independent System Operators. The agencies will continue to meet after the states' plans are in effect to assess if revisions are required.On October 23, 2015, the EPA also published proposed federal implementation requirements for states that do not submit an EPA-approved compliance plan. Comments were due by January 21, 2016. Numerous states, including New Jersey, and several industry groups filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the CPP. In addition, the petitioners sought a stay of the rule. On January 21, 2016, the D.C. Court declined to stay the CPP. However, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule pending further review of the case. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to stay the implementation of the CPP will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. If the CPP is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted.•Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—In response to concerns over global climate change, some states have developed initiatives to stimulate national climate legislation through CO2 emission reductions in the electric power industry. Certain northeastern states (RGGI States), including New York and Connecticut where we have generation facilities, have state-specific rules in place to enable the RGGI regulatory mandate in each state to cap and reduce CO2 emissions. These rules make allowances available through a regional auction whereby generators may acquire allowances that are each equal to one ton of CO2 emissions. Generators are required to submit an allowance for each ton emitted over a three-year period. Allowances are available through the auction or through secondary markets.In February 2013, the RGGI States released an updated Model Rule that, among other things, reduced the amount of available regional CO2 allowances beginning in 2014. Each RGGI State must implement the changes through state-specific regulations. We do not expect these changes, or any future changes, to the RGGI rules will have a material impact on us.  On November 17, 2015 the RGGI States initiated a 2016 Program Review stakeholder process. The focus of the 2016 Program Review is the post-2020 caps on GHG emissions and the incorporation of the EPA's CPP requirements.   New Jersey withdrew from RGGI beginning in 2012. As a result, our New Jersey facilities are no longer obligated to acquire CO2 emission allowances. This action has been challenged by environmental groups in the New Jersey state court. In March 2014, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) improperly withdrew its regulation under which RGGI had been implemented. The Court gave the NJDEP 60 days to initiate a public process to either repeal or amend that regulation to provide that it is applicable only when New Jersey is a participant in a regional or other established greenhouse gas program. On August 3, 2015, the NJDEP published its formal repeal of the rules implementing RGGI in New Jersey.   New Jersey also adopted the Global Warming Response Act in 2007, which calls for stabilizing its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, followed by a further reduction of greenhouse emissions to 80% below 2006 levels by 2050. To reach this goal, the NJDEP, the BPU, other state agencies and stakeholders are required to evaluate methods to meet and exceed the emission reduction targets, taking into account their economic benefits and costs.25table of contentsWater Pollution ControlThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to U.S. waters from point sources, except pursuant to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA or by a state under a federally authorized state program. The FWPCA authorizes the imposition of technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits to regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters. The EPA has delegated authority to a number of state agencies, including those in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, to administer the NPDES program through state action. We also have ownership interests in facilities in other jurisdictions that have their own laws and implement regulations to control discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly govern our facilities in those jurisdictions.•Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines—On September 30, 2015, the EPA issued a new Effluent Guidelines Limitation Rule for steam electric generating units. The rule establishes new best available technology economically achievable (BAT) standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization and flue gas mercury control wastewater. The EPA provides an implementation period for currently existing discharges of three years or up to eight years if a facility needs more time to implement equipment upgrades and provide supporting information to its permitting authority. In the intervening time period, existing discharge standards continue to apply. Power's Mercer and Bridgeport Harbor stations and the jointly-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, have bottom ash transport water discharges that are regulated under this rule. We are unable to predict if this rule will have a material impact on our future capital requirements, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition to regulating the discharge of pollutants, the FWPCA regulates the intake of surface waters for cooling. The use of cooling water is a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations. Section 316(b) of the FWPCA requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The impact of regulations under Section 316(b) can be significant, particularly at steam-electric generating stations which do not have closed cycle cooling and do not use cooling towers to recycle water for cooling purposes. The installation of cooling towers at an existing generating station can impose significant engineering challenges and significant costs, which can affect the economic viability of a particular plant.•Cooling Water Intake Structure Regulation—In May 2014, the EPA issued a final cooling water intake rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day.  The EPA has structured the rule so that each state Permitting Director will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. In connection with the assessment of the BTA of each facility that seeks a permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. In August 2014, the EPA established October 14, 2014 as the effective date for each state to implement the provisions of the rule going forward when considering the renewal of permits for existing facilities on a case by case basis.In September 2014, several environmental non-governmental groups and certain energy industry groups filed petitions for review of the rule and the case has been assigned to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Second Circuit). Environmental organizations, including but not limited to the environmental petitioners in the Second Circuit, have also filed suit under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) challenging the Biological Opinion issued by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on the 316(b) rule in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Parties to these cases filed motions seeking to consolidate this secondary action with the primary case residing with the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit has agreed to consolidate the case and to allow industry petitioners to amend their petition to include review of the Biological Opinion issued by the FWS and NMFS and to add both parties as Respondents. This means that the FWS and NMFS will be parties to the 316(b) litigation, and the ESA claims against them will not be proceeding in the U.S. District Court. Briefings before the court are scheduled to begin in 2016 but the schedule has not yet been established. We are assessing the potential impact of the rule on each of our affected facilities and are unable to predict the outcome of permitting decisions and the effect, if any, that they may have on our future capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations, although such impacts could be material. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information.  On June 30, 2015, the NJDEP issued a draft New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. The draft permit was subject to a public notice and comment period. We participated in the NJDEP’s August 5, 2015 public hearing and submitted comments on the draft permit on September 18, 2015. The NJDEP may make revisions before issuing the 26table of contentsfinal permit which is expected in the first half of 2016. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. We are actively engaged with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) regarding renewal of the current permit for the cooling water intake structure at Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 3 (BH3). To address compliance with the EPA’s CWA Section 316(b) final rule, the current proposal under consideration is that, if a final permit is issued, we would continue to operate BH3 without making the capital expenditures for modification to the existing intake structure and retire the BH3 within five years of the effective date of the final permit. Based on current discussions with the CTDEEP, if the proposal is accepted, a final permit could be issued in the summer of 2016 indicating a potential retirement date for BH3 by summer 2021, which is four years earlier than the current estimated useful life ending in 2025. If the permit is not issued and the conditions below are not met, we will seek to operate BH3 through the current estimated useful life.Separately, we have also negotiated a Community Environmental Benefit Agreement (CEBA) with the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. That CEBA provides that we would retire BH3 early if all its precedent conditions occur, which include receipt of all final permits to build and operate a proposed new combined cycle generating facility on the same site that BH3 currently operates, which could occur in 2017. Absent those conditions being met, and the permit renewal referred to above not being issued, we will seek to operate BH3 through the current estimated useful life. In February 2016, the proposed generating facility was awarded a capacity obligation. Construction is expected to commence in 2017, with operations expected to begin in mid-2019.  •Waters of the United States—In April 2014, the EPA Administrator and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) jointly published a proposed rule to clarify the definition of waters of the U.S. under the CWA programs in order to protect the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of the nation’s water resources. This definition will have broad application to all areas of compliance under the CWA, including permitted discharges and construction activities. The final rule was published on June 29, 2015 and we are reviewing it to determine the materiality of the impacts that might result from the final rule. Some states, including New Jersey, are subject to state requirements beyond those imposed under federal law. While we do not anticipate material impacts to projects in New Jersey, the new definition could impose requirements in other states and regions that could impact the development of renewables.  Various states, industry coalitions and environmental organizations have initiated legal action related to the provisions of the final rule. On October 9, 2015, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule pending further court action.       •Bridgeport Harbor National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Compliance—In April 2015, we determined that monitoring and reporting practices related to certain permitted wastewater discharges at our Bridgeport Harbor station may have violated conditions of the station's NPDES permit and applicable regulations and could subject us to fines and penalties. We have notified the CTDEEP of the issues and have taken actions to investigate and resolve the potential non-compliance. We cannot predict the impact of this matter.•Endangered Species Act—On June 16, 2015, the Sierra Club and another environmental group submitted to the NJDEP a sixty-day notice of intent to sue alleging the agency has caused violations of the Endangered Species Act by allowing our Mercer generation station to operate in a manner which has caused the mortality of certain species of sturgeon. Among other things, the notice requested the NJDEP to prioritize completion of a permit renewal action for Mercer which addresses the alleged Endangered Species Act violations. We cannot predict the outcome of this action. Hazardous Substance LiabilityThe production and delivery of electricity and the distribution and manufacture of gas, results in various by-products and substances classified by federal and state regulations as hazardous. These regulations may impose liability for damages to the environment from hazardous substances, including obligations to conduct environmental remediation of discharged hazardous substances as well as monetary payments, regardless of the absence of fault and the absence of any prohibitions against the activity when it occurred, as compensation for injuries to natural resources. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our historic operations and the operations of hundreds of other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex. The EPA is also evaluating the Hackensack River, a tributary to Newark Bay, for inclusion in the Superfund program. We no longer manufacture gas. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.•Site Remediation—The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) require the remediation of discharged hazardous substances and authorize the EPA, the NJDEP and private parties to commence lawsuits to compel clean-27table of contentsups or reimbursement for such remediation. The clean-ups can be more complicated and costly when the hazardous substances are in a body of water.•Natural Resource Damages—CERCLA and the Spill Act authorize the assessment of damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance, causing an injury to natural resources. Pursuant to the Spill Act, the NJDEP requires persons conducting remediation to characterize injuries to natural resources and to address those injuries through restoration or damages. The NJDEP adopted regulations concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation of contaminated sites. The NJDEP also issued guidance to assist parties in calculating their natural resource damage liability for settlement purposes, but has stated that those calculations are applicable only for those parties that volunteer to settle a claim for natural resource damages before a claim is asserted by the NJDEP. We are currently unable to assess the magnitude of the potential financial impact of this regulatory change, although such impacts could be material.Fuel and Waste Disposal•Nuclear Fuel Disposal—The federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel. To pay for this service, nuclear plant owners are required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund. In accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, in 2009 the DOE conducted its annual review of the adequacy of the Nuclear Waste Fee and concluded that the current fee of 1/10 cent per kWh was adequate to recover program costs. In 2011, we joined the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and fifteen other nuclear plant operators in a lawsuit in federal court seeking suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fee. In June 2012, the court ruled that the DOE failed to justify continued payments by electricity consumers into the Nuclear Waste Fund and ordered the DOE to conduct a complete reassessment of this fee. Spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations located at reactors or away from reactor sites. Since May 2014, the DOE reduced the nuclear waste fee to zero. Prior to the elimination of this fee, the annualized pre-tax cost was approximately $30 million.We have on-site storage facilities that are expected to satisfy the storage needs of Salem 1, Salem 2, Hope Creek, Peach Bottom 2 and Peach Bottom 3 through the end of their operating licenses. •Low Level Radioactive Waste—As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generation units produce low level radioactive waste. Such waste includes paper, plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials. These waste materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities. New Jersey, Connecticut and South Carolina have formed the Atlantic Compact, which gives New Jersey nuclear generators continued access to the Barnwell waste disposal facility which is owned by South Carolina. We believe that the Atlantic Compact will provide for adequate low level radioactive waste disposal for Salem and Hope Creek through the end of their current licenses including full decommissioning, although no assurances can be given. Low Level Radioactive Waste is periodically being shipped to the Barnwell site from Salem and Hope Creek. Additionally, there are on-site storage facilities for Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom, which we believe have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility.•Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs)—On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued a final rule which regulates CCRs as non-hazardous and requires that facility owners implement a series of actions to close or upgrade existing CCR surface impoundments and/or landfills. It also establishes new provisions for the construction of new surface impoundments and landfills. Our Hudson and Mercer generating stations, along with our co-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, are subject to the provisions of this rule. On April 17, 2015, the final rule was published with an effective date of October 19, 2015. The impact of this final rule was not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Item 8. Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information.

RISK FACTORSThe following factors should be considered when reviewing our business. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report.The factors discussed in Item 7. MD&A may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and affect the market prices for our publicly-traded securities. While we believe that we have identified and discussed the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant.We are exposed to commodity price volatility as a result of our participation in the wholesale energy markets.The material risks associated with the wholesale energy markets known or currently anticipated that could adversely affect our operations include:•Price fluctuations and collateral requirements—We expect to meet our supply obligations through a combination of generation and energy purchases. We also enter into derivative and other positions related to our generation assets and supply obligations. As a result, we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations that could affect our future results and impact our liquidity needs. These include:•variability in costs, such as changes in the expected price of energy and capacity that we sell into the market,•increases in the price of energy purchased to meet supply obligations or the amount of excess energy sold into the market,•variation in the relative prices of electricity and gas at the hubs within the markets, •the cost of fuel to generate electricity, and•the cost of emission credits and congestion credits that we use to transmit electricity.In the markets where we operate, natural gas prices have a major impact on the price that generators receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively weak or strong demand. Therefore, significant changes in the price of natural gas usually translate into significant changes in the wholesale price of electricity.Over the past few years, wholesale prices for natural gas have declined from the peak levels experienced in 2008. One reason for this decline is increased shale gas production as extraction technology has improved. Lower gas prices have resulted in lower electricity prices, which has reduced our margins as nuclear and coal generation costs have not declined similarly. Over that time, generation by our coal units was also adversely affected by the relatively lower price of natural gas as compared to coal, making it sometimes more economic to run certain of our gas units than our coal units.Natural gas prices may remain at low levels for an extended period and continue to decline if further advances in technology result in greater volumes of shale gas production. Consequently, our margin may continue to be reduced as a result of sustained lower electricity prices.Many factors may affect capacity pricing in PJM, including but not limited to:•changes in load and demand,•changes in the available amounts of demand response resources,•changes in available generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates, forced outage rates, etc.),•increases in transmission capability between zones, •changes to the pricing mechanism, including increasing the potential number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that PJM may propose over time,     •environmental regulation and legislation,•weather conditions,•electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions, and•development of new fuels and new technologies for the production of power.30table of contentsPotential changes to the rules governing energy markets in which the output of our plants is sold also poses risk to our business, as discussed further below. As market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, our forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require us to post substantial additional collateral, thus requiring us to obtain additional sources of liquidity during periods when our ability to do so may be limited. If Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating, it would be required under certain agreements to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows. If Power had lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2015, it may have had to provide approximately $864 million in additional collateral. •Our cost of coal and nuclear fuel may substantially increase—Our coal and nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provide a substantial portion of our fuel needs over the next several years. However, it will be necessary to enter into additional arrangements to acquire coal and nuclear fuel in the future. Although our fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against these market risks, future increases in our fuel costs cannot be predicted with certainty and could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. While our generation runs on diverse fuels, allowing for flexibility, the mix of fuels ultimately used can impact earnings. •Third party credit risk—We sell generation output and buy fuel through the execution of bilateral contracts. These contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us. Any failure to perform by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In the spot markets, we are exposed to the risks of the default mechanisms that exist in those markets, some of which attempt to spread the risk across all participants, which may not be an effective way of lessening the severity of the risk of the amounts at stake. The impact of economic conditions may also increase such risk.We are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies that affects, or may affect, our businesses.We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. Changes in regulation can cause significant delays in or materially affect business planning and transactions and can materially increase our costs. Regulation affects almost every aspect of our businesses, including business management, the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services, investment strategies, the financing of our operations and the payment of dividends, as well as our ability to:•Obtain fair and timely rate relief—PSE&G's retail rates are regulated by the BPU and its wholesale transmission rates are regulated by FERC. The retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a base rate case and remain in effect until a new base rate case is filed and concluded. As a result of our Energy Strong order, we are required to file our next base rate case proceeding no later than November 1, 2017. In addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of costs and earn returns on authorized investments. These clause mechanisms require periodic updates to be reviewed and approved by the BPU and are subject to prudency reviews. Our utility's transmission rates are recovered through a FERC-approved formula rate. The revenue requirements are reset each year through this formula. The formula rate is also subject to prudency review. In addition, transmission ROEs have recently become the target of certain state utility commissions, municipal utilities, consumer advocates and consumer groups seeking to lower customer rates. These agencies and groups have filed complaints at FERC asking FERC to reduce the base ROE of various transmission owners. They point to changes in the capital markets as justification for lowering the ROE of these companies. While we are not the subject of any of these complaints, they could set a precedent for FERC-regulated transmission owners, such as PSE&G. Inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs, including a return of or on our investments in rates, could have a material adverse impact on our business. •Obtain required regulatory approvals—The majority of our businesses operate under MBR authority granted by FERC, which has determined that our subsidiaries do not have unmitigated market power and that MBR rules have been satisfied. Failure to maintain MBR eligibility, or the effects of any severe mitigation measures that may be required if market power was evaluated differently in the future, could have a material adverse effect on us.We may also be required to obtain various other regulatory approvals to, among other things, buy or sell assets, engage in transactions between our public utility and our other subsidiaries, and, in some cases, enter into financing arrangements, issue securities and allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Failure to obtain these approvals on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.31table of contents•Comply with regulatory requirements—There are federal standards, including mandatory NERC and Critical Infrastructure Protection standards, in place to ensure the reliability of the U. S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system black-outs. We have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited by the NERC for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance with applicable NERC standards.Further, FERC requires compliance with all of its rules and orders, including rules concerning Standards of Conduct, market behavior and anti-manipulation rules, reporting, interlocking directorate rules and cross-subsidization. In connection with an ongoing investigation by the FERC Staff regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of Power's cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market and the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units, we may incur potential disgorgement and other penalties which span a wide range depending on the success of our legal arguments. If our legal arguments do not prevail in whole or in part with FERC or in a judicial challenge that we may choose to pursue, it is likely that Power would record additional losses and that such additional losses would be material to PSEG’s and Power’s results of operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.We are subject to the reporting and record-keeping requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the CFTC, and may in the future be subject to CFTC requirements regarding position limits for trading of certain commodities. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act compliance, we will need to be vigilant in monitoring and reporting our swap transactions. The BPU conducts periodic combined management/competitive service audits of New Jersey utilities related to affiliate standard requirements, competitive services, cross-subsidization, cost allocation and other issues. We may be adversely affected by changes in energy regulatory policies, including energy and capacity market design rules and developments affecting transmission.The energy industry continues to be regulated and the rules to which our businesses are subject are always at risk of being changed. Our business has been impacted by established rules that create locational capacity markets in each of PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO. Under these rules, generators located in constrained areas are paid more for their capacity so there is an incentive to locate in those areas where generation capacity is most needed. Because much of our generation is located in constrained areas in PJM and ISO-NE, the existence of these rules has had a positive impact on our revenues. PJM’s locational capacity market design rules and New England forward capacity market rules have been challenged in court and continue to evolve. Any changes to these rules may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2011, New Jersey enacted a law establishing a LCAPP which provided for the construction of subsidized base load or mid-merit electric power generation. The LCAPP legislation was invalidated on constitutional grounds by a federal court order issued in October 2013 and a subsequent challenge in the Third Circuit upheld that decision. That decision has now been filed with the U.S. Supreme Court for consideration on appeal. However, future state actions in New Jersey and elsewhere to subsidize the construction of new generation could have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market on both a short-term and long-term basis. We could also be impacted by a number of other events, including regulatory or legislative actions, including, among other things, direct and indirect subsidies, favoring non-competitive markets and/or technologies and energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. Further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate, including BGS auctions, are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the New Jersey and federal regulatory and political arenas. We can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified.To the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, Power's capacity and energy revenues could be adversely affected. Moreover, through changes encouraged by FERC to transmission planning processes, or through RTO/ISO initiatives to change their planning processes, such as the recently accepted multi-driver project category in PJM, more transmission may ultimately be built to facilitate renewable generation or support other public policy initiatives. Any such addition to the transmission system could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.FERC has also eliminated the ROFR, which will have the effect of allowing third parties to build certain types of transmission projects in the service territories of incumbent utilities such as PSE&G. As a result, we could face competitive pressures for our transmission business in New Jersey, as well as in in other utilities’ service territories where we will be able to seek opportunities to build. Changes to FERC policies regarding transmission planning and rate treatment for transmission investment, including ROEs and incentive rates, could also have an impact on our transmission business. In addition, certain 32table of contentsPJM cost allocation determinations have been recently challenged at FERC, the resolution of which could impact costs borne by New Jersey ratepayers and increase customer bills.   We are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect our businesses, adversely impact our business plans or expose us to significant environmental fines and liabilities.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities regarding air quality, water quality, site remediation, land use, waste disposal, the impact on global climate, natural resources damages and other matters. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures. Changes in these laws, or violations of existing laws, could result in significant increases in our compliance costs, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, operating costs for remediation and clean-up actions, civil penalties or damages from actions brought by third parties for alleged health or property damages. Any such increase in our costs could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may also be unable to successfully recover certain of these cost increases through existing regulatory rate structures or our contracts with our customers.Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could:•prevent construction of new facilities,•limit or prevent continued operation of existing facilities,•limit or prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or•result in significant additional costs, each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In obtaining required approvals and maintaining compliance with laws and regulations, we focus on several key environmental issues, including:•Concerns over global climate change could result in laws and regulations to limit CO2 emissions or other GHG emissions produced by our fossil generation facilities—Federal and state legislation and regulation designed to address global climate change through the reduction of GHG emissions could materially impact our fossil generation facilities. For example, in 2015 the EPA published new rules for both new and existing power plants. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these regulations and to continue operation of our fossil generation facilities, which could include the potential need to purchase CO2 emission allowances. Such expenditures could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more such facilities. •CO2 Litigation—In addition to legislative and regulatory initiatives, the outcome of certain legal proceedings regarding alleged impacts of global climate change not involving us could be material to the future liability of energy companies. If relevant federal or state common law were to develop that imposed liability upon those that emit GHGs for alleged impacts of GHGs emissions, such potential liability to our fossil generation operations could be material. •Potential closed-cycle cooling requirements—The EPA issued a proposed rule in 2011 regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures. Following the receipt of extensive comments on its proposed rule, the EPA finalized this rule on May 19, 2014 with an effective date of October 14, 2014. The EPA did not mandate closed cycle cooling as the BTA. Instead, the EPA set a fish impingement mortality standard that relies on a technology-based approach. Under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. The rule also requires that entrainment BTA decisions rely on site-specific analysis that includes an assessment of social costs-social benefits.The EPA has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. In connection with the assessment of the BTA of each facility that seeks permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. State actions to renew permits under the provisions of this rule are ongoing at this time. If the NJDEP or the CTEEP were to require installation of closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent at any of our Salem, Mercer, Hudson, Bridgeport, Sewaren or New Haven generating stations, the related increased costs and impacts would be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and would require further economic review to determine whether to continue operations or decommission any such station.•Remediation of environmental contamination at current or formerly-owned facilities—We are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. Remediation activities 33table of contentsassociated with our former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) operations are one source of such costs. In addition, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. The EPA is also evaluating the Hackensack River, a tributary to Newark Bay, for inclusion in the Superfund program. We are also involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, the related costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. New Jersey law places affirmative obligations on us to investigate and, if necessary, remediate contaminated property upon which we were in any way responsible for a discharge of hazardous substances, impacting the speed by which we will need to investigate contaminated properties, which could adversely impact cash flow. We cannot predict what further actions, if any, or the costs or the timing thereof, that may be required with respect to these or other natural resource damages claims. However, exposure to natural resource damages could subject us to additional potentially material liability. For a discussion of these and other environmental matters, see Item 8. Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Our ownership and operation of nuclear power plants involve regulatory, financial, environmental, health and safety risks.More than half of our total generation output each year is provided by our nuclear fleet, which comprises approximately one-third of our total owned generation capacity. For this reason, we are exposed to risks related to the continued successful operation of our nuclear facilities and issues that may adversely affect the nuclear generation industry. These include:•Storage and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel—We currently use on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel. Disposal of nuclear materials, including the availability or unavailability of a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel, could impact future operations of these stations. In addition, the availability of an off-site repository for spent nuclear fuel may affect our ability to fully decommission our nuclear units in the future.•Regulatory and Legal Risk—The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, or shut down a nuclear facility and impose substantial civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms and conditions of the licenses for nuclear generating facilities. As with all of our generation facilities, as discussed above, our nuclear facilities are also subject to comprehensive, evolving environmental regulation. Our nuclear generating facilities are currently operating under NRC licenses that expire in 2033 through 2046.•Operational Risk—Operations at any of our nuclear generating units could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. Since our nuclear fleet provides approximately half of our generation output, any significant outage could result in reduced earnings as we would need to purchase or generate higher-priced energy to meet our contractual obligations.•Nuclear Incident or Accident Risk—Accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations, both in the United States and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and may include loss of life, significant property damage and/or a change in the regulatory climate. We have nuclear units at two sites. It is possible that an accident or other incident at a nuclear generating unit could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate unaffected units located at the same site, which would further affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. An accident or incident at a nuclear unit not owned by us could also affect our ability to continue to operate our units. Any resulting financial impact from a nuclear accident may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages. Further, as a licensed nuclear operator subject to the Price-Anderson Act and a member of a nuclear industry mutual insurance company, Power is subject to potential retroactive assessments as a result of a nuclear incident or retroactive adverse loss experience. In the event of non-compliance with applicable legislation, regulation and licenses, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending on its assessment of the severity of the non-compliance. If a serious nuclear incident were to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In each case, the amount and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the operation of our nuclear fleet are limited and may be insufficient to cover any costs we may incur. Our inability to balance energy obligations with available supply could negatively impact results.The revenues provided by the operation of our generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. Generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements or other bilateral contracts or be sold into competitive power markets. Participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments. Generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, 34table of contentscapacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served. A decrease in prevailing market prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our generation business frequently involves the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. To the extent that we have produced or purchased energy in excess of our contracted obligations, a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability. Conversely, to the extent that we have contracted obligations in excess of energy we have produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability. If the strategy we utilize to hedge our exposure to these various risks is not effective, we could incur significant losses. Our market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances, customer migration and pricing differentials at various geographic locations. These risks cannot be predicted with certainty.Increases in market prices also affect our ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices.Inability to successfully develop or construct generation, transmission and distribution projects within budget could adversely impact our businesses. Our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of required environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities and modernizing existing infrastructure. Currently, we have several significant projects underway or being contemplated.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, complete these projects within budgets, on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and, in our regulated businesses, our ability to recover the related costs through rates. Any delays, cost escalations or otherwise unsuccessful construction and development could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Any inability to recover the carrying amount of our assets could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In accordance with accounting guidance, management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices, could potentially indicate an asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant reductions in our expected revenues or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Inability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.Capital for projects and investments has been provided primarily by internally-generated cash flow and external financings. We have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the construction and other cash flow needs of our businesses. The ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital depend on numerous factors including, among other things, general economic and market conditions, the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence, the success of current projects and the quality of new projects.The ability to have continued access to the credit and capital markets at a reasonable economic cost is dependent upon our current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and the availability of capital under reasonable terms and conditions. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining re-financing for maturing debt or financing for projects and investments on acceptable terms or at all.We face significant competition in the merchant energy markets.Our wholesale power and marketing businesses are subject to significant competition that may adversely affect our ability to make investments or sales on favorable terms and achieve our annual objectives. Increased competition could contribute to a reduction in prices offered for power and could result in lower earnings. Decreased competition could negatively impact results through a decline in market liquidity. Some of our competitors include:•merchant generators,•domestic and multi-national utility rate-based generators,•energy marketers,35table of contents•utilities,•banks, funds and other financial entities,•fuel supply companies, •affiliates of other industrial companies, and•distributed generation.Regulatory, environmental, industry and other operational developments will have a significant impact on our ability to compete in energy markets, potentially resulting in erosion of our market share and impairment in the value of our power plants. Changes in customer usage patterns and technology could adversely impact us.•DSM and other efficiency efforts—DSM and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of consumers’ usage could result in a reduction in load requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.•Changes in technology and/or customer behaviors—It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, including distributed generation, such as fuel cells, micro turbines, micro grids, windmills and net-metered solar installations, to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. Large customers, such as universities and hospitals, continue to explore potential micro grid installation. Substantial micro grid penetration can impact energy costs, system performance and demand growth. It is also possible that electric customers may significantly decrease their electric consumption due to demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology and usage, such as municipal aggregation, could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect our financial results. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production, increase reliance by customers on on-site generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors could result in decreased reliance on our system, each of which could adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position and investment opportunities.Financial market performance directly affects the asset values of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and defined benefit plan trust funds. Sustained decreases in asset value of trust assets could result in the need for significant additional funding.The performance of the financial markets will affect the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy our future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans and to decommission our nuclear generating plants. A decline in the market value of our pension assets could result in the need for us to make significant contributions in the future to maintain our funding at sufficient levels.We may be adversely affected by equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events or other incidents that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses.The success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. We are also exposed to the risk of equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events, or other incidents which could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property. For instance, equipment failures in our natural gas distribution could give rise to a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses and harm our reputation. PSE&G operates and maintains more than 17,700 miles of distribution mains that transport gas to 1.8 million customers. PSE&G also operates and maintains the largest cast iron infrastructure in any one state in the country at approximately 4,000 miles.  In addition, the physical risks of severe weather events, such as experienced from Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy, and of climate change, changes in sea level, temperature and precipitation patterns and other related phenomena have further exacerbated these risks. Such issues experienced at our facilities, or by others in our industry, could adversely impact our revenues, increase costs to repair and maintain our systems, subject us to potential litigation and/or damage claims, fines/penalties, and increase the level of oversight of our utility and generation operations and infrastructure through investigations or through the imposition of additional regulatory or legislative requirements. Such actions could adversely affect our costs, competitiveness and future investments, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 36table of contentsActs of war or terrorism could adversely affect our operations.Our businesses and industry may be impacted by acts and threats of war or terrorism. These actions could result in increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in fuel prices which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our infrastructure facilities, such as our generating stations, transmission and distribution facilities, could be direct or indirect targets or be affected by terrorist or other criminal activity. Such events could severely disrupt our business operations and prevent us from servicing our customers. In addition, new or updated security regulations may require us to make changes to our current measures which could also result in additional expenses.   Cybersecurity attacks or intrusions could adversely impact our businesses.We own and/or operate generating stations and transmission and distribution facilities, all of which are dependent on the operation of our information technology systems. Our ability to market our generation output and acquire and hedge fuel and power are also dependent on our information technology systems. Our information technology systems may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, hostile technological intrusions or inadvertent disclosure of company and/or customer information or a cybersecurity attack may leverage our information technology to cause disruptions at another company. Cybersecurity threats to our operations include:•Disruption of the operation of our assets and the power grid,•Theft of confidential company, employee, shareholder, vendor or customer information, •General business system and process interruption or compromise, including preventing us from servicing our customers, collecting revenues or the ability to record, process and/or report financial information correctly, and•Breaches of vendors' infrastructures where our confidential information is stored.If a significant cybersecurity event or breach should occur, it could result in material costs for repair and remediation, breach notification, operations and increased capital costs. Such a cybersecurity incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws, regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings, regulatory fines and increased scrutiny and possible damage to our reputation and brand, resulting in a reduction in customer confidence. We devote resources to network and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computing systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse and interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. However, given the ever changing nature of cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance the security measures we have taken and will take in the future can protect us against all possible occurrences.We may be unable to achieve, or continue to sustain, our expected levels of operating performance.One of the key elements to achieving the results in our business plan is the ability to sustain generating operating performance and capacity factors at expected levels since our forward sales of energy and capacity assume acceptable levels of operating performance. This is especially important at our lower-cost facilities. Operations at any of our plants could degrade to the point where the plant has to shut down or operate at less than full capacity. Some issues that could impact the operation of our facilities are:•breakdown or failure of equipment, information technology, processes or management effectiveness,•disruptions in the transmission of electricity,•labor disputes,•fuel supply interruptions,•transportation constraints,•limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements, and, •operator error or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms, acts of terrorism or other similar occurrences.Identifying and correcting any of these issues may require significant time and expense. Depending on the materiality of the issue, we may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning it to full capacity. In either event, to the extent that our operational targets are not met, we could have to operate higher-cost generation facilities or meet our obligations through higher-cost open market purchases. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.                                                                                             37table of contentsAn extended economic recession would likely have a material adverse effect on our businesses.Our results of operations may be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy, including low levels in the market prices of commodities. Adverse conditions in the economy affect the markets in which we operate and can negatively impact our results. Declines in demand for energy will reduce overall sales and cash flows, especially as customers reduce their consumption of electricity and gas. Although our utility business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return, overall declines in electricity and gas sold and/or increases in non-payment of customer bills would materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to realize anticipated tax benefits or retain existing tax credits.The deferred tax assets and tax credits of PSEG, PSE&G or Power are evaluated for ultimate realizability. While presently not the case, a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets if we estimate that such assets are more likely than not to be unrealizable. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets or the monetization of tax credits can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future or the benefit of tax credits, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Because PSEG is a holding company, its ability to meet its corporate funding needs, service debt and pay dividends could be limited. PSEG is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock or membership interests of its subsidiaries and project affiliates. Accordingly, all of the operations of PSEG are conducted by its subsidiaries and project affiliates which are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts when due on the debt of, or to make any funds available to PSEG to pay such amounts and satisfy its other corporate funding needs. These corporate funding needs include PSEG's operating expenses, the payment of interest on and principal of its outstanding indebtedness and the payment of dividends on its capital stock. As a result, PSEG can give no assurances that its subsidiaries and project affiliates will be able to transfer funds to PSEG to meet all of these obligations.                            Challenges associated with retention of a qualified workforce could adversely impact our businesses.Our operations depend on the retention of a skilled workforce. The loss or retirement of key executives or other employees, including those with the specialized knowledge required to support our generation, transmission and distribution operations, could result in various operational challenges. These challenges may include the lack of appropriate replacements, the loss of institutional and industry knowledge and the increased costs to hire and train new personnel. This has the potential to become more critical over the next several years as a growing number of employees become eligible to retire.In addition, because a significant portion of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, our success will depend on our ability to successfully renegotiate these agreements as they expire. Inability to do so may result in employee strikes or work stoppages which would disrupt our operations and could also result in increased costs.Our receipt of payment of receivables related to our domestic leveraged leases is dependent upon the credit quality and the ability of lessees to meet their obligations.Our receipt of payments of equity rent, debt service and other fees related to our leveraged lease portfolio in accordance with the lease contracts can be impacted by various factors. The factors which may impact future lease cash flow include, but are not limited to, new environmental legislation regarding air quality and other discharges in the process of generating electricity, market prices for fuel and electricity, including the impact of low gas prices on our coal generation investments, overall financial condition of lease counterparties and the quality and condition of assets under lease. If a lessee were to default, we could potentially be required to impair our current investment balances.  ITEM 1B
