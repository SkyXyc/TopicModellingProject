: “Risk Factors- Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business.”PayPal seeks to differentiate itself from industry participants on the safety of the transaction (our risk management capabilities as well as protection of consumer account details), the simplicity provided for digital transactions, and being both brand and technology agnostic. Further, unlike traditional four-party networks or other mobile payment solutions, PayPal has a direct financial relationship with both its consumers and merchants. As a result of our risk management capabilities, PayPal can provide its customers with protection from fraud and other losses incurred by participants to a transaction.To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. During 2015, PayPal incurred $947 million on product innovation and development and enhancing our infrastructure to ensure our customers have the capabilities they need and want to complete transactions safely and simply. Further, in 2015, we incurred over $900 million related to our efforts to promote our brands through advertising, promotions, and other strategic initiatives. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among consumers at checkout.Our strengthsOur business is built on a strong foundation designed to allow PayPal to differentiate itself from our competitors and drive growth. 6Table of ContentsOur competitive capabilities include: •Two-sided Platform - our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions (use of an email address, a mobile phone number, or our One Touch product) while being both brand and technology agnostic. •Risk Management - our risk management system and tokenization allows us to keep our customers safer and to process legitimate transactions around the world while preventing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions. •Brand -PayPal has built a well-recognized and trusted brand and was named one of Interbrand’s best global brands of 2015.•Scale - our global scale gives us impressive reach. As of December 31, 2015, we had 179 million active customer accounts which included 13 million merchants, and in 2015, PayPal processed $282 billion of total payment volume in more than 200 markets around the world.•Regulatory Capability - we believe that our regulatory licenses that give us the ability to operate in markets around the world are a clear advantage and help our business grow.•Financial Strength - the diversity of our funding mix gives us confidence we can continue to grow profitably. Our strong balance sheet, low debt and cash balance allow us to aggressively pursue new opportunities.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” in “: Risk Factors -Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Item 3: Legal Proceedings" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.SeasonalityThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality. No individual quarter in 2015, 2014 or 2013 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue.Research and DevelopmentTotal research and development expense was $947 million, $890 million and $727 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Financial Information About SegmentsSee “Note 10—Segment and Geographical Information” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information about segments.  Additionally, please see the information in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" under the caption "Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business," which describes risks associated with the foreign operations of segments.10Table of ContentsEmployeesAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 16,800 people globally, of whom approximately 9,800 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with employees to be good.Separation from eBay Inc.PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly-traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.  Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.Available InformationThe address of our principal executive offices is PayPal Holdings, Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131 and our telephone number is (408) 967-1000.

RISK FACTORSThe following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections, as well as our combined and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us.Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial ConditionSubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business.The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against businesses in varied industries, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position in other industries, or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change, innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the competitive landscape. We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards (these providers include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) initiative supported by major U.S. retailers, Apple, Google, and others);•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (e.g., Apple's mobile Apple Pay) or Host Card Emulation (HCE) functionality to eliminate the need for access to the physical secure element in the device (e.g., Google's Android solution);•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number, such as Facebook messaging payments, Google and many banks;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network, such as Wal-Mart;•money remitters, such as MoneyGram, Western Union, Global Payments, Inc. and Euronet; and•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit in the United States and abroad;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other international online payment-services providers;•other providers of online account-based payments;•payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer’s mobile phone account;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account;•online shopping services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; and•services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies.12Table of Contents    Some of these payment providers have greater customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth. We also expect new entrants, as well as established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments, to offer competitive products and services in the future. In addition, some merchants provide such services for themselves. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. In certain countries, such as Germany, Netherlands and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions with which our products compete. We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•security of transactions and the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business.Our operating and financial results come primarily from transactions involving payments made in a reporting period and are therefore subject to fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock.Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have a backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph.Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted regional and global financial markets in the past and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future. These events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact on the companies and customers with which we do business. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our payments platforms.13Table of ContentsIf we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments, particularly developments with respect to mobile payments, to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could decline.Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, ecommerce (e.g., social commerce), mobile, virtual currencies and near field communication and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments.  We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge, which may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, or third-party intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed.For example, mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions and payments, and a significant and growing portion of our customers access our Payments Platform through mobile devices. We may lose customers if we are not able to continue to meet our customers’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment. In addition, a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile markets. Our ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success, and any failure to continue to increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our Payments Platform could harm our business.Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business.We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a PayPal account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Some of our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers. Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large on-line and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. For example, in May 2014, eBay Inc. publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted user passwords and other non-financial user data, from certain of eBay's Marketplaces business unit databases, which led to eBay Marketplaces requiring a password reset and fewer eBay Marketplaces transactions using our PayPal services.     The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers, or attempting to fraudulently 14Table of Contentsinduce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.  As a result of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks.   Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security, Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations; result in our systems or services being unavailable; result in improper disclosure of data; materially harm our reputation and brand; result in significant legal and financial exposure; lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services; and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any breaches of network or data security at our partners or customers could have similar effects. In addition, our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to PayPal.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business.  Additionally, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business.Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has suffered significant intermittent unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the full-time availability of our PayPal products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital and mobile payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose 15Table of Contentsexisting licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including eBay, and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business.We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa’s or MasterCard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services. Any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers, and may subject us to pricing pressure, although it would also lower our costs. Future changes to those regulations could potentially adversely affect our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would materially harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption.    Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.    We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. We also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could 16Table of Contentspotentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. Our PayPal Credit products are similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day.  We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results.Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.Cross-border trade  (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits.  Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations.     Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight.  For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, please see Item I - “Business—Government Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.  The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us , as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. 17Table of ContentsAny failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements.  The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brand and business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.  We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.Payments RegulationIn the United States, PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. This license includes not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Venmo branded products and services.  Our subsidiary, Xoom, is also licensed as a money transmitter in certain U.S. states. As licensed money transmitters, PayPal and Xoom are subject to restrictions with respect to their investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our consumers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the United States) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, approximately 30 markets are in member states of the European Union. We provide our services to customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, European Union laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the European Union, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In many of the other markets in which we do business, including Canada and a number of markets in Asia, Central America and South America, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses. Even if we were able to obtain such licenses, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance 18Table of Contentsor other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products in certain countries.In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local bank. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services in a given market, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any services in a given market.Consumer ProtectionWe are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  The financial services sector has been increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny.  In the U.S., we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, required to make additional disclosures to our consumers and to comply with new restrictions and requirements on our activities.  Among other things, our services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Under such regulations, among other things, we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer. Additionally, even technical violations of these laws can result in assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances, and we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts). In January 2012, the CFPB finalized rules under Regulation E, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which required us, beginning in October 2013, to provide additional disclosures, error resolution rights, and cancellation rights to U.S. consumers who make international remittance payments. In November 2014, the CFPB proposed a new prepaid account rule that would apply to prepaid cards, mobile wallets and potentially PayPal accounts. In December 2014, we became subject to CFPB supervision and examination pursuant to a new regulation that allows the CFPB to supervise all companies, including PayPal, that provide more than one million international remittance transfers per year. Under the regulation, CFPB examiners are now able to examine us for compliance with the remittance transfer rule and other laws and regulations. These and other rules promulgated by the CFPB could increase our costs and require us to expend substantial resources and make changes to our business practices. In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order ("Consent Order") with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to the PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs associated with compliance or redress. PayPal (Europe) offers its services in European Union countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other European Union member states pursuant to European Union Directives, and has completed the “passport” notification process in all European Union member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans for expanding our business in European Union countries. In addition, the countries that are members of the European Union may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the European Union Payment Services Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The European Commission has proposed revisions to the Payments Services and Anti-Money Laundering Directives, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Finally, if the assets of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank ("ECB") determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de surveillance du secteur financier, as our national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.19Table of ContentsAnti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. We routinely report to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations.  In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our practices between 2009 and 2013. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that we have self-reported could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. Subsequent to our March 2015 settlement, we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business.  Violation of OFAC sanctions regulations that OFAC determines to be egregious can result in statutory penalties of up to $250,000 per transaction.  For a discussion of our dealings with OFAC, please see “Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Matters.”U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Privacy and Protection of User DataWe are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as "privacy laws") relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as "process") of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (sometimes called personal data) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal information that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. The European Court of Justice in the Schrems case has ruled that the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the European Union to the United States, could no longer be relied upon. The potential impact of this ruling is subject to further determination and additional developments, including the potential development of a new form of Safe Harbor framework or a requirement to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework for the transfer of E.U. personal data to the United States.  Rather, when our company was a subsidiary of eBay Inc., we relied on binding corporate rules that permitted such transfers; upon separation from eBay, we have continued to operate under these same binding corporate rules pending the approval of our application for our own independent binding corporate rules.  While PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework, some of our data processing subsidiaries, service providers, customers or other business partners do. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the E.U. However, a recent European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the E.U. potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various E.U. member states in which we have established legal entities. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of laws of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. 20Table of ContentsIn addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been and may be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices including concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the United States and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business.As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state, we rely on a third party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States, and a different chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Working Capital product in the United States.  Both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of Utah.  In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States to lend under the PayPal Credit consumer product, our chartered financial institution that issues the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership of (and originate loans with respect to) all consumer accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In the event of either bank’s inability to lend, we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide.Our credit products expose us to additional risks.Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited product history, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes (e.g., bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations), competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors. Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit consumer account holders will default on their payment obligation, making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, and high unemployment 21Table of Contentsrates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.    We purchase receivables related to PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed.Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.”We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. The assets underlying our customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, corporate debt securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions in which we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest at a floating rate.Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate.    Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly-traded company on July 17, 2015 through the distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of PayPal to eBay’s stockholders, which we refer to as the distribution, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business.Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.Our international operations, especially in European Union countries (in particular, United Kingdom and Germany) and China, have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;22Table of Contents•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws; •compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities; •antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes, which may impose conflicting requirements on us;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•local licensing and reporting obligations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business.Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business.Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing illegal goods, creating liability to us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business.Our failure to manage the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business.Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could harm our business.We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States, individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the 23Table of ContentsUnited States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices.We are subject to patent litigation.We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.We believe the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available, and contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. We must protect our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming.  We may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment related services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.24Table of ContentsWe are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government and regulatory investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property,  and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and regulations. The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to management’s judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation.We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our tax structure. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated (or by the incurrence of losses) in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.In light of continuing global fiscal challenges, various levels of government and international organizations such as the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. These tax reform efforts are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions to increase tax revenue could increase our effective tax rate.We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.One or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax 25Table of Contentscompliance (and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several additional states and is in the process of being implemented by a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if one of our companies was deemed to be the legal agent of our merchants by a jurisdiction in which it operates. We have modified our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our customer experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business.Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.We have acquired a significant number of businesses, technologies, services, and products. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;•diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;•the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, compliance, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standards;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight associated with new lines of business;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•lawsuits resulting from the acquisition;•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.We may make certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and operational control. Under such circumstances, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling investor, joint venture partner or joint venture company may result in reputational harm or adversely affect the value of our investment.26Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our service, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our customers could harm our business.A number of third parties provide services to us or to our customers. As discussed in this Risk Factors section under the caption “Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business,” we are dependent on banks and other payment processors that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions. We rely on unaffiliated third party lenders to make the consumer and other loans originated through the PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products.  We also rely heavily on third parties to operate our services, including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions and third parties that provide loan receivable tracking and customer statements processing. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. We have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our customers and clients could also make it more difficult for our merchants to complete transactions, thereby harming our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint.  In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks.We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business.Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks.We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters;  given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;27Table of Contents•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed.Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business.Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including engineering and product development personnel, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business.Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded CompanyWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation.We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation of PayPal from eBay Inc., which we refer to as the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation and distribution were expected to provide the following benefits, among others: enhanced strategic and management focus; better ability to form strategic relationships; faster decision-making; more efficient allocation of capital; alignment of incentives with performance objectives; direct access to the capital markets; and a distinct investment identity. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business could be harmed.     If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay,PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and PayPal, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and PayPal. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or PayPal breach any of their respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction will be tax-free.28Table of ContentsIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities.We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders might consider desirable or may present us from engaging in certain capital-raising transactions.We have no history of operating as an independent, publicly traded company in our current form, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.The combined and consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:•Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing, human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these functions to maintain appropriate levels of administrative, legal and regulatory compliance.  •Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into arm’s length agreements with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.•As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions, investments and credit, and data from eBay that helps us to manage risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay enabled us to leverage eBay’s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.•Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.•The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay’s cost of capital prior to the separation.Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from eBay. For additional information, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.29Table of ContentseBay remains a significant source of our revenues after the distribution.After the distribution, we continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from eBay. If the operating agreement expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment options, our business could be materially harmed.eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements, transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements, including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected.After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at eBay.Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if PayPal and eBay were to have disagreements about the agreements between them or face decisions that could have different implications for PayPal and eBay.Risks Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the change in our stockholder base following the distribution;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.30Table of ContentsPayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by PayPal’s stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers.PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of PayPal, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of PayPal to PayPal or PayPal’s stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") or PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of PayPal’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with PayPal or PayPal’s directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, PayPal could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect PayPal’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Certain provisions in PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of PayPal, which could decrease the trading price of PayPal common stock.PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with PayPal’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of PayPal’s outstanding common stock;•the right of PayPal’s board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the ability of PayPal’s directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on PayPal’s board of directors in most circumstances.    PayPal has also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may favor.Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C. Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make PayPal immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that PayPal’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of PayPal and PayPal’s stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of PayPal’s stock (including preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, PayPal would be required to indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may consider favorable. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” and “Description of PayPal’s Capital Stock” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions.31Table of ContentsITEM 1B
