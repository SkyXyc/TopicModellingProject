Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    In the case of statements about our investment banking
    transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk
    that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that
    they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,
    if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may
    differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
    Important factors that could result in a modification of the
    terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed
    include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or
    continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of
    hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or
    an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
    securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,
    a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain
    adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a
    party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required
    regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors
    that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions,
    see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.

    Investment
    Banking


 


    Investment Banking represented 11% of 2009 net revenues. We
    provide a broad range of investment banking services to a
    diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,
    investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to
    develop and maintain
    long-term
    relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.


 


    Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry
    and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment
    bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually
    assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our
    clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to
    teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated
    fashion for the benefit of our clients.


 


    Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire
    resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment
    banking serving as “front of the house.” To accomplish
    this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and
    debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and
    liability management activities. This coordination is intended
    to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset
    and liability exposures and their capital.


 


    Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:
    Financial Advisory and Underwriting.


 



    Financial
    Advisory


 


    Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to
    mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense
    activities, restructurings and
    spin-offs.
    Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our
    significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions
    for which we provide multiple services, including
    “one-stop”
    acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as
    well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest
    rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number
    of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that
    we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.


 



    Underwriting


 


    Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of
    a wide range of securities and other financial instruments,
    including common and preferred stock, convertible and
    exchangeable securities,
    investment-grade
    debt,
    high-yield
    debt, sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank
    loans,
    asset-backed
    securities and real estate-related securities, such as
    mortgage-related
    securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.


 


    Equity Underwriting.  Equity underwriting has
    been a
    long-term
    core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and
    acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning
    mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our
    leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide
    public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex
    transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.


 


    Debt Underwriting.  We engage in the
    underwriting and origination of various types of debt
    instruments, including
    investment-grade
    debt securities,
    high-yield
    debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging market debt
    securities, which may be issued by, among others, corporate,
    sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and
    originate structured securities, which include
    mortgage-related
    securities and other
    asset-backed
    securities and collateralized debt obligations.

    Trading and
    Principal Investments


 


    Trading and Principal Investments represented 76% of 2009 net
    revenues. Trading and Principal Investments facilitates client
    transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial
    institutions, investment funds, governments and individuals
    through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed
    income and equity products, currencies, commodities and
    derivatives on these products. We also take proprietary
    positions on certain of these products. In addition, we engage
    in
    market-making
    activities on equities and options exchanges, and we clear
    client transactions on major stock, options and futures
    exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and
    other investing activities, we make principal investments
    directly and through funds that we raise and manage.


 


    To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal
    Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We
    believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate
    client transactions distinguishes us from many of our
    competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.


 


    Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into
    three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities;
    Equities; and Principal Investments.


 



    Fixed Income,
    Currency and Commodities and Equities


 


    Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are
    large and diversified operations through which we assist clients
    with their investing and trading strategies and also engage in
    proprietary trading and investing activities.


 


    In our client-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to
    deliver
    high-quality
    service by offering broad
    market-making
    and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In
    addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by
    committing capital and taking risk, to facilitate client
    transactions and to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make
    markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed
    income, currency, commodity and equity products and their
    derivatives is crucial to our client relationships and to
    support our underwriting business by providing secondary market
    liquidity.


 


    We generate trading net revenues from our client-driven
    businesses in three ways:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high
    volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.




 



     
        • 

    
    Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital
    position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where
    spreads and fees are generally larger.




 



     
        • 

    
    Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address
    complex client needs.





 


    Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination
    to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and
    expertise.


 


    In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we
    assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify,
    analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our
    analytical models to analyze information and make informed
    trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived
    disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and
    from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.


 



    FICC


 


    We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products,
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed
    instruments, currencies and commodities, structure and enter
    into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in
    proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five principal
    businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies; interest
    rate products, including money market instruments; and
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed
    instruments.

Table of Contents





    Commodities.  We make markets in and trade a
    wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests
    in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products,
    metals, natural gas and electricity, coal and agricultural
    products. As part of our commodities business, we acquire and
    dispose of interests in, and engage in the development and
    operation of, electric power generation facilities and related
    activities.


 


    Credit Products.  We make markets in and trade
    a broad array of credit and
    credit-linked
    products all over the world, including credit derivatives,
    investment-grade
    corporate securities,
    high-yield
    securities, bank and secured loans (origination and trading),
    municipal securities, and emerging market and distressed debt.
    For example, we enter, as principal, into complex structured
    transactions designed to meet client needs.


 


    In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan
    facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are
    extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended
    to be
    short-term
    in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other
    funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit origination
    activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on commitments
    by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to
    other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing the positions
    through investment vehicles sold to other investors.
    Underwriting fees from syndications of these commitments are
    recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment Banking segment.
    However, to the extent that we recognize losses on these
    commitments, such losses are recorded within our Trading and
    Principal Investments segment, net of any related underwriting
    fees. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements
    in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for additional information on our commitments.


 


    Our credit products business includes making significant
    long-term
    and
    short-term
    investments for our own account (sometimes investing together
    with our merchant banking funds) in a broad array of asset
    classes (including distressed debt) globally. We
    opportunistically invest in debt and equity securities and
    secured loans, and in private equity, real estate and other
    assets.


 


    Currencies.  We act as a dealer in foreign
    exchange and trade in most currencies on exchanges and in cash
    and derivative markets globally.


 


    Interest Rate Products.  We make markets in and
    trade a variety of interest rate products, including interest
    rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and government bonds,
    as well as money market instruments, such as commercial paper,
    treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other highly liquid
    securities and instruments. This business includes our matched
    book, which consists of
    short-term
    collateralized financing transactions.


 


    Mortgage Business.  We make markets in and
    trade commercial and residential
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed
    and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in these
    products for trading purposes as well as for securitization or
    syndication. We also originate and service commercial and
    residential mortgages.


 



    Equities


 


    We make markets in and trade equities and
    equity-related
    products, structure and enter into equity derivative
    transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate
    commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on
    major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our
    Equities client franchise and clearing activities.


 


    Equities includes two principal businesses: our client franchise
    business and principal strategies. We also engage in
    exchange-based
    market-making
    activities and in insurance activities.

Table of Contents





    Client Franchise Business.  Our client
    franchise business includes primarily client-driven activities
    in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities
    markets. These activities also include clearing client
    transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges
    worldwide, as well as our exchange-based options
    market-making
    business. Our client franchise business increasingly involves
    providing our clients with access to electronic
    “low-touch”
    equity trading platforms, and electronic trades account for the
    majority of our client trading activity in this business.
    However, a majority of our net revenues in this business
    continues to be derived from our traditional
    “high-touch”
    handling of more complex trades. We expect both types of trading
    activities to remain important components of our client
    franchise business.


 


    We trade equity securities and
    equity-related
    products, including convertible securities, options, futures and
    over-the-counter
    (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis as an agent, as
    a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a principal, we
    facilitate client transactions, often by committing capital and
    taking risk, to provide liquidity to clients with large blocks
    of stocks or options. For example, we are active in the
    execution of large block trades. We also execute transactions as
    agent and offer clients direct electronic access to trading
    markets.


 


    Our derivatives business structures and executes derivatives on
    indices, industry groups, financial measures and individual
    company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information
    with respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset
    allocation transactions. We also work with our clients to create
    specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors
    to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or liquidate
    investment positions. We are one of the leading participants in
    the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. In
    listed options, we are registered as a primary or lead market
    maker or otherwise make markets on the International Securities
    Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the
    Boston Options Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and
    NYSE Alternext US. In futures and options on futures, we are
    market makers on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
    Board of Trade.


 


    Principal Strategies.  Our principal strategies
    business is a multi-strategy investment business that invests
    and trades our capital across global public markets. Investment
    strategies include fundamental equities and relative value
    trading (which involves trading strategies designed to take
    advantage of perceived discrepancies in the relative value of
    financial instruments, including equity,
    equity-related
    and debt instruments), event-driven investments (which focus on
    event-oriented special situations such as corporate
    restructurings, bankruptcies, recapitalizations, mergers and
    acquisitions, and legal and regulatory events), convertible bond
    trading and various types of volatility trading.


 


    Exchange-Based
    Market-Making
    Activities.  Our exchange-based
    market-making
    business consists of our stock and
    exchange-traded
    funds (ETF)
    market-making
    activities. In the United States, we are one of the leading
    Designated Market Makers for stocks traded on the NYSE. For
    ETFs, we are registered market makers on NYSE Arca.


 


    Insurance Activities.  We engage in a range of
    insurance and reinsurance businesses, including buying,
    originating
    and/or
    reinsuring fixed and variable annuity and life insurance
    contracts, reinsuring property catastrophe and residential
    homeowner risks and providing power interruption coverage to
    power generating facilities.


 



    Principal
    Investments


 


    Principal Investments primarily includes net revenues from three
    sources: returns on corporate and real estate investments;
    overrides on corporate and real estate investments made by
    merchant banking funds that we manage; and our investment in the
    ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
    Limited (ICBC).

Table of Contents





    Returns on Corporate and Real Estate
    Investments.  As of December 2009, the
    aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held
    directly or through our merchant banking funds, excluding our
    investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and our investment in
    the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
    Group, Inc. (SMFG), was $13.98 billion, comprised of
    corporate principal investments with an aggregate carrying value
    of $12.60 billion and real estate investments with an
    aggregate carrying value of $1.38 billion. In addition, as
    of December 2009, we had outstanding unfunded equity
    capital commitments of up to $12.27 billion, comprised of
    corporate principal investment commitments of $9.82 billion
    and real estate investment commitments of $2.45 billion.


 


    Overrides.  Consists of the increased share of
    the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds
    when the return on a fund’s investments over the life of
    the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred
    to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues

    ICBC.  Our investment in the ordinary shares of
    ICBC is valued using the quoted market price adjusted for
    transfer restrictions. Under the original transfer restrictions,
    the ICBC shares we held would have become free from transfer
    restrictions in equal installments on April 28, 2009
    and October 20, 2009. During the quarter ended
    March 2009, the shares became subject to new supplemental
    transfer restrictions. Under these new supplemental transfer
    restrictions, on April 28, 2009, 20% of the ICBC
    shares that we held became free from transfer restrictions and
    we completed the disposition of these shares during the second
    quarter of 2009. Our remaining ICBC shares are subject to
    transfer restrictions, which prohibit liquidation at any time
    prior to April 28, 2010. As of December 2009, the
    fair value of our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC was
    $8.11 billion, of which $5.13 billion is held by
    investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. For further
    information regarding our investment in the ordinary shares of
    ICBC, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value —
    Cash Instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Asset Management
    and Securities Services


 


    Asset Management and Securities Services represented 13% of 2009
    net revenues. Our asset management business provides investment
    and wealth advisory services and offers investment products
    (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled
    vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse group of
    institutions and individuals worldwide. Asset Management
    primarily generates revenues in the form of management and
    incentive fees. Securities Services provides prime brokerage
    services, financing services and securities lending services to
    institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds,
    pension funds and foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the
    form of interest rate spreads or fees.


 


    Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided
    into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.


 



    Asset
    Management


 


    Asset Management primarily consists of two related
    businesses — Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) and
    Private Wealth Management (PWM) — through which we
    offer a broad array of investment strategies and wealth advisory
    services to a diverse group of clients worldwide. In addition,
    Asset Management includes management fees related to our
    merchant banking activities.


 


    GSAM.  GSAM provides asset management services
    and offers investment products (primarily through separately
    managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds
    and private investment funds) across all major asset classes:
    money markets, fixed income, equities and alternative
    investments (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate,
    currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies). GSAM
    distributes investment products directly to the firm’s
    institutional clients, including pension funds, governmental
    organizations, corporations, insurance






    10








Table of Contents





    companies, banks, foundations and endowments, and indirectly to
    institutional and individual clients through
    third-party
    distribution channels, including brokerage firms, banks,
    insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. In
    addition, our Global Portfolio Solutions team offers clients
    investment and advisory services extending to risk management,
    portfolio implementation, reporting and monitoring.


 


    PWM.  PWM provides investment and wealth
    advisory services globally to
    high-net-worth
    individuals, family offices and selected institutions
    (principally foundations and endowments).


 


    Management of Merchant Banking Funds.  Goldman
    Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private
    investment funds. As of December 2009, the amount of Assets
    under management (AUM) in these funds (including both funded
    amounts and unfunded commitments on which we earn fees) was
    $93 billion.


 


    Our strategy with respect to these funds generally is to invest
    opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is
    diversified by industry, product type, geographic region, and
    transaction structure and type. Our corporate investment funds
    pursue, on a global basis,
    long-term
    investments in equity and debt securities in privately
    negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and
    investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real
    estate investment funds invest in real estate operating
    companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and
    other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant
    banking funds include funds that invest in infrastructure and
    infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.


 


    Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue
    streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a
    percentage of a fund’s committed capital, invested capital,
    total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual
    management fees are included in our Asset Management net
    revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in
    some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the
    funds’ unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from
    changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon
    realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return
    for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the
    fund’s income and gains that is a percentage of the income
    and gains from the fund’s investments. The second and third
    of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments
    within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.


 


    Assets under management.  AUM typically
    generates fees as a percentage of asset value, which is affected
    by investment performance and by inflows and redemptions. The
    fees that we charge vary by asset class, as do our related
    expenses. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to
    receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s
    return or when the return on assets under management exceeds
    specified benchmark returns or other performance targets.
    Incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends
    (in most cases, on December 31) and they are no longer
    subject to adjustment.


 


    AUM includes assets in our mutual funds, alternative investment
    funds and separately managed accounts for institutional and
    individual investors. Alternative investments include our
    merchant banking funds, which generate revenues as described
    above under
    “— Management
    of Merchant Banking Funds.” AUM includes assets in
    clients’ brokerage accounts to the extent that they
    generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather than
    commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.


 


    AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate
    commissions,
    mark-ups and
    spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments
    in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are
    included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM
    also does not include
    non-fee-paying
    assets, including interest-bearing deposits held through our
    bank depository institution subsidiaries.

    Securities
    Services


 


    Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing
    services and securities lending services to institutional
    clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and
    foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide.


 


    Prime brokerage services.  We offer prime
    brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility
    to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for
    financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime
    brokerage business provides clearing and custody in
    53 markets globally and provides consolidated
    multi-currency accounting and reporting, fund administration and
    other ancillary services.


 


    Financing services.  A central element of our
    prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our
    clients for their securities trading activities through margin
    and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash
    or other acceptable collateral.


 


    Securities lending services.  Securities
    lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending
    of securities to cover clients’ and Goldman Sachs’
    short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In
    addition, we are an active participant in the
    broker-to-broker
    securities lending business and the
    third-party
    agency lending business. As a general matter, net revenues in
    securities lending services in our second quarter are higher due
    to seasonally higher activity levels in Europe.



 



    Global Investment
    Research


 


    Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on
    companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and
    macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.


 


    Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of
    December 2009 provided research coverage of more than 3,000
    companies worldwide and over 45 national economies. This is
    accomplished by the following departments:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    The Equity Research Departments provide fundamental analysis,
    earnings forecasts and investment opinions for equity securities;




 



     
        • 

    
    The Credit Research Department provides fundamental analysis,
    forecasts and investment opinions as to
    investment-grade
    and
    high-yield
    corporate bonds and credit derivatives; and








    13








Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    The Global ECS Department formulates macroeconomic forecasts for
    economic activity, foreign exchange and interest rates, provides
    research on the commodity markets, and provides equity market
    forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector
    allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies
    and options research.





 


    Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is
    provided below under “— Regulation —
    Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States”
    and “Legal Proceedings — Research Independence
    Matters” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report
    on
    Form 10-K.



 



    Business
    Continuity and Information Security


 


    Business continuity and information security are high priorities
    for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been
    developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity
    in the event of disruptions at the firm’s critical
    facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Because we are a bank
    holding company, our Business Continuity Program is also subject
    to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements of the
    program are crisis management, people recovery facilities,
    business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process
    improvement. In the area of information security, we have
    developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies
    and technology to protect the information assets of the firm and
    our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the
    confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
    resources.



 



    Employees


 


    Management believes that a major strength and principal reason
    for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication
    of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We
    strive to maintain a work environment that fosters
    professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our
    employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.


 


    Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a
    continuous process, in which training plays an important part.
    All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in
    education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various
    locations throughout the world. Another important part of
    instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review
    process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and
    employees they supervise in a
    360-degree
    review process that is integral to our team approach.


 


    As of December 2009, we had 32,500 total staff, excluding
    staff at consolidated entities held for investment purposes. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Results of
    Operations — Operating Expenses” in Part II,
    Item 7 of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for additional information on our consolidated entities held for
    investment purposes.



 



    Competition


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that
    provide investment banking, securities and investment management
    services, as well as those entities that make investments in
    securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and
    other financial assets. These entities include brokers and
    dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance
    companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,
    private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of
    our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product
    or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,
    including transaction execution, our products and services,
    innovation, reputation and price.





    14








Table of Contents





    We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining
    qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete
    effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to
    attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing
    employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively
    amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation
    practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and
    those of our principal competitors are subject to review by, and
    the standards of, the Federal Reserve Board and regulators
    outside the United States, including the Financial Services
    Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom. See
    “Regulation — Banking Regulation —
    Compensation Practices” below and “Risk
    Factors — Our businesses may be adversely affected if
    we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees” in
    Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for more information on the regulation of our compensation
    practices.


 


    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
    This trend accelerated in recent years as the credit crisis
    caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry
    participants. Many commercial banks and other
    broad-based
    financial services firms have had the ability for some time to
    offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and
    insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking
    services, which may enhance their competitive position. They
    also have had the ability to support investment banking and
    securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other
    financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share,
    which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking
    and trading businesses and could result in pricing pressure in
    other of our businesses.


 


    Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,
    pressure to retain market share by committing capital to
    businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may
    not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate
    clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate
    in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities)
    from financial services firms in connection with investment
    banking and other assignments.


 


    We provide these commitments primarily through GS Bank USA and
    its subsidiaries (including the William Street entities) and
    through Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC. With respect to most
    of these commitments, SMFG provides us with credit loss
    protection that is generally limited to 95% of the first loss we
    realize on approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of
    approximately $950 million. In addition, subject to the
    satisfaction of certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will
    provide protection for 70% of additional losses on such
    commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13 billion, of which
    $375 million of protection has been provided as of
    December 2009. We also use other financial instruments to
    mitigate credit risks related to certain of these commitments
    that are not covered by SMFG. See Note 8 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for more information regarding the William Street entities and
    for a description of the credit loss protection provided by
    SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with
    investment banking and other assignments are made through GS
    Bank USA and its subsidiaries (other than the William Street
    entities) or our other subsidiaries. In addition, an increasing
    number of these commitments do not benefit from the SMFG loss
    protection.


 


    The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly
    increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our
    competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of
    the securities and other financial services markets. As a
    result, we have had to commit capital to support our
    international operations and to execute large global
    transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant
    challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete
    successfully with financial institutions that are larger and
    better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence
    and longer operating history outside the United States.


 


    We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
    businesses in recent years. For example, over the past several
    years the increasing volume of trades executed electronically,
    through the internet and through alternative trading systems,
    has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that
    commissions for
    “low-touch”
    electronic trading are generally lower than for






    15








Table of Contents





    “high-touch”
    non-electronic
    trading. It appears that this trend toward electronic and other
    “low-touch,”
    low-commission
    trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will
    continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other
    areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain
    market share by further reducing prices.



 



    Regulation


 


    Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the banking, securities,
    commodity futures and options and insurance industries, is
    subject to extensive regulation in the United States and the
    other countries in which we operate. See “Risk
    Factors — Our businesses and those of our clients are
    subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the
    world” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have
    on our businesses. As a matter of public policy, regulatory
    bodies around the world are charged with safeguarding the
    integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with
    protecting the interests of clients participating in those
    markets, including depositors in U.S. depository
    institutions such as GS Bank USA. They are not, however,
    generally charged with protecting the interests of Goldman
    Sachs’ shareholders or creditors.


 


    Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals in the
    United States and internationally for potentially significant
    changes in the regulation of the financial services industry.
    See “Risk Factors — Our business and those of our
    clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around
    the world” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of some of these proposals and their
    potential impact on us.


 



    Banking
    Regulation


 


    On September 21, 2008, Group Inc. became a bank
    holding company under the BHC Act. As of that date, the Federal
    Reserve Board became the primary U.S. regulator of
    Group Inc., as a consolidated entity. As of
    August 14, 2009, Group Inc. elected to become a
    financial holding company under the
    U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley
    Act of 1999 (GLB Act), as described below.


 



    Supervision
    and Regulation


 


    As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under
    the BHC Act, Group Inc. is subject to supervision and
    examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the system of
    “functional regulation” established under the BHC Act,
    the Federal Reserve Board supervises Group Inc., including
    all of its nonbank subsidiaries, as an “umbrella
    regulator” of the consolidated organization and generally
    defers to the primary U.S. regulators of
    Group Inc.’s U.S. depository institution
    subsidiary, as applicable, and to the other U.S. regulators
    of Group Inc.’s
    U.S. non-depository
    institution subsidiaries that regulate certain activities of
    those subsidiaries. Such “functionally regulated”
    non-depository
    institution subsidiaries include
    broker-dealers
    registered with the SEC, such as our principal
    U.S. broker-dealer,
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), insurance
    companies regulated by state insurance authorities, investment
    advisors registered with the SEC with respect to their
    investment advisory activities and entities regulated by the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with
    respect to certain futures-related activities.


 



    Activities


 


    The BHC Act generally restricts bank holding companies from
    engaging in business activities other than the business of
    banking and certain closely related activities. As a financial
    holding company under the GLB Act, we may engage in a broader
    range of financial and related activities than are permissible
    for bank holding companies as long as we continue to meet the
    eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. These
    activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in
    securities, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking
    investments in nonfinancial companies. In addition, we are
    permitted under the GLB Act to continue to engage in






    16








Table of Contents





    certain commodities activities in the United States that were
    impermissible for bank holding companies as of
    September 30, 1997, if the assets held pursuant to
    these activities do not equal 5% or more of our consolidated
    assets. Our ability to maintain financial holding company status
    is dependent on a number of factors, including our
    U.S. depository institution subsidiaries continuing to
    qualify as “well capitalized” and
    “well-managed” as described under
    “— Prompt
    Corrective Action” below.


 


    Although we do not believe that any activities that are material
    to our current or currently proposed business are impermissible
    activities for us as a financial holding company, the BHC Act
    also grants a new bank holding company, such as Group Inc.,
    two years from the date the entity becomes a bank holding
    company to comply with the restrictions on its activities
    imposed by the BHC Act with respect to any activities in which
    it was engaged when it became a bank holding company. In
    addition, under the BHC Act, we can apply to the Federal Reserve
    Board for up to three
    one-year
    extensions.


 


    As a bank holding company, Group Inc. is required to obtain
    prior Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or
    indirectly acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares
    of any unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a
    bank holding company, we may generally engage in banking and
    other financial activities abroad, including investing in and
    owning
    non-U.S. banks,
    if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits
    and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board.


 



    Capital
    Requirements


 


    We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered
    by the U.S. federal banking agencies. Our bank depository
    institution subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to
    similar capital requirements. Under the Federal Reserve
    Board’s capital adequacy requirements and the regulatory
    framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that is applicable
    to GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs and its bank depository
    institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital requirements
    that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and
    certain
    off-balance-sheet
    items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices.
    Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution
    subsidiaries’ capital amounts, as well as GS Bank
    USA’s PCA classification, are also subject to qualitative
    judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings
    and other factors.


 


    We report capital ratios computed in accordance with the
    regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank
    holding companies, which are based on the Capital Accord of the
    Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I). These ratios
    are used by the Federal Reserve Board and other
    U.S. federal banking agencies in the supervisory review
    process, including the assessment of the firm’s capital
    adequacy.


 


    Our Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders’
    equity, qualifying preferred stock and our junior subordinated
    debt issued to trusts, less deductions for goodwill, disallowed
    intangible assets and other items. Our total capital consists of
    our Tier 1 capital and our qualifying subordinated debt,
    less certain deductions. Our total capital ratio is equal to
    total capital as a percentage of
    Risk-Weighted
    Assets (RWAs), which are calculated in accordance with the
    Federal Reserve Board’s
    risk-based
    capital requirements, and our Tier 1 capital ratio is equal
    to Tier 1 capital as a percentage of RWAs. The calculation
    of RWAs is based on the amount of the firm’s market risk
    and credit risk. Certain measures included in the calculation of
    the firm’s RWAs for market risk are under review by the
    Federal Reserve Board. Additional information on the calculation
    of our Tier 1 capital, total capital and RWAs is set forth
    in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Equity
    Capital — Consolidated Capital Requirements,” and
    in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, which
    are in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    As of December 2009, our total capital ratio was 18.2%, and
    our Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0%.

    We are currently working to implement the requirements set out
    in the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of
    Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel
    Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II) as applicable
    to us as a bank holding company. U.S. banking regulators
    have incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing
    risk-based
    capital requirements by requiring that internationally active
    banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to
    Basel II over several years. During a parallel period, we
    anticipate that Group Inc.’s capital calculations
    computed under both the Basel I rules and the Basel II rules
    will be reported to the Federal Reserve Board for examination
    and compliance for at least four consecutive quarterly periods.
    Once the parallel period and subsequent three-year transition
    period are successfully completed, Group Inc. will utilize
    the Basel II framework as its means of capital adequacy
    assessment, measurement and reporting and will discontinue use
    of Basel I. The Basel II framework was implemented in several
    countries during the second half of 2007 and in 2008, while
    others began implementation in 2009. The Basel II rules
    therefore already apply to certain of our operations in
    non-U.S. jurisdictions.


 


    The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage
    ratio requirements. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as
    Tier 1 capital under Basel I divided by adjusted average
    total assets (which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill
    and certain intangible assets). The minimum Tier 1 leverage
    ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that have received the
    highest supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board
    guidelines or that have implemented the Federal Reserve
    Board’s
    risk-based
    capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies
    must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Bank
    holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above
    the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition,
    risk profile and growth plans. As of December 2009, our
    Tier 1 leverage ratio under Basel I was 7.6%.


 



    Payment of
    Dividends


 


    Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of
    dividends by our bank depository institution subsidiaries. The
    amount of dividends that may be paid by a state-chartered bank
    that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as GS Bank
    USA or our national bank trust company subsidiary, is limited to
    the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent
    earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test.
    Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if
    the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar
    year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined
    with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless
    the bank obtains the approval of its chartering authority. Under
    the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess
    of a bank’s “undivided profits.” New York law
    imposes similar limitations on New York State-chartered banks.
    As of December 2009, GS Bank USA could have declared
    dividends of $3.30 billion to Group Inc. in accordance
    with these limitations. In addition to the dividend restrictions
    described above, the banking regulators have authority to
    prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking
    organizations they supervise if, in the banking regulator’s
    opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or
    unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the
    banking organization.


 


    It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank
    holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out
    of net income available to common shareholders over the past
    year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention
    appears consistent with the bank holding company’s capital
    needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the
    current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve
    Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully
    review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend
    pay-out ratios that are at the 100% level unless both asset
    quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also
    should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure
    on the capital of bank depository institution subsidiaries, or
    that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to
    serve as a source of strength for such bank depository
    institution subsidiaries. Under temporary guidelines in effect
    for the “near- to
    medium-term,”
    certain large bank holding companies (including Group Inc.)
    are required to






    18








Table of Contents





    consult with the Federal Reserve Board before increasing
    dividends. In addition, certain of Group Inc.’s
    nonbank subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory
    limitations on dividends and distributions, including our
    broker-dealer
    and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.


 



    Source of
    Strength


 


    Under Federal Reserve Board policy, Group Inc. is expected
    to act as a source of strength to GS Bank USA and to commit
    capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary. Such
    support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times
    when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital
    loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks
    are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain
    other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a
    bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the
    bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the
    capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy
    trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.


 


    However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation
    of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the
    BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring
    payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository
    institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to
    such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could
    instead require the divestiture of the depository institution
    and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.


 



    Cross-guarantee
    Provisions


 


    Each insured depository institution “controlled” (as
    defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be
    held liable to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be
    incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other insured
    depository institution controlled by that holding company and
    for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of those banks
    that is in danger of default. Such a “cross-guarantee”
    claim against a depository institution is generally superior in
    right of payment to claims of the holding company and its
    affiliates against that depository institution. At this time, we
    control only one insured depository institution for this
    purpose, namely GS Bank USA. However, if, in the future, we were
    to control other insured depository institutions, such
    cross-guarantee would apply to all such insured depository
    institutions.


 



    Compensation
    Practices


 


    Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the
    Federal Reserve Board. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve
    Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation
    policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by
    the Federal Reserve Board, including bank holding companies such
    as Group Inc. The proposal sets forth three key principles
    for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to
    help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage
    excessive
    risk-taking
    and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking
    organizations. The three principles provide that a banking
    organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should
    provide incentives that do not encourage
    risk-taking
    beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify
    and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls
    and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate
    governance. The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by
    the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies
    and practices of a number of “large, complex banking
    organizations,” including us. Any deficiencies in
    compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated
    into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can
    affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other
    actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be
    taken against a banking organization if its incentive
    compensation arrangements or related
    risk-management
    control or governance processes pose a risk to the
    organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is
    not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the
    deficiencies. The scope and content of the Federal Reserve
    Board’s policies on executive compensation are continuing
    to develop, and we expect that these policies will evolve over a
    number of years.

    In September 2009, the Financial Stability Board,
    established at the direction of the leaders of the Group of 20,
    released standards for implementing certain compensation
    principles for banks and other financial companies designed to
    encourage sound compensation practices. These standards are to
    be implemented by local regulators. Thus far, regulators in a
    number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France and
    Germany, have proposed or adopted policies related to
    compensation at financial institutions. These policies are in
    addition to the proposals made by the Federal Reserve Board in
    October 2009. The United Kingdom has proposed a
    non-deductible 50% tax on certain financial institutions in
    respect of discretionary bonuses in excess of £25,000
    awarded under arrangements made between
    December 9, 2009 and April 5, 2010 to
    “relevant banking employees.” Separately, the FDIC has
    solicited comments on whether to amend its
    risk-based
    deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase
    assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation
    programs that put the Deposit Insurance Fund at risk.


 



    FDIC Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program


 


    Group Inc. and GS Bank USA participated in the FDIC’s
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which applied to,
    among others, all U.S. depository institutions insured by
    the FDIC and all U.S. bank holding companies, unless they
    opted out of the TLGP or the FDIC terminated their
    participation. Under the TLGP, the FDIC guarantees certain
    senior unsecured debt of Group Inc., and, until
    December 31, 2009, guaranteed noninterest-bearing
    transaction account deposits at GS Bank USA, and in return for
    these guarantees the FDIC was paid a fee based on the amount of
    the deposit or the amount and maturity of the debt. Under the
    debt guarantee component of the TLGP, the FDIC will pay the
    unpaid principal and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt
    instrument upon the uncured failure of the participating entity
    to make a timely payment of principal or interest in accordance
    with the terms of the instrument. We have not issued
    long-term
    debt under the TLGP since March 2009, and all of our
    previously issued debt under the TLGP will mature on or prior to
    June 15, 2012. The debt guarantee component expired
    with respect to new issuances by us on
    October 31, 2009. Effective January 1, 2010,
    GS Bank USA is not participating in the transaction account
    guarantee component of the TLGP. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Funding Risk —
    Asset-Liability Management” in Part II, Item 7 of
    this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of our participation in the TLGP.


 



    GS Bank
    USA


 


    Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, GS Bank USA, a
    New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal
    Reserve System and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve
    Board and the New York State Banking Department and is subject
    to minimum capital requirements that (subject to certain
    exceptions) are similar to those applicable to bank holding
    companies. A number of our businesses are conducted partially or
    entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including:
    bank loan trading and origination; interest rate, credit,
    currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial
    and residential mortgage origination, trading and servicing;
    structured finance; and agency lending, custody and hedge fund
    administration services. These businesses are subject to
    regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the New York State
    Banking Department and the FDIC.


 



    Deposit
    Insurance


 


    GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the
    benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The
    FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on
    insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk
    category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits
    that it holds. The FDIC required us to prepay our estimated
    assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on
    December 30, 2009. The FDIC may increase or decrease
    the assessment rate schedule on a
    semi-annual
    basis. We also participated in the TLGP as discussed above under
    “— FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program.”

    Prompt
    Corrective Action


 


    The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
    Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal
    banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in
    respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified
    capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories
    for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately
    capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
    and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution is
    generally deemed to be “well capitalized,” the highest
    category, if it has a total capital ratio of 10% or greater, a
    Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or greater and a Tier 1
    leverage ratio of 5% or greater. In connection with the
    November 2008 asset transfer described under
    “— Transactions with Affiliates” below, GS
    Bank USA agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to minimum
    capital ratios in excess of these “well capitalized”
    levels. Accordingly, for a period of time, GS Bank USA is
    expected to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%,
    a total capital ratio of at least 11% and a Tier 1 leverage
    ratio of at least 6%. As of December 2009, GS Bank
    USA’s Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.9%, its total
    capital ratio was 19.3% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was
    15.4%. GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance
    with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to
    state member banks, which are based on Basel I as implemented by
    the Federal Reserve Board. An institution may be downgraded to,
    or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is
    indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an
    unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory
    examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA
    imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
    operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital
    category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital
    requirements could also subject a depository institution to
    capital raising requirements. Ultimately, critically
    undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of
    a receiver or conservator.


 


    The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to
    depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such
    as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is
    authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company
    level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding
    company’s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain
    instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution
    subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to
    guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized
    subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable
    for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments
    on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy
    of the parent holding company, the guarantee would take priority
    over the parent’s general unsecured creditors.


 



    Insolvency of
    an Insured Depository Institution


 


    If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an
    insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its
    insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and
    liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the
    depository institution’s creditors;




 



     
        • 

    
    to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s
    contracts pursuant to their terms; or




 



     
        • 

    
    to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the
    depository institution is a party, the performance of which is
    determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or
    repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the
    orderly administration of the depository institution.








    21








Table of Contents




 


    In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit
    liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses
    against an insured depository institution would be afforded a
    priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
    institution, including claims of debt holders of the
    institution, in the “liquidation or other resolution”
    of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or
    not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS
    Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently from,
    and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the
    depositors of the depository institution.


 



    Transactions
    with Affiliates


 


    Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and its
    subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve
    Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of
    transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from GS
    Bank USA) that may take place and generally require those
    transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These regulations
    generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and
    its subsidiaries. In November 2008, Group Inc.
    transferred assets and operations to GS Bank USA. In connection
    with this transfer, Group Inc. entered into a guarantee
    agreement with GS Bank USA whereby Group Inc. agreed to
    (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain transferred assets
    (other than derivatives and mortgage servicing rights) or
    reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses relating to those
    assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for
    credit-related
    losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA; and
    (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain
    losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights
    transferred to GS Bank USA. In accordance with the
    guarantee agreement, as of December 2009, Group Inc.
    is also required to pledge approximately $4 billion of
    collateral to GS Bank USA.


 



    Trust Companies


 


    Group Inc.’s two limited purpose trust company
    subsidiaries operate under state or federal law. They are not
    permitted to and do not accept deposits or make loans (other
    than as incidental to their trust activities) and, as a result,
    are not insured by the FDIC. The Goldman Sachs
    Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association that is
    limited to fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the
    Federal Reserve System. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company of
    Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose trust company, is regulated
    by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner.


 



    U.S. Securities
    and Commodities Regulation


 


    Goldman Sachs’
    broker-dealer
    subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects
    of the securities business, including sales methods, trade
    practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and
    securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of
    clients’ purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers
    and employees.


 


    In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible
    for the administration of the federal securities laws.
    GS&Co. is registered as a
    broker-dealer
    and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a
    broker-dealer
    in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory
    organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that
    apply to, and examine,
    broker-dealers
    such as GS&Co. In addition, state securities and other
    regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over
    GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to
    regulation by various
    non-U.S. governmental
    and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in
    virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs
    Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and one of its
    subsidiaries are registered
    U.S. broker-dealers
    and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs
    Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC
    derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives
    businesses.

    The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the
    United States is subject to regulation under the
    U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal
    agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of
    Goldman Sachs’ subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and
    GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission
    merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading
    advisors and are subject to the CEA. The rules and regulations
    of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago
    Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other
    futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also
    govern the commodity futures and commodity options businesses of
    these entities.


 


    GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to
    Rule 15c3-1
    of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform
    minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require
    that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept
    in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to
    compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with
    the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted
    by
    Rule 15c3-1.
    As of December 2009, GS&Co. had regulatory net
    capital, as defined by
    Rule 15c3-1,
    of $13.65 billion, which exceeded the amount required by
    $11.81 billion. As of December 2009, GSEC had
    regulatory net capital, as defined by
    Rule 15c3-1,
    of $1.97 billion, which exceeded the amount required by
    $1.86 billion. In addition to its alternative minimum net
    capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold
    tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net
    capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the
    market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of
    Rule 15c3-1.
    GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that
    its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of
    December 2009, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and
    net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification
    requirements. These net capital requirements may have the effect
    of prohibiting these entities from distributing or withdrawing
    capital and may require prior notice to the SEC for certain
    withdrawals of capital. See Note 17 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.

    Other Regulation
    in the United States


 


    Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
    insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they
    are domiciled and in the other states in which they are
    licensed, and Group Inc. is subject to oversight as an
    insurance holding company in states where our insurance
    subsidiaries are domiciled. State insurance regulations limit
    the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to
    Group Inc. in certain circumstances, and could require
    regulatory approval for any change in “control” of
    Group Inc., which may include control of 10% or more of our
    voting stock. In addition, a number of our other businesses,
    including our lending and mortgage businesses, require us to
    obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject
    to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we
    conduct these businesses.


 


    The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA
    PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money
    laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the
    implementation of various regulations applicable to all
    financial institutions, including standards for verifying client
    identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor
    client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through
    these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to
    promote the identification of parties that may be involved in
    terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.
    Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain
    some similar provisions. The obligation of financial
    institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their
    clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to
    respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities
    and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with
    other financial institutions, has required the implementation
    and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls
    that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs,
    and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could
    subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.


 



    Regulation Outside
    the United States


 


    Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the
    United Kingdom under the regulation of the FSA. Goldman Sachs
    International (GSI), our regulated U.K.
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements imposed by the FSA. As of
    December 2009, GSI was in compliance with the FSA capital
    requirements. Other subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs
    International Bank, are also regulated by the FSA.


 


    Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe), our regulated
    Irish bank, is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed

    Autorité des Marchés Financiers in France, Banca
    d’Italia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società
    e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial Markets
    Service in Russia and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
    Authority. Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by
    the European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges
    of which they are members.


 


    The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA
    and other regulators within the European Union (EU) are
    regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which
    implement EU directives requiring, among other things,
    compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer
    protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting
    rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly
    implemented, under the same directives, throughout the EU.

    Regulations
    Applicable in and Outside the United States


 


    The U.S. and
    non-U.S. government
    agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,
    as well as state securities commissions and other state
    regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct
    administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the
    issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or
    expulsion of a
    broker-dealer
    or its directors, officers or employees. From time to time, our
    subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and
    proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of
    various regulations relating to our activities, none of which
    has had a material adverse effect on us or our businesses.


 


    The SEC and FINRA have rules governing research analysts,
    including rules imposing restrictions on the interaction between
    equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at
    member securities firms. Various
    non-U.S. jurisdictions
    have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements
    with respect to research and may impose additional regulations.
    In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement with certain
    federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory
    organizations to resolve investigations into equity research
    analysts’ alleged conflicts of interest. The global
    settlement includes certain restrictions and undertakings that
    impose costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses,
    including restrictions on the interaction between research and
    investment banking areas.


 


    Our investment management businesses are subject to significant
    regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating
    to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and
    our management of client funds.


 


    As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold
    capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency
    requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning
    the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based
    upon its underlying risk.


 


    Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with
    regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,
    the European Union or other jurisdictions
    and/or
    enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges
    relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees
    or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations
    could expose us to liability
    and/or
    reputational damage.

    Item 1A.  Risk
    Factors


 


    We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in
    our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,
    operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The
    following are some of the more important factors that could
    affect our businesses.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
    conditions in the global financial markets and economic
    conditions generally.


 


    Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable
    earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by
    conditions in the global financial markets and economic
    conditions generally. In the past several years, these
    conditions have changed suddenly and, for a period of time, very
    negatively.


 


    In 2008 and through early 2009, the financial services industry
    and the securities markets generally were materially and
    adversely affected by significant declines in the values of
    nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity.
    This was initially triggered by declines in the values of
    subprime mortgages, but spread to all mortgage and real estate
    asset classes, to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset
    classes, including equities. The global markets during this
    period were characterized by substantially increased volatility
    and
    short-selling
    and an overall loss of investor and public confidence. The
    decline in asset values caused increases in margin calls for
    investors, requirements that derivatives counterparties post
    additional collateral and redemptions by mutual and hedge fund
    investors, all of which increased the downward pressure on asset
    values and outflows of client funds across the financial
    services industry. While the markets have generally stabilized
    and improved since the first quarter of 2009, asset values for
    many asset classes have not returned to previous levels.
    Business, financial and economic conditions, particularly
    unemployment levels, lending activities and the housing markets,
    continue to be negatively impacted by the events of recent years.


 


    Market conditions led to the failure or merger of a number of
    prominent financial institutions. Financial institution failures
    or near-failures resulted in further losses as a consequence of
    defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under
    bilateral derivatives and other contracts entered into with such
    entities as counterparties. Furthermore, declining asset values,
    defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market
    and investor confidence, as well as other factors, combined to
    increase credit default swap spreads, to cause rating agencies
    to lower credit ratings, and to otherwise increase the cost and
    decrease the availability of liquidity, despite very significant
    declines in central bank borrowing rates and other government
    actions.


 


    Banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and
    some have become reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due
    to the increased risk of default, the impact of declining asset
    values on the value of collateral and the impact of
    “risky” assets and transactions on capital
    requirements. In addition, some financial institutions are
    unwilling to sell assets where the value of such assets are not
    “marked-to-market”
    and would have to be sold at a loss because they are worth
    significantly less than their current book value. The markets
    for securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, loans,
    credit card receivables and other assets, which for the most
    part were closed during 2008 and the beginning of 2009, have
    very recently begun to reopen.


 


    Since 2008, governments, regulators and central banks in the
    United States and worldwide have taken numerous steps to
    increase liquidity and to restore investor and public
    confidence. In addition, there are numerous legislative and
    regulatory actions that have been taken or proposed to deal with
    what regulators, politicians and others believe to be the root
    causes of the financial crisis, including proposals relating to
    financial institution capital requirements and compensation
    practices, proposals relating to restrictions on the type of
    activities in which financial institutions are permitted to
    engage and the size of financial institutions, and proposals to
    impose additional taxes on certain financial institutions, as
    well as proposals calling for increased regulatory scrutiny and
    coordination with respect to the financial services industry and
    markets. It is presently unclear which of these proposals will
    be adopted and in what form and whether the net effect of such
    proposals will in fact be positive or negative for the financial
    markets over either the short or
    long-term.

    During 2009, the economies of the United States, Europe and
    Japan experienced a recession. Business activity across a wide
    range of industries and regions has been greatly reduced and
    many companies were, and some continue to be, in serious
    difficulty due to reduced consumer spending and low levels of
    liquidity in the credit markets. National and local governments
    are facing difficult financial conditions due to significant
    reductions in tax revenues, particularly from corporate and
    personal income taxes, as well as increased outlays for
    unemployment benefits due to high unemployment levels and the
    cost of stimulus programs.


 


    Declines in asset values, the lack of liquidity, general
    uncertainty about economic and market activities and a lack of
    consumer, investor and CEO confidence have negatively impacted
    many of our businesses, including our investment banking,
    merchant banking, asset management, leveraged lending and equity
    principal strategies businesses.


 


    Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment
    in which our businesses operate. A favorable business
    environment is generally characterized by, among other factors,
    high global gross domestic product growth, transparent, liquid
    and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and
    investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions, and strong
    business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market
    conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth,
    business activity or investor or business confidence;
    limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of
    credit and capital; increases in inflation, interest rates,
    exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic
    commodities; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical
    instability; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce
    investor confidence in capital markets; natural disasters or
    pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.


 


    The business environment became generally more favorable after
    the first quarter of 2009, but there can be no assurance that
    these conditions will continue in the near or long term. If they
    do not, our results of operations may be adversely affected.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may be adversely affected by declining asset
    values.


 


    Many of our businesses, such as our merchant banking businesses,
    our mortgages, leveraged loan and credit products businesses in
    our FICC segment, and our equity principal strategies business,
    have net “long” positions in debt securities, loans,
    derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity) and
    most other asset classes. In addition, many of our
    market-making
    and other businesses in which we act as a principal to
    facilitate our clients’ activities, including our
    exchange-based
    market-making
    businesses, commit large amounts of capital to maintain trading
    positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as
    currencies, commodities and equities. Because nearly all of
    these investing and trading positions are
    marked-to-market
    on a daily basis, declines in asset values directly and
    immediately impact our earnings, unless we have effectively
    “hedged” our exposures to such declines. In certain
    circumstances (particularly in the case of leveraged loans and
    private equities or other securities that are not freely
    tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may
    not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the
    extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly
    reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the
    assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices
    of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading
    markets for certain assets, which may make it very difficult to
    sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or
    effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in
    such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may require
    us to maintain additional capital and increase our funding costs.


 


    In our exchange-based
    market-making
    businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain
    an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining
    market. In markets where asset values are declining and in
    volatile markets, this results in trading losses and an
    increased need for liquidity.





    27








Table of Contents




 


    We receive
    asset-based
    management fees based on the value of our clients’
    portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some
    cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the
    value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the
    value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in
    turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.


 


    We post collateral to support our obligations and receive
    collateral to support the obligations of our clients and
    counterparties in connection with our trading businesses. When
    the value of the assets posted as collateral declines, the party
    posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral
    or, if possible, reduce its trading position. A classic example
    of such a situation is a “margin call” in connection
    with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of
    asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of
    funding trading positions is increased or the size of trading
    positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral
    this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if
    we are the party receiving collateral this can also reduce our
    profitability by reducing the level of business done with our
    clients and counterparties. In addition, volatile or less liquid
    markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets which can lead
    to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the
    level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk
    to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving
    adequate collateral.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may be adversely affected by disruptions in the
    credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher
    costs of obtaining credit.


 


    Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the
    availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our
    ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so
    in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by
    issuing
    long-term
    debt, promissory notes and commercial paper, by accepting
    deposits at our bank subsidiaries or by obtaining bank loans or
    lines of credit. We seek to finance many of our assets on a
    secured basis, including by entering into repurchase agreements.
    Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and
    more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our
    available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our
    operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to
    curtail our business activities and increase our cost of
    funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,
    particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending
    and taking principal positions, including market making.


 


    Our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on
    access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance
    their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased
    cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing
    of our clients’ merger and acquisition
    transactions — particularly large
    transactions — and adversely affect our financial
    advisory and underwriting businesses.


 


    In addition, we may incur significant unrealized gains or losses
    due solely to changes in our credit spreads or those of third
    parties, as these changes may affect the fair value of our
    derivative instruments and the debt securities that we hold or
    issue.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may be affected by changes in the levels of market
    volatility.


 


    Certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to
    provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in
    volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect
    the results of these businesses. On the other hand, increased
    volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,
    also increases risk as measured by VaR and may expose us to
    increased risks in connection with our
    market-making
    and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of
    these businesses in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting
    the size of our
    market-making
    positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our
    profitability, even though spreads are widening and we may earn
    more on each trade. In periods when volatility is increasing,
    but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be
    possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do
    so at steep discounts. In such circumstances we may be forced to
    either take on additional risk or to incur losses in order to
    decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase
    the level of our risk weighted assets and increase our capital
    requirements which in turn increases our funding costs.

    Our businesses
    have been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely
    affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among
    investors and CEOs due to general declines in economic activity
    and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market
    conditions.


 


    Our investment banking business has been and may continue to be
    adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic
    conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can
    adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO
    confidence, resulting in significant
    industry-wide
    declines in the size and number of underwritings and of
    financial advisory transactions, which could have an adverse
    effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular,
    because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues
    is derived from our participation in large transactions, a
    decline in the number of large transactions would adversely
    affect our investment banking business.


 


    In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines
    in market or economic activity may affect our trading businesses
    by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing
    volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even
    declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes
    or higher spreads or both.


 


    Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions,
    as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to
    transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or
    their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues,
    principally in our asset management business. To the extent that
    clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in
    products that generate less fee income.


 



    Our investing
    businesses may be affected by the poor investment performance of
    our investment products.


 


    Poor investment returns in our asset management business, due to
    either general market conditions or underperformance (against
    the performance of benchmarks or of our competitors) by funds or
    accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or
    sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to
    attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.
    This could affect the asset management and incentive fees that
    we earn on assets under management or the commissions that we
    earn for selling other investment products, such as structured
    notes or derivatives.


 


    We have in the past provided financial support to certain of our
    investment products in difficult market circumstances and, at
    our discretion, we may decide to do so in the future for
    reputational or business reasons, including through equity
    investments or cash infusions.


 



    We may incur
    losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and
    strategies.


 


    We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk
    and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but
    complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and
    legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review
    processes and other mechanisms. Our trading risk management
    process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading
    positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ
    a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk
    mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that
    accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and
    financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.
    Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.
    Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented
    dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using
    historical data to manage risk.





    29








Table of Contents





    The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures
    reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack
    thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market
    indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen
    circumstances, such as occurred during 2008 and early 2009,
    previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or
    conversely previously correlated indicators may move in
    different directions. These types of market movements have at
    times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and
    have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so
    in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated
    where other market participants are using risk or trading models
    with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In
    these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk
    positions due to the activity of other market participants or
    widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where
    asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for
    certain assets. To the extent that we make investments directly
    through various of our businesses in securities, including
    private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading
    market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or
    hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and
    therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In
    addition, we invest our own capital in our merchant banking,
    alternative investment and infrastructure funds, and limitations
    on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in
    these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons,
    may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures
    relating to these investments.


 


    For a further discussion of our risk management policies and
    procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Our liquidity,
    profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an
    inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets
    or by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an increase in our
    credit spreads.


 


    Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity may be
    impaired by an inability to access secured
    and/or
    unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our
    subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our
    investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This
    situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable
    to control, such as a general market disruption or an
    operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by
    the perception among market participants that we, or other
    market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.


 


    The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to
    which we are a party are complex, as we employ structured
    products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex
    structured products often do not have readily available markets
    to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing activities
    may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities
    represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could
    restrict liquidity for our positions. Further, our ability to
    sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are
    seeking to sell similar assets at the same time, as is likely to
    occur in a liquidity or other market crisis. In addition,
    financial institutions with which we interact may exercise
    set-off rights or the right to require additional collateral,
    including in difficult market conditions, which could further
    impair our access to liquidity.


 


    Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction
    in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
    competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our
    access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under
    certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and
    collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,
    counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with
    Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.
    Termination of our trading and collateralized financing
    contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our
    liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or
    to make significant cash payments or securities movements.

    Our cost of obtaining
    long-term
    unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the
    amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury
    securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same maturity
    that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our
    credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this
    funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous,
    market-driven,
    and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile
    movements. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions
    of our creditworthiness. In addition, our credit spreads may be
    influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit
    default swaps referenced to our
    long-term
    debt. The market for credit default swaps is relatively new,
    although very large, and it has proven to be extremely volatile
    and currently lacks a high degree of structure or transparency.


 



    Group Inc.
    is a holding company and is dependent for liquidity on payments
    from its subsidiaries, which are subject to
    restrictions.


 


    Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on
    dividends, distributions and other payments from its
    subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments
    on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our
    subsidiaries, including our
    broker-dealer,
    bank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws that
    restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to
    block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
    Group Inc. In addition, our
    broker-dealer,
    bank and insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on
    their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum
    regulatory capital requirements, as well as restrictions on
    their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or
    bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions
    on related-party transactions, increased capital requirements
    and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in
    bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can
    reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of
    Group Inc. and even require Group Inc. to provide
    additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or
    regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that
    Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations,
    including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition,
    Group Inc.’s right to participate in a distribution of
    assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is
    subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.


 


    Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment
    obligations of GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GS Bank Europe,
    subject to certain exceptions, and has pledged significant
    assets to GS Bank USA to support obligations to GS Bank USA. In
    addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of
    its other consolidated subsidiaries on a
    transaction-by-transaction
    basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may
    require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets
    to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a
    time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its
    own obligations. See “Business — Regulation”
    in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Our
    businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely
    affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults
    by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets
    or whose securities or obligations we hold.


 


    We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,
    securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.
    These parties may default on their obligations to us due to
    bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
    reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even
    concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to
    significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other
    institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.


 


    We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third
    parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In
    addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties
    whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses
    and/or
    adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use
    those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A
    significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our
    counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.
    While in many cases we are permitted to require additional
    collateral from counterparties that experience financial
    difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we
    are entitled to receive and the value of pledged






    31








Table of Contents





    assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on
    collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of
    our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with
    counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase
    significantly in times of market stress and illiquidity.


 


    As part of our clearing business, we finance our client
    positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or
    misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly review credit
    exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific
    industries, countries and regions that we believe may present
    credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or
    circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.


 



    Concentration
    of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses.


 


    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses in our
    market-making,
    proprietary trading, investing, block trading, merchant banking,
    underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to
    the extent we expand our
    market-making,
    trading, investing and lending businesses. The number and size
    of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a
    given period. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we may
    suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are
    generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the
    credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit
    exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend
    large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.
    Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating
    or securitizing these positions, including during periods of
    market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations
    due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including
    due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as
    the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or
    loans.


 


    In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a
    concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,
    borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, and a failure
    or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively
    impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by
    which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure
    to individual entities, industries and countries may not
    function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us
    to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely
    execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the
    financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,
    commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and investment
    funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration
    with respect to this industry. To the extent regulatory or
    market developments lead to an increased centralization of
    trading activity through particular clearing houses, central
    agents or exchanges, this may increase our concentration of risk
    with respect to these entities.


 



    The financial
    services industry is highly competitive.


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of
    factors, including transaction execution, our products and
    services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price.
    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
    This trend accelerated over recent years as a result of numerous
    mergers and asset acquisitions among industry participants. This
    trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and
    other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to
    commit capital to support our international operations and to
    execute large global transactions. To the extent we expand into
    new business areas and new geographic regions, we will face
    competitors with more experience and more established
    relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants
    in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability
    to expand. Governments and regulators have recently put forward
    various proposals that may impact our ability to conduct certain
    of our businesses in a
    cost-effective
    manner or at all, including proposals relating to restrictions
    on the type of activities in which financial institutions are
    permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions, and
    proposals to impose additional taxes on certain financial
    institutions. These or other similar proposals, which may not
    apply to all our competitors, could impact our ability to
    compete effectively.

    Pricing and other competitive pressures in our investment
    banking business, as well as our other businesses, have
    continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of
    our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing
    prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and
    other assignments, we have experienced pressure to extend and
    price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us
    for the risks we take.


 



    We face
    enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact
    with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us
    to new asset classes and new markets.


 


    A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and
    expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,
    directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are
    not within our traditional client and counterparty base and
    expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business
    activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks
    associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational
    concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated
    counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of
    these activities, increased
    credit-related,
    sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or
    acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in
    which these assets are being operated or held.


 



    Derivative
    transactions and delayed settlements may expose us to unexpected
    risk and potential losses.


 


    We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,
    including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative
    instruments are individually negotiated and
    non-standardized,
    which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions
    difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to
    the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other
    obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we
    do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation
    and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or
    other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments
    due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays
    with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as
    increased costs to the firm.


 


    Derivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary
    bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties
    are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a
    timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or
    during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened
    credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may
    find it more difficult to enforce our rights. In addition, as
    new and more complex derivative products are created, covering a
    wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes
    about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which
    could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk
    exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs.
    Any regulatory effort to create an exchange or trading platform
    for credit derivatives and other OTC derivative contracts, or a
    market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the
    risk associated with such transactions, but under certain
    circumstances could also limit our ability to develop
    derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and
    ourselves and adversely affect our profitability and increase
    our credit exposure to such platform.


 



    Our businesses
    may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain
    qualified employees.


 


    Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability
    to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our
    businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and
    geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new employees
    and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition
    from within the financial services industry and from businesses
    outside the financial services industry for qualified employees
    has often been intense. This is particularly the case in
    emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified
    employees with entities that have a significantly greater
    presence or more extensive experience in the region.

    As described further in “Business —
    Regulation — Banking Regulation —
    Compensation Practices” in Part I, Item 1 of this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the
    standards of, the Federal Reserve Board. As a large financial
    and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on
    compensation practices (which may or may not affect our
    competitors) by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC or other
    regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any imposed
    by or as a result of future legislation or regulation or the
    Federal Reserve Board’s proposal on incentive compensation
    policies, may require us to alter our compensation practices in
    ways that could adversely affect our ability to attract and
    retain talented employees. We may also be required to make
    additional disclosure with respect to the compensation of
    employees, including
    non-executive
    officers, in a manner that directly or indirectly results in the
    identity of such employees and their compensation being made
    public. Any such additional public disclosure of employee
    compensation may also make it difficult to attract and retain
    talented employees.


 



    Our businesses
    and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive
    regulation around the world.


 


    As a participant in the financial services industry and a bank
    holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation in
    jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant
    intervention by regulatory and taxing authorities in all
    jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. Among other
    things, as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and
    regulations, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some
    of our business activities, subject to limitations or conditions
    on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially
    higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with
    the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees. In
    addition, recent market disruptions have led to numerous
    proposals in the United States and internationally for changes
    in the regulation and taxation of the financial services
    industry, including increased capital or new liquidity or
    leverage requirements for banks.


 


    There is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes
    in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our
    businesses or those of our clients, including tax burdens and
    compensation restrictions, could be imposed on a limited subset
    of financial institutions (either based on size, activities,
    geography or other criteria), which may adversely affect our
    ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are
    not affected in the same way.


 


    The impact of such developments could impact our profitability
    in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us
    to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such
    jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs
    associated with changing our business practices, restructuring
    our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our
    employees to other locations or complying with applicable
    capital requirements, including liquidating assets or raising
    capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs
    or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.


 


    For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our
    businesses are subject, see “Business —
    Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    We may be
    adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory
    scrutiny or negative publicity.


 


    Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and
    law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to
    compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other
    matters has increased dramatically in the past several years.
    The financial crisis and the current political and public
    sentiment regarding financial institutions has resulted in a
    significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse
    statements or charges by regulators or elected officials. Press
    coverage and other public statements that assert some form of
    wrongdoing, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions
    being made, often results in some type of investigation by
    regulators,






    34








Table of Contents





    legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.
    Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of
    the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time consuming and
    expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior
    management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by
    regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the
    last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely
    in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or
    support legislation targeted at the financial services industry.
    Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and
    enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our
    reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees,
    which could adversely affect our businesses and results of
    operations.


 



    A failure in
    our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third
    parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses,
    result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our
    reputation and cause losses.


 


    Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process
    and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of
    transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous
    and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as
    well as the information technology services we provide to
    clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as
    well as legal and regulatory standards. As our client base and
    our geographical reach expands, developing and maintaining our
    operational systems and infrastructure becomes increasingly
    challenging. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other
    operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or
    become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or
    partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction
    volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these
    transactions or provide these services. We must continuously
    update these systems to support our operations and growth. This
    updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated
    with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing
    ones.


 


    In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure,
    termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing
    agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial
    intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions,
    and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we
    increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect
    to our clients’ systems. In recent years, there has been
    significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and
    clearing houses, which has increased our exposure to operational
    failure, termination or capacity constraints of the particular
    financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our
    ability to find adequate and
    cost-effective
    alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or
    constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market
    participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of
    operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be
    integrated, often on an accelerated basis.


 


    Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial
    institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses,
    and the increased centrality of these entities under proposed
    and potential regulation, increases the risk that an operational
    failure at one institution or entity may cause an
    industry-wide
    operational failure that could materially impact our ability to
    conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint
    could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions,
    service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our
    businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our
    clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our
    businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.


 


    Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,
    our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
    disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses
    and the communities in which we are located. This may include a
    disruption involving electrical, communications, internet,
    transportation or other services used by us or third parties
    with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a
    result of events that affect only our buildings or the buildings
    of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader
    impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those
    buildings are located.





    35








Table of Contents





    Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including
    the New York metropolitan area, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong,
    Tokyo and Bangalore, work in close proximity to one another, in
    one or more buildings. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain
    business continuity, given that our headquarters and the largest
    concentration of our employees are in the New York metropolitan
    area, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a
    catastrophic event impacting our New York metropolitan area
    offices could very negatively affect our business. If a
    disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that
    location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or
    travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact
    with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to
    successfully implement contingency plans that depend on
    communication or travel.


 


    Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
    transmission of confidential and other information in our
    computer systems and networks. Although we take protective
    measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,
    our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to
    unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious
    code and other events that could have a security impact. If one
    or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize
    our or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential
    and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted
    through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
    interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, our
    counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which
    could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We
    may be required to expend significant additional resources to
    modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate
    vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to
    litigation and financial losses that are either not insured
    against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by
    us.


 


    We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and
    proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We
    have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service
    providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop
    secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be
    unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our
    clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other
    third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third
    parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the
    confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or
    mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information
    being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service
    provider, counterparty or other third party could result in
    legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.


 



    Conflicts of
    interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify
    and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our
    businesses.


 


    As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client
    base, we increasingly must address potential conflicts of
    interest, including situations where our services to a
    particular client or our own investments or other interests
    conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of
    another client, as well as situations where one or more of our
    businesses have access to material
    non-public
    information that may not be shared with other businesses within
    the firm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity
    with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. In
    addition, our status as a bank holding company subjects us to
    heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the
    Federal Reserve Board with respect to transactions between GS
    Bank USA and entities that are or could be seen as affiliates of
    ours.


 


    We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to
    identify and address conflicts of interest, including those
    designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among
    our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing
    with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our
    reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be
    damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into
    transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be
    affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and deal
    appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential
    or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or
    regulatory enforcement actions.

    Substantial
    legal liability or significant regulatory action against us
    could have material adverse financial effects or cause us
    significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously
    harm our business prospects.


 


    We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the
    volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial
    institutions remain high. See “Legal Proceedings” in
    Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are
    involved. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers
    and clients increase in a market downturn and that
    employment-related claims increase in periods when we have
    reduced the total number of employees.


 


    There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
    fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
    industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee
    misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or
    prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to
    prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be
    effective in all cases.


 



    The growth of
    electronic trading and the introduction of new trading
    technology may adversely affect our business and may increase
    competition.


 


    Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The
    growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new
    technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with
    new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are
    increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems
    and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears
    that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue
    and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading
    systems compete with our trading businesses, including our
    exchange-based
    market-making
    businesses, and we may experience continued competitive
    pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased
    use by our clients of
    low-cost
    electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to
    trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and
    spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade
    directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of
    their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. We
    have invested significant resources into the development of
    electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but
    there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these
    systems will yield an adequate return on our investment,
    particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from
    electronic trades.


 



    Our
    commodities activities, particularly our power generation
    interests and our physical commodities businesses, subject us to
    extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and
    environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us
    to significant liabilities and costs.


 


    We engage in, or invest in entities that engage in, the
    production, storage, transportation, marketing and trading of
    numerous commodities, including crude oil, oil products, natural
    gas, electric power, agricultural products, natural gas, metals
    (base and precious), minerals (including uranium), emission
    credits, coal, freight, liquefied natural gas and related
    products and indices. These activities subject us to extensive
    and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental and
    other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including
    environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others,
    air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of
    hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and
    health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns
    can lead to additional regulation that may increase the
    operating costs and profitability of our investments.


 


    We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or
    future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related
    businesses and investments, particularly electric power
    generation, transportation and storage of physical commodities
    and wholesale sales and trading of electricity and natural gas.
    Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to
    commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring,
    installation of pollution control equipment, renovation of
    storage

    facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and
    carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of,
    permits and licenses. Our commodities-related activities are
    also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events,
    many of which are outside of our control, including breakdown or
    failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines,
    transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or
    processes or other mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills
    or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected
    levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, natural
    disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition,
    we rely on third party suppliers or service providers to perform
    their contractual obligations and any failure on their part,
    including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable
    prices or to safely transport or store commodities could
    adversely affect our business. In addition, we may not be able
    to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the
    insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.


 


    The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from
    performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our
    operations or financial results and may result in litigation,
    regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.


 



    In conducting
    our businesses around the world, we are subject to political,
    economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent
    in operating in many countries.


 


    In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to risks of possible
    nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital
    controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
    actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of
    terrorism. In many countries, the laws and regulations
    applicable to the securities and financial services industries
    and many of the transactions in which we are involved are
    uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to
    determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market.
    Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in
    compliance with the application of local laws in a particular
    market or our failure to develop effective working relationships
    with local regulators could have a significant and negative
    effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our
    reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk
    that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable
    in all cases.


 


    Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into
    new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets,
    and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging market
    countries have experienced severe economic and financial
    disruptions, including significant devaluations of their
    currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt,
    capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative
    growth rates in their economies, as well as military activity or
    acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of these
    conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and
    increased volatility in financial markets generally.


 



    We may incur
    losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events,
    including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or
    natural disasters.


 


    The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including
    the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency
    (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),
    terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic
    and financial disruptions, could lead to operational
    difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair
    our ability to manage our businesses, and could expose our
    insurance businesses to significant losses.
