Item 1A.  

    
    Risk
    Factors





 


    Dover’s business, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including
    but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could
    cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results
    or from anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying
    additional risk factors and important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see
    the discussion in “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING
    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” included in this Annual Report
    on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Cyclical
    Economic Conditions May Affect the Company’s Financial
    Performance


 


    A meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue, most notably
    those from the A&M group in the Technologies segment and the
    Components group in the Electronics segment, is derived from
    companies which serve the global electronics markets, that are
    subject to somewhat unpredictable short-term business cycles. As
    a result, the revenue and operating performance of these
    companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of
    their revenue and operating performance in other periods, and
    could have a material impact on Dover’s consolidated
    financial position.


 


    The Oil and Gas group in the Resources segment has a certain
    level of risk related to the volatility of energy prices
    although overall demand is more directly related to depletion
    rates and rig counts.


 


    In addition, Dover is subject to substantially the same risk
    factors as other
    U.S.-based
    industrial manufacturers. However, except as noted above, the
    structure of Dover and the many different markets its companies
    serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors
    will materially impact Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.
