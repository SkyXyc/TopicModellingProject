ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K. These risks and other factors may affect forward-looking statements, including those in this document or made by the Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, there could be a material impact on the Company.Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on our investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm our business. Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, in the United States and Japan and elsewhere. Global capital markets experienced extreme disruption during the latter part of 2008 and much of 2009 driven by concerns with overall economic conditions originating largely from the U.S. mortgage and housing market. Economic risks continued to rise as business and consumer confidence declined amid concerns with the availability and cost of credit, the weak U.S. mortgage market, and a declining real estate market in the United States. Rising energy costs, volatile commodity prices, increasing unemployment and geopolitical issues further contributed to the extreme volatility of this period. This financial market volatility resulted in a dramatic reduction in the availability of credit and substantially increased the cost of borrowing.As the financial crisis continued, beginning in early 2010, the risk of sovereign defaults or restructurings, combined with decreased valuations and reduced liquidity for certain entities in the European banking sector, negatively impacted securities issued by these entities. Although recent actions by the European Central Bank (ECB) and other Euro-wide institutions have helped reduce many of the major risk fears of investors, these developments continue to impact the market for financial products. Many European economies are projected to remain in recession in 2013 as the austerity programs required to appease markets start to take hold. As we hold in our investment portfolio a significant amount of fixed maturity and perpetual securities, including a large portion issued by banks and financial institutions, sovereigns and other corporate borrowers based throughout Europe, our financial condition could be adversely affected by these developments. A continuation or worsening of the European crisis could adversely affect our capital position and our overall profitability. Recessionary pressures could result in an increase in credit losses due to severe price declines of our portfolio, default in payment of interest, and credit rating downgrades.  We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, dividends on our common stock, interest on our debt, and liabilities. For a further description of our liquidity needs, including maturing indebtedness, see Item 7 of this Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity. In the event our current resources do not meet our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. Our access to additional funding will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit to the financial services industry and our credit rating. Should investor concern with the European sovereign crisis increase overall market volatility and reduce access to market financing, we could be severely impacted given our large exposure to European securities in our investment portfolio. There is a possibility that lenders or debt investors may develop a negative perception of us if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn or there are further adverse economic trends in the United States or Japan. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us.Broad economic factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. This adverse effect could be particularly significant for companies such as ours that distribute supplemental, discretionary insurance products primarily through the worksite in the event that economic conditions result in a decrease in the number of new hires and total employees. Adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to be less inclined to purchase supplemental insurance coverage or to decide to cancel or modify existing insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our premium revenue, results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the United States, Japan and other countries, which may have an adverse effect on us, in part because we are dependent upon customer behavior and spending. 11The effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally, or on us specifically, is difficult to determine at this time.In response to the severity of the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and concern about financial institutions' viability, numerous regulatory and governmental actions have been taken or proposed. In the United States, this includes aggressive expansionary monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, including conventional measures such as reducing the Federal Funds rate to near zero, and less conventional measures such as expanding the eligible collateral for loans and multiple rounds of quantitative easing. The result of the actions of the Federal Reserve has been to keep interest rates, as measured by the U.S. Treasury curve and other relevant market rates, at very low levels for an extended period of time in an attempt to stimulate the economy. As many of these steps by the Federal Reserve are unprecedented, considerable risks exist surrounding the amount of monetary stimulus provided. These risks could include heightened inflation, increased volatility of interest rates, significantly higher interest rates, and overall increased volatility in the fair value of investment securities. These factors could negatively impact our business by reducing the value of our existing portfolio, negatively impacting our opportunities for new investments as the risk of new credit investments is heightened and market volatility increases, increasing the risk of default in our credit portfolio, and reducing the demand for our products should the broader economy be negatively impacted by withdrawal of monetary stimulus.The ECB has undertaken a series of steps designed to mitigate the effects of the European Sovereign Debt crisis. These steps include reductions in the main lending rate, and introduced a long-term refinancing operation (LTRO). The program provides collateralized three-year low interest loans to financial institutions to provide much needed liquidity to Eurozone financial institutions. During August of 2012, the ECB announced further steps through a program they labeled Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). This program would involve the ECB buying on a potentially unlimited basis government bonds issued in the secondary market by those European sovereign nations requesting official aid from the European Financial Stability Fund.Several European governments have passed resolution regime legislation that provides regulators with expanded powers intended to limit the negative impact of large bank failures and protect depositors and taxpayers from further losses. Some of these powers enable the regulator to impose "burden sharing" upon all providers of capital, including senior unsecured lenders. Burden sharing imposes losses on investments in going-concern issuers as a result of an involuntary change in terms or a reduction in principal or interest. Currently, this legislation is in effect in a few Euro area countries, but it may be adopted across the Euro area in the coming years.Many of these governmental interventions have helped create an environment of extremely low interest rates for an extended period of time. There can be no assurance as to the effect that these governmental actions, other governmental actions taken in the future, or the ceasing of these governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on our competitive position, business and financial condition.Defaults, downgrades, widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities in our investment portfolio may reduce our earnings.We are subject to the risk that the issuers, guarantors, and/or counterparties of fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities we own may default on principal, interest and other payments they owe us. A significant portion of our portfolio represents an unsecured obligation of the issuer. In these cases, many factors can influence the overall creditworthiness of the issuer and ultimately its ability to service and repay our holdings. This can include changes in the global economy, the company's assets, strategy, or management, shifts in the dynamics of the industries in which they compete, their access to additional funding, and the overall health of the credit markets. Factors unique to our securities including contractual protections such as financial covenants or relative position in the issuer's capital structure also influence the value of our holdings.   Most of our holdings carry a rating by one or more of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs, or “rating agencies”). Any change in the rating agencies' approach to evaluating credit and assigning an opinion could negatively impact the fair value of our portfolio. We also employ a team of credit analysts globally to monitor the creditworthiness of the issuers in our portfolio. Any credit-related declines in the fair value of positions held in our portfolio we believe are not temporary in nature will negatively impact our net income through impairment and other credit related losses.We are also subject to the risk that any collateral providing credit enhancement to our positions could deteriorate. These instruments include loan-backed securities such as: collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and mortgage-backed 12securities (MBS), where the underlying collateral notes may default on principal, interest, or other payments, causing an adverse change in cash flows to the positions held in our investment portfolio. Our portfolio includes holdings of perpetual securities. Most of these are issued by global banks and financial institutions. Following the financial crisis, rating agencies have been reviewing and modifying the rating criteria for financial institutions. This has caused multiple downgrades of many bank and financial issuers, but perpetual securities have been more negatively impacted as their lower position in the capital structure represents relatively more risk than other more senior obligations of the issuer. Further downgrades of issuers of securities we own will have a negative impact on our portfolio and could reduce our earnings.We are exposed to sovereign credit risk through instruments issued directly by governments and government entities as well as banks and other institutions that rely in part on the strength of the underlying government for their credit quality. Many governments, especially in Europe, have been subject to rating downgrades due to reduced economic activity, increased fiscal spending, and investment needed to support banks or other systematically important entities. Further downgrades will have a negative impact on our portfolio and could reduce our earnings.In addition to our exposure to the underlying credit strength of various issuers of fixed maturity and perpetual securities, we are also exposed to credit spreads, primarily related to market pricing and variability of future cash flows associated with credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads could reduce the value of our existing portfolio and create unrealized losses on our investment portfolio. This could, however, increase the net investment income on new credit investments. Conversely, a tightening of credit spreads could increase the value of our existing portfolio and create unrealized gains on our investment portfolio. This could reduce the net investment income available to us on new credit investments. Increased market volatility also makes it difficult to value certain of our investment holdings (see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis).For more information regarding credit risk, see the Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Credit Risk subsection of Item 7 of this Form 10-K (Management's Discussion and Analysis).The impairment of other financial institutions' creditworthiness could adversely affect us.We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker dealers, commercial banks and other institutions. Additionally, one of the largest sector concentrations in our investment portfolio is banks and financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of the obligor or the counterparty. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Further, we have agreements with various financial institutions for the distribution of our insurance products. For example, at December 31, 2012, we had agreements with 372 banks to market Aflac's products in Japan. Sales through these banks represented 45.6% of Aflac Japan's new annualized premium sales in 2012. Any material adverse effect on these or other financial institutions could also have an adverse effect on our sales.We are subject to certain risks as a result of our investments in perpetual securities.As of December 31, 2012, we held $4.2 billion of perpetual securities, at amortized cost, which represented 3.8% of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities. Perpetual securities have characteristics of both debt and equity instruments. These securities do not have a stated maturity date, but generally have a stated interest coupon that was fixed at the time of issuance but then changes to a floating rated security at some predetermined date. Most perpetual securities have call features including the ability of the issuer to retire the debt at par upon the change to a floating rate security. Generally, the mechanics of the floating rate change were intended at the time of issuance to incent the borrower to call the instrument, having the effect of creating an expected economic maturity date. We believe many of the issuers of our perpetual securities will call the instruments upon a change in payment structure but there are no assurances the issuers will do so. Further, there can be no assurance the issuers will have the ability to repay the outstanding principal amount. Perpetual securities may contain provisions allowing the borrower to defer paying interest for a time. In some cases, we have contractual provisions that stipulate any deferred interest payment accumulates for our benefit and must be paid in the future. There is no assurance such issuers will not choose to defer making payments or will be able to honor a cumulative deferral feature.There is also a risk that the accounting for these perpetual securities could change in a manner that would have an adverse impact on the reporting for these securities. At the date of filing this Form 10-K, the SEC does not object to the 13use of a debt impairment model for impairment recognition of these securities as long as there is no significant deterioration in the credit condition of the perpetual securities. The debt impairment model allows the holder to consider whether or not interest and principal payments will be received in accordance with contractual terms and the holder's intent and ability to hold the perpetual security until there is a recovery in value. The equity impairment model, by contrast, looks at the length of time a security's fair value has been below its cost basis and the percentage decline to determine whether an impairment should be recorded, without consideration to the holder's intent and ability to hold the security until recovery in value. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are also working on the financial instruments project which addresses classification and measurement, impairment and hedging. The IASB exposed for comment limited amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 regarding classification and measurement in November 2012. In December 2012, the FASB issued an exposure draft proposing a new impairment model. The revisions will cause investment losses to be recognized sooner and will result in changes in the classification and measurement of certain types of investments. The ultimate outcome and timing of these events is uncertain at this time. The adoption of IFRS and/or the effects of accounting standards convergence could significantly alter the presentation of our financial position and results of operations in our financial statements. The outcome and timing of this project is uncertain but could result in changes to the current accounting model for perpetual securities, including the possible recognition of some or all of unrealized losses through earnings rather than equity. Although this change would not affect total shareholders' equity as the unrealized loss is already recorded in shareholders' equity, it would reduce net income in the period the change occurred and in future periods. Statutory accounting principles account for these securities using the debt model. Additionally, these securities are carried at amortized cost for statutory reporting purposes, with the exception of any securities that are assigned the lowest NAIC rating (i.e. NAIC 6) or are determined to be impaired (i.e. the issuer will not be able to pay interest and principal as contractually due). Should the statutory accounting requirements change regarding the method of recognizing impairments or the values at which the securities should be carried in the financial statements, it could adversely affect our statutory capital, depending upon the changes adopted.The valuation of our investments and derivatives includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.The vast majority of our financial instruments are subject to the fair value classification provisions under GAAP, which specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuations, and relates to our investment securities classified as available for sale in our investment portfolio, which comprised $61.6 billion (52%) of our total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2012. In accordance with GAAP, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1). It gives the next priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities and other inputs that can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2). The lowest priority represents unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entity's understanding about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3).  An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation.At December 31, 2012, approximately 20%, 75% and 5% of our total available-for-sale securities represented Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 securities, respectively. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the securities in our investment portfolio, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In addition, prices provided by independent pricing services and independent broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security. In such cases, more securities may be transferred to Level 3 from Levels 1 and 2. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Further, the Company has entered into an agreement with an independent third party to value certain securities within our investment portfolio, primarily perpetual and privately issued holdings. These securities are currently being valued using a discounted cash flow pricing model and are classified as Level 2. We expect to receive valuation information from the third party to be evaluated by management by the end of the first quarter of 2013. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact of this new valuation approach. Changes in value may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.14For further discussion on investment and derivative valuations, see Notes 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.The determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on significant valuation judgments and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.The majority of our investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model.  Our debt impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investments. The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. An investment in a fixed maturity or perpetual security is impaired if the fair value falls below book value.  We regularly review our entire investment portfolio for declines in value.  For our fixed maturity and perpetual securities reported in the available-for-sale portfolio, we report the investments at fair value in the statement of financial condition and record any unrealized gain or loss in the value of the asset in accumulated other comprehensive income. For our held-to-maturity portfolio, we report the investments at amortized cost. The determination of whether an impairment in value is other than temporary is based largely on our evaluation of the issuer's creditworthiness. Our team of experienced credit professionals must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. Factors that may influence this include the overall level of interest rates, credit spreads, the credit quality of the underlying issuer, and other factors. If we determine it is unlikely we will recover our book value of the instrument prior to our disposal of the security, we will reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and recognize any associated impairment loss in our consolidated statement of earnings.Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model focuses on the severity of a security's decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer.Our management updates its evaluations regularly as conditions change and as new information becomes available and reflects impairment losses in the Company's income statement when considered necessary. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect our profits.We attempt to match the duration of our assets with our liabilities and for Aflac Japan this can be very challenging due to the fact that the Japan investment marketplace is not very broad or deep. Historically, the Company has been heavily focused on investing cash flows in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), and utilizing private placement and perpetual securities to extend the duration of the investment portfolio. The investment in private placements and perpetual securities has led to increased risks associated with illiquidity. Starting in the third quarter of 2012, the Company augmented its investment strategy to include U.S. securities which are then hedged back to yen. This strategy is meant to improve diversification, income yields and liquidity. As of December 31, 2012, the Company held approximately $7.0 billion in U.S. fixed income securities, at amortized cost, and approximately $7.0 billion of notional in foreign currency forwards to hedge the related currency risks. This strategy has led to economic risk associated with the roll-over of the currency forwards which hold tenors that are shorter than the corresponding hedged U.S. securities. This risk can significantly impact the Company's consolidated financial position and earnings.The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular single-issuer or sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.Negative events or developments affecting any particular single issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified. Therefore, the degree of concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular single issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial position. Beginning in 2005, we have generally limited our investment exposures to individual issuers to no more than 5% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory accounting basis, with the exception of obligations of the Japanese and U.S. governments. However, existing investment exposures that exceeded 5% of TAC at the time this guidance was adopted, or exposures that may exceed this threshold from time to time through merger and consolidation activity, are not automatically reduced through sales of the issuers' securities but rather are reduced over time consistent with our investment policy. At December 31, 2012, with the 15exception of investments in JGBs, we did not have any single-issuer investments that exceeded the upper bound of our investment risk exposure limits, which is considered to be 10% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a U.S. statutory accounting basis. At December 31, 2012, approximately 18% of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities, on an amortized cost basis, was in the bank and financial institution sector. For further details on the concentrations within our investment portfolios see the Analysis of Financial Condition section of MD&A in this report.Our concentration of business in Japan poses risks to our operations.Our operations in Japan, including realized gains and losses on Aflac Japan's investment portfolio, accounted for 77% of our total revenues for 2012, compared with 75% in 2011 and 2010. The Japanese operations accounted for 87% of our total assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Bank of Japan's January 2013 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that Japan's economic activity as of the end of 2012 remains relatively weak. The report projected that Japan's economy is expected to level off more or less for the time being, and thereafter, it will return to a moderate recovery path as domestic demand remains resilient and overseas economies gradually emerge from the deceleration phase. Exports are expected to decrease at a reduced pace for the time being and start picking up thereafter, housing investment is expected to continue to generally increase, public investment is expected to continue trending upward, and private consumption is expected to remain resilient.Further, because of the concentration of our business in Japan and our need for long-dated yen denominated assets, we have a substantial concentration of JGBs in our investment portfolio. As such we have material exposure to the Japanese economy, geo-political climate, political regime, and other elements that generally determine a country's creditworthiness.  We seek to match the investment currency and interest rate risk to our yen liabilities. The low level of interest rates available on yen securities has a negative effect on our overall net investment income. A large portion of the cash available for reinvestment each year is deployed in yen-denominated instruments and subject to the low level of yen interest rates.Any potential deterioration in Japan's credit quality, market access, the overall economy of Japan, or Japanese market volatility could adversely impact the business of Aflac Japan and our related results of operations and financial condition. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. Aflac Japan's premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. Any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. In addition, the weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. Foreign currency translation also impacts the computation of our risk-based capital ratio because Aflac Japan is consolidated in our U.S. statutory filings due to its status as a branch. Our required capital, as determined by the application of risk factors to our assets and liabilities, is proportionately more sensitive to changes in the exchange rate than our total adjusted capital. As a result, when the yen strengthens relative to the dollar, our risk-based capital ratio is suppressed. We engage in certain foreign currency hedging activities for the purpose of hedging the yen exposure to our net investment in our branch operations in Japan.  These hedging activities are limited in scope and we cannot provide assurance that these activities will be effective. Additionally, we are exposed to economic currency risk when yen cash flows are converted into dollars, resulting in an increase or decrease in our earnings when exchange gains or losses are realized. This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done on an annual basis. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. For more information regarding foreign currency risk, see the Currency Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.16For more information regarding foreign currency risk, see the Currency Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.We are subject to various risks associated with increased derivative activities.We use derivative instruments to mitigate various risks associated with our investment portfolio and notes payable.  We enter into a variety of agreements involving assorted instruments including forward contracts, interest rate and currency swaps. To provide additional alternatives to increase our overall portfolio yield while managing our overall currency risk, in the third quarter of 2012, we began investing most of the investable cash flow generated by Aflac Japan into U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade public bonds and hedging these bonds to yen through the use of currency forward contracts. At December 31, 2012, we were hedging approximately $7.0 billion of notional through this program. The derivative forward contracts are of a shorter maturity than the hedged bonds which creates roll-over risks within the hedging program. Due to changes in market environments, there is a risk the hedges become ineffective and lose the corresponding hedge accounting treatment. Further, the Company only holds a certain number of executed International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements so our ability to diversify derivative counterparties is currently limited. At December 31, 2012, we held interest rate and cross-currency swaps of $1.3 billion notional associated with our notes payable, and currency forwards of approximately $7.0 billion notional associated with the Company's fair value hedging program. As such, the Company's increased use of derivatives has increased financial exposures to our current derivative counterparties. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments our hedges of the risks will be ineffective. Further, if markets move negatively to our hedging position, the Company may be required to post collateral to support the derivative contracts and/or pay cash to settle the contracts at maturity which could strain the Company's liquidity.  All of these risks could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.We operate in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes.We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative reform, marketing practices and changes to health care and health insurance delivery. These factors require us to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. We also face the potential of competition from existing or new companies in the United States and Japan that have not historically been active in the supplemental health insurance industry. Failure to anticipate market trends and/or to differentiate our products and services can affect our ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business.We are exposed to significant interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in Japan and the United States during recent years, have reduced the level of investment income earned by the Company. Our overall level of investment income will be negatively impacted if a low-interest-rate environment persists. While we generally seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that reflects the cash flow and duration characteristics of the liabilities it supports, we may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the ability to invest future cash flows to support the interest rate assumption made at the time our products were priced and the related reserving assumptions were established. A rise in interest rates could improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds that we reinvest. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued. Further, changes in interest rates have direct impacts on the values of fixed securities in our investment portfolio; however, they do not have direct impact on the related valuation of the corresponding liabilities.We also have exposure to interest rates related to the value of the substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Prolonged periods of low interest rates, as have been experienced in recent years, heighten the risk of future increases in interest rates because of an increasing proportion of our investment portfolio includes investments that bear low rates of return. A rise in interest rates could increase the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could decrease the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. While we generally invest our assets to match the duration and cash flow characteristics of our policy liabilities, and therefore would not expect to realize most of these gains or losses, our risk is that unforeseen events or economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control, reduce the effectiveness of this strategy and 17either cause us to dispose of some or all of these investments prior to their maturity, or cause the issuers of these securities to default, both of which could result in our having to recognize such gains or losses.Rising interest rates also negatively impact the solvency margin ratio since unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment portfolio are included in the calculation. While we closely monitor the solvency margin ratio and have taken steps to reduce the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's available-for-sale portfolio to increases in interest rates, there is no assurance that these measures will be fully effective, particularly for sharp increases in interest rates.Significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, changes in unrealized positions, and liquidity.For more information regarding interest rate risk, see the Interest Rate Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.If future policy benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various assumptions and estimates, including premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy; the timing, frequency and severity of the events covered by the insurance policy; and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with a portion of our net cash flow from operations. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove inadequate. As a result, we would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which we determine such a shortfall exists, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a holding company, the Parent Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.The Parent Company is a holding company and has no direct operations or significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to insurance regulations that impose certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. In addition, the FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders.The ability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could also be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on Aflac's capitalization level. Any inability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that the earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to us to enable us to operate.Extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth.Aflac's insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FSA and Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and the U.S. Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with another regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is also a risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement 18authority's interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our detriment. In addition, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. The primary purpose of insurance company regulatory supervision is the protection of insurance policyholders, rather than investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and regulation cover, among other things: •standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof•standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency margins, including risk-based capital measures•restrictions on, limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including management fee arrangements•restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments•restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations•limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay or foreign profits that can be repatriated•the existence and licensing status of a company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business•certain required methods of accounting•reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes•assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies•administrative practices requirements•imposition of fines and other sanctionsGovernmental authorities periodically re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. New federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the President. For example, the PPACA, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes, directed toward major medical health insurance coverage which Aflac does not offer, have already begun and will continue to be phased in over the next several years. We believe that the PPACA, as enacted, does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations. In 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council). The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including potentially insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Board), including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such company’s ability to enter into merger transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. In April 2012, the Council released a final rule describing the general process the Council will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and 19crop insurance. The director of the Federal Insurance Office has the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement. We believe that Aflac wouldnot likely be considered a company that would pose a systemic risk to the financial stability of the United States. However,at the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act willhave on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations.Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates.Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks deteriorate or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education for our existing network. Competition exists for sales associates with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial rating. An inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates could have a material adverse effect on sales and our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales associates are independent contractors and may sell products of our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do, these sales associates may concentrate their efforts on selling our competitors' products instead of ours.Any decrease in our financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position.Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on the business of insurance companies. On an ongoing basis NRSROs review the financial performance and condition of insurers and may downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital; a change in a rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer's investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management; or other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. In addition to financial strength ratings, various NRSROs also publish ratings on our debt. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our ability to access liquidity in the debt markets. Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, and causing termination of certain derivative agreements.In view of the difficulties experienced in the last several years by many financial institutions, including in the insurance industry, the NRSROs have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, increased the frequency and scope of their reviews, requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held, and, in certain cases, have increased the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels.A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention, sales, competitiveness and the marketability of our products which could negatively impact our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.  Additionally, sales through the bank channel in Japan could be adversely affected as a result of their reliance and sensitivity to ratings levels.We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO.20The success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology.Our business depends in large part on our technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders, sales associates, and brokers, and our business strategy involves providing customers with easy-to-use products to meet their needs and ensuring employees have the technology in place to support those needs. Some of our information technology systems and software are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards (including adequate business continuity procedures). We are in a continual state of upgrading and enhancing our business systems; however, these changes are always challenging in our complex integrated environment. Our success is dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient manner. Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.We depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers, or in the misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information. Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such  systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the United States and Japan, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The FASB and IASB have announced their commitment to achieving a single set of high-quality global accounting standards, and the SEC continues to encourage the convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS in order to narrow the differences between the two sets of standards. In 2010, the SEC announced a work plan, the results of which would aid the Commission in its evaluation of the impact that the use of IFRS by U.S. companies would have on the U.S. securities market. Included in this work plan is consideration of IFRS, as it exists today and after the completion of various convergence projects currently underway between U.S. and international accounting standards-setters. In October 2010, the SEC issued its first progress report on the work plan, summarizing the objectives as well as the efforts and preliminary observations as of that time. In November 2011, the SEC released two staff papers. The papers help to address whether IFRS has developed sufficiently enough to be used in the United States. These papers were designed to aid the SEC in determining whether or not to incorporate IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system. For the insurance industry, key components of the convergence between U.S. GAAP and IFRS have yet to be clarified. In 2012, the SEC issued the final report which stated that adopting IFRS would present challenges and that the majority of the U.S. capital market participants did not support adopting IFRS. However, the report also stated there was significant support for other methods of incorporating IFRS through endorsement into U.S. GAAP. The FASB and IASB are currently working on a joint insurance contracts project that will change the way insurance liabilities are determined and reported. The insurance contracts exposure draft is expected to be released in the second quarter of 2013. The FASB and IASB are also working on the financial instruments project, which addresses classification and measurement, impairment and hedging. The IASB exposed for comment limited amendments to IFRS 9 regarding classification and measurement in November 2012. In December 2012, the FASB issued an exposure draft proposing a new impairment model. The revisions will cause investment losses to be recognized sooner and will result in changes in the classification and measurement of certain types of investments. The ultimate outcome and timing of these events are uncertain at this time. The adoption of IFRS 21and/or the effects of accounting standards convergence could significantly alter the presentation of our financial position and results of operations in our financial statements.See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a discussion of recent changes in accounting standards and those that are pending adoption. If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations).Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. The U.S. Congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to our business. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that are housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, including: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief.We face risks related to litigation.We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments against us or because of changes in our operations that could result from litigation.Managing key executive succession is critical to our success.We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these plans cannot guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to us, and our operations could be adversely affected if they are not. Catastrophic events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and acts of terrorism. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Certain events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and man-made catastrophes could cause substantial damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man−made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year 22and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition, as well as affect our ability to write new business. Although the impact of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and its related events in Japan have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations, actual claims may vary from our estimates and may further negatively impact our financial results. We will continue to monitor the business and economic conditions in Japan in light of these events and will continue to update our assessment of the natural disaster impact on our results of operations.Any event, including one external to our operations, could damage our reputation.Because insurance products are intangible, we rely to a large extent on consumer trust in our business. The perception of financial weakness could create doubt regarding our ability to honor the commitments we have made to our policyholders. Maintaining our stature as a responsible corporate citizen, which helps support the strength of our unique brand, is critical to our reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect us. We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which include:•any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principle•failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees•a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting•failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements•failure of corporate governance policies and proceduresITEM 1B
