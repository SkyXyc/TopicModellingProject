ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSAmong the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:Industry Risks:Pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:•Capacity utilization- Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry.•Competition- All of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. Additionally, in Agricultural Products, competition includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredient, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds, and intellectual property regarding production or use of pesticides.  Increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue.•Changes in our customer base- Our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. Our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk.•Climatic conditions- Our Agricultural Products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. The nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.•Changing regulatory environment- Changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, Brazil, China and the European Union, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so.  Our Agricultural Products business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. In the European Union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. The fundamental principle behind the REACH regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system.•Climate change regulation- Changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain Industrial Chemicals operations in the United States, to significant additional costs or limits on operations.•Raw materials and energy costs- Our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. We may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in the costs of raw materials or energy.•Supply arrangements and production hazards- Certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. While we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. We increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, especially in Agricultural Products. An inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. Our facilities and those of our key contract manufacturers are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business.17Table of Contents•Economic and political change- Our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the United States or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation,  and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control.•Foreign operations- The Company's foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property.  In Brazil, our customers face a combination of economic factors that could result in cash flow pressures that lead to slower payments.•Market access risk- Our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. In certain Agricultural Products segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. Where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios.•Business disruptions- Our business could be adversely affected by information technology systems outages or intrusions, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages.•Operational Risks- The Company's manufacturing operations inherently entail hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as leaks, ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the Company's ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. •Litigation and environmental risks- Current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate.•Hazardous materials- We manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. While we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us.•Environmental Compliance- The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The Company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Technology Risks:•Our ability to compete successfully, particularly in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals, depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. •Failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position.Financial Risks:•While we have seen signs of recovery in global economic activity and in worldwide credit markets since the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, a general slowdown in economic activity caused by an economic recession could adversely affect our business. A worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to fully perform their commitments to us. •We are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. We are particularly sensitive to the euro, the Brazilian real and the Chinese yuan. To a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the Mexican peso, the Argentine peso, the British pound sterling and several Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen.•We have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.•Obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. To the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.18Table of ContentsITEM 1B
