Item 1A — Risk Factors’’ below for a discussion of certain additional business risks specific to our government contracts.


As is common in the U.S. defense industry, we are subject to business risks, including changes in the U.S. Government’s procurement policies (such as greater emphasis on competitive procurement), governmental appropriations, national defense policies or regulations, service modernization plans, and availability of funds. A reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us or the incurrence of substantial contract cost overruns could materially adversely affect our business.


Certain of our sales are under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements directly between the U.S. Government and allied foreign governments. In such cases, because we serve only as the supplier, we do not have unilateral control over the terms of the agreements. These contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with these laws and regulations. Investigations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, disallowance of certain costs, or fines and penalties. Certain of our sales are direct commercial sales to allied foreign governments. These sales are subject to U.S. Government approval and licensing under the Arms Export Control Act. Legal restrictions on sales of sensitive U.S. technology also limit the extent to which we can sell our products to allied foreign governme
nts or private parties.


Environmental Matters


Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements. 


We have also assessed the risk of environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification, either from the sellers of those acquired businesses or through pollution liability insurance. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. We believe our current expenditures will allow us to continue to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe that after considering recorded liabilities, there are no environmental loss contingencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our consolid
ated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


Certain Acquired Pension Plans


In connection with our acquisition of ten business units from Lockheed Martin and the formation of L-3 in 1997, we assumed certain defined benefit pension plan liabilities for present and former employees and retirees of certain of these businesses from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin had previously received a letter from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) indicating that the pension plans of two of these businesses were under funded using the PBGC’s actuarial assumptions (Subject Plans).


With respect to the Subject Plans, Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement (Lockheed Martin Commitment) with L-3 and the PBGC dated as of April 30, 1997. The terms and conditions of the Lockheed Martin Commitment include a commitment by Lockheed Martin to the PBGC to, under certain circumstances, assume sponsorship of the Subject Plans or provide another form of financial support for the Subject Plans. The Lockheed Martin Commitment will continue until the Subject Plans are no longer under funded on a PBGC basis for two consecutive years, or immediately if we achieve investment grade credit ratings on all of our outstanding debt.

Table of Contents

If Lockheed Martin did assume sponsorship of the Subject Plans, it would be primarily liable for the costs associated with funding the Subject Plans or any costs associated with the termination of the Subject Plans. The terms and conditions of the Lockheed Martin Commitment would require us to reimburse Lockheed Martin for these costs. Lockheed Martin has not assumed sponsorship or provided another form of financial support for the Subject Plans.


We believe we have performed our obligations under the Lockheed Martin Commitment and have not received any communications from the PBGC concerning actions that the PBGC contemplates taking in respect of the Subject Plans.


For the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed $8 million to the Subject Plans. For subsequent years, our funding requirements will depend upon prevailing interest rates, return on pension plan assets and underlying actuarial assumptions. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $238 million and the aggregate plan assets were $222 million for the Subject Plans. At December 31, 2007, we have recorded a liability of $16 million for the under funded status of the Subject Plans.


Employees


As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately 64,600 full-time and part-time employees, 83% of whom were located in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 18% are covered by 91 separate collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The success of our business is primarily dependent upon the knowledge of our employees and on the management, contracting, engineering and technical skills of our employees. In addition, our ability to grow our businesses, obtain additional orders for our products and services and to satisfy contractual obligations under certain of our existing revenue arrangements is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.


L-3 Holdings Obligations


The only obligations of L-3 Holdings at December 31, 2007 are: (1) its 3% Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES) due 2035, which were issued by L-3 Holdings on July 29, 2005, (2) its guarantee of borrowings under the senior credit facility of L-3 Communications and (3) its guarantee of other contractual obligations of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries. L-3 Holdings’ obligations relating to the CODES have been jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L-3 Communications and certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. In order to generate the funds necessary to repurchase common stock and pay dividends declared and principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness, if any, L-3 Holdings relies on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries or it must raise funds in public or private equity or debt offerings.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors


You should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including ‘‘Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’ Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could in turn materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.


Our contracts (revenue arrangements) with U.S. Government customers entail certain risks.


A decline in or a redirection of the U.S. defense budget could result in a material decrease in our sales, earnings and cash flows.


Our government contracts are primarily dependent upon the U.S. defense budget. We, as most U.S. defense contractors, have benefited from the upward trend in overall DoD spending over recent years, including supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The President’s DoD base defense budget request, for the government’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, excluding a fiscal year 2009 GWOT supplemental request, indicates continued growth over fiscal year 2008. However, the future DoD budgets could be negatively affected by several factors, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Government’s budget deficits, U.S. national security strategies, geopolitical events, a change in spending priorities and the costs of sustaining the U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which could cause the DoD budget to remain unchanged or to decline. A significant decline 
in or redirection of U.S. military expenditures in the future could result in a material decrease to our sales, earnings and cash flows. The loss or significant reduction in government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a material decrease to our future sales, earnings and cash flows. U.S. Government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the amount of necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years.


We rely predominantly on sales to U.S. Government entities, and the loss of a significant number of our contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.


Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts (revenue arrangements) with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2,000 contracts (revenue arrangements) with individual estimated contract values in excess of $1 million. Approximately 80%, or $11 billion, of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were made directly or indirectly to U.S. Government agencies, including the DoD. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our largest contract was the Linguist Contract and it represented 5% of our sales, and aggregate sales from our five largest contracts amounted to $2.2 billion, or 16% of our sales. On December 9, 2007, the Linguist Contract period of performance was extended to Ma
rch 8, 2008. In addition, as discussed above under ‘‘Major Customers,’’ INSCOM made an award of the follow-on contract to another service provider.

16




Table of Contents

A substantial majority of our total sales are for products and services under contracts with various agencies and procurement offices of the DoD or with prime contractors to the DoD. Although these various agencies, procurement offices and prime contractors are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, our customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. Because of this concentration of contracts, if a significant number of our DoD contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or cancelled for budgetary, performance or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.


In addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, our backlog and future financial results may be adversely affected by:









• 
curtailment of the U.S. Government’s use of technology or other services and products providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters;










• 
developments in Iraq, Afghanistan or other geopolitical developments that affect demand for our products and services;










• 
our ability to hire and retain personnel to meet increasing demand for our services; and










• 
technological developments that impact purchasing decisions or our competitive position.



Our government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification. If a termination right is exercised by the government, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Companies engaged primarily in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to certain business risks peculiar to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:









• 
suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;










• 
terminate existing contracts;










• 
reduce the value of existing contracts;










• 
audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and










• 
control and potentially prohibit the export of our products.



All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.


U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and various agency Inspectors General routinely audit and investigate our costs and performance on contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be reimbursable under U.S. Government contracts.

We may not be able to win competitively awarded contracts or receive required licenses to export our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.


Our government contracts are subject to competitive bidding. We obtain many of our U.S. Government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts. In addition, awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in our profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the following:









• 
the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;










• 
the substantial time, effort and experience required to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us;










• 
design complexity and rapid technological obsolescence; and










• 
the constant need for design improvement.



In addition to these U.S. Government contract risks, we are required to obtain licenses from U.S. Government agencies to export many of our products and systems. Additionally, we are not permitted to export some of our products. Failure to receive required licenses would eliminate our ability to sell our products outside the United States.


We are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.


We are from time to time subject to governmental investigations relating to our operations. We are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations, including but not limited to, an investigation by the Department of Justice Criminal Antitrust Division regarding information technology services performed for the Air Force. For a discussion of this matter, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements.


We are subject to the risks of current and future legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 


At any given time, we are a defendant in various material legal proceedings and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, claims and assessments that have been asserted against acquired businesses, which we have assumed. Although we maintain insurance policies, we can make no assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. For a discussion of the material litigation to which we are currently a party, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements.


If we are unable to keep pace with rapidly evolving products and service offerings and technological change, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.


The rapid change of technology is a key feature of most of the markets in which our products, services and systems oriented businesses operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Historically, our technology has been developed through customer-funded and internally funded research and development and through certain business acquisitions. We may not be able to continue to maintain comparable levels of research and development or successfully complete such acquisitions. In the past, we have allocated substantial funds to capital expenditures, programs and other investments. This practice will continue to be required in the future. Even so, we may not be able to successfully identify new opportunities and may not have the needed financial resources to develop new products in a timely or cost-effective manner. At th
e same time, products and technologies developed by others may render our products, services and systems obsolete or non-competitive.

Our business acquisition strategy involves risks, and we may not successfully implement our strategy.


We seek to selectively acquire businesses that add new products, technologies, programs or customers to our existing businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we make additional acquisitions, we may not realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions, including cost synergies and improving margins. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, since such additional financing could be restricted or limited by the terms of our debt agreements or due to unfavorable credit market conditions.


The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Possible future business acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and contingent liabilities, each of which could result in an increase to our already significant level of outstanding debt, as well as more restrictive covenants. We consider and execute strategic acquisitions on an ongoing basis and may be evaluating acquisitions or engage in acquisition negotiations at any given time. We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and joint venture transactions, but we have not entered into any agreements with respect to any material transactions at this time. Furthermore, in certain of our business acquisitions we h
ave assumed all claims against and liabilities of the acquired business, including both asserted and unasserted claims and liabilities.


Our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-reimbursable and time-and-material type contracts.


Our sales are transacted using written revenue arrangements, or contracts, which are generally either fixed-price, cost-reimbursable or time-and-material. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see ‘‘Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.’’ For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 51% of our sales were generated from fixed-price type contracts, approximately 30% of our sales were generated from cost-reimbursable type contracts and approximately 19% of our sales were generated from time-and-material type contracts. Substantially all of our cost-reimbursable and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily with the DoD. Substantially all of our sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements, and are included in our fixed-p
rice type contract sales.


On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract.


On a cost-reimbursable type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-reimbursable type and time-and-material type contracts we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.


Additionally, the impact of revisions in profit (loss) estimates for all types of contracts subject to percentage of completion accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories, and in some cases, result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position.

Intense competition in the industries in which our businesses operate could limit our ability to attract and retain customers.


The defense industry and the other industries in which our businesses operate and the market for defense applications is highly competitive. We expect that the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will continue to encourage new competitors to enter the market. We also expect that competition for original equipment manufacturing business will increase due to the continued emergence of merchant suppliers. Our ability to compete for defense contracts depends on a variety of factors, including:









• 
the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies and research and development programs;










• 
our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors at a lower cost;










• 
our historical technical and schedule past performance;










• 
maintaining an effective supplier and vendor base;










• 
our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those who have U.S. Government security clearances; and










• 
the capabilities of our facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the business for which we compete.



Most of our sales are derived from contracts (revenue arrangements) awarded by customers on the basis of negotiations or competitive bids. In some instances, we are the incumbent supplier or have been the sole provider for many years. We refer to our position on such revenue arrangements as ‘‘sole-source’’ contracts. In those instances, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the programs involved, but they can only enter or re-enter the market if the customer chooses to reopen the particular program to competition. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have.


Our significant level of debt and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or ability to incur additional debt.


In prior years we incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our business acquisitions. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $4,550 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt. In addition, we had additional borrowing capacity of $794.5 million at December 31, 2007 available to us under our senior credit facility, after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of $205.5 million. In the future, we may increase our borrowings, subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. The first scheduled maturity of our existing debt will occur on March 9, 2010 for $650 million.


Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to refinance our existing debt depends on our future financial performance. We do not have complete control over our future financial performance because it is subject to economic, political, financial (including credit market conditions), competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting the aerospace and defense industry. It is possible that in the future our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If this situation occurs, we may have to sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms in accordance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements.


Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to us. These consequences may include:









• 
requiring a substantial portion of our net cash flow from operations to be used to pay interest and principal on our debt and therefore be unavailable for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, paying dividends to our shareholders, repurchasing shares of our common stock, research and development and other investments;










• 
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments or other expenditures, which, in each case, may limit our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy;


20




Table of Contents








• 
increasing interest expenses due to higher interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates;










• 
heightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies and products or exploiting business opportunities; and










• 
impacting debt covenants that limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.



Additionally, on December 31, 2007, we had $9,672 million of contractual obligations (including outstanding indebtedness). For a detailed listing of the components of our contractual obligations, see ‘‘Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations’’ on pages 49-50.


Our debt agreements restrict our ability to finance our future operations and, if we are unable to meet our financial ratios, could cause our existing debt to be accelerated.


Our debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:









• 
sell assets;










• 
incur more indebtedness;










• 
repay certain indebtedness;










• 
pay dividends on the common stock of L-3 Holdings;










• 
make certain investments or business acquisitions;










• 
repurchase or redeem capital stock;










• 
make certain capital expenditures;










• 
engage in business mergers or consolidations; and










• 
engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates.



These restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. In addition, some of our debt agreements also require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios, including (1) total consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to total consolidated cash interest expense and (2) total consolidated funded indebtedness less designated cash balances to total consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our ability to comply with these ratios and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these agreements or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants could result in a default under those debt agreements. In the event of any such default, the lenders under those debt agreements could elect to:









• 
declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees to be due and immediately payable;










• 
require us to apply all of our available cash to repay our outstanding senior debt; and










• 
prevent us from making debt service payments on our other debt.



If we are unable to attract and retain key management and personnel, we may become unable to operate our business effectively.


Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management, and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, 

21




Table of Contents


including employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies for members of our management. We face competition for management and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.


Environmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.


Our operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local as well as certain foreign environmental laws and regulations within the countries in which we operate relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations.


New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require us to incur a significant amount of additional costs in the future and could decrease the amount of free cash flow available to us for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development and other investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.


Termination of our backlog of orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.


We currently have a backlog of funded orders, primarily under contracts with the U.S. Government. Our total funded backlog was $9,571 million at December 31, 2007. As described above, the U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or terminate its contracts. Accordingly, most of our backlog could be modified or terminated by the U.S. Government, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.


Our sales to certain foreign customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.


For the year ended December 31, 2007, sales to foreign customers, excluding our foreign sales made under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements directly between the U.S. Government and allied foreign governments represented approximately 13% of our consolidated sales. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:









• 
export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;










• 
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);










• 
the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;










• 
contract award and funding delays;










• 
potential restrictions on transfers of funds;










• 
foreign currency fluctuations;










• 
import and export duties and value added taxes;










• 
transportation delays and interruptions;










• 
uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and










• 
potential military conflicts and political risks.



While we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate.
