Item 1A.
 
Risk Factors
 Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our
business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business,
results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  Successful integration of
Biomet and anticipated benefits of the Biomet merger are not assured and integration matters could divert attention of management away from operations. Also, the merger could have an adverse effect on our business relationships. 
Although Biomet has become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours, it is initially continuing its operations on a basis that is
separate from the legacy Zimmer operations. There can be no assurance that Biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. In addition, the market segments in which Biomet operates may experience declines in demand and/or
new competitors. Customers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us and/or Biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or Biomet as a
result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us and/or Biomet or otherwise.  Our
ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Biomet merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the legacy businesses. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of Biomet with ours
involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process is time-consuming and expensive, disrupts the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us, including cost
synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include: 


•
 
 managing a larger combined company; 


•
 
 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; 


•
 
 issues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces; 


•
 
 difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel; 


•
 
 loss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers; 


•
 
 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; 


•
 
 incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and 


•
 
 unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or Biomet’s business.

 Additionally, the integration of our and Biomet’s operations, products and personnel
may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. The attention of our management may be directed towards integration considerations and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, and matters related to the
integration may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us. The diversion of management’s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the
transition and integration process, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.  Even if our businesses
are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the merger, including anticipated synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities, within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition, we expect to incur significant
integration and restructuring expenses to realize synergies. However, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the
savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may
offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. 
Any of these matters could adversely affect our businesses or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.
 We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Biomet merger and may not be able to meet all of our
debt obligations.  We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Biomet merger. At
December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $11.6 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. We funded the cash portion of the merger consideration, the pay-off of certain indebtedness of Biomet and the payment of
transaction-related expenses through a combination of available cash-on-hand and proceeds from debt financings, including proceeds from a $7.65 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2015, and borrowings of $3.0 billion under our $4.35
billion credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $339.8 million. As a
result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. The increased level of debt could, among other things: 


•
 
 require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available
for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•
 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other
general corporate requirements; 


•
 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 


•
 
 restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities; 


•
 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; 


•
 
 adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds
could be impaired; 


•
 
 adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and 


•
 
 limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.
 If we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face substantial
penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Our industry is subject to
various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark law, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and
similar state and foreign laws. In addition, we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters, sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our
international operations. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including
Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG-HHS”), the SEC, the Office of
Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce and state attorneys general. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations
are uncertain and subject to change.  Biomet is involved in ongoing governmental investigations, the results of which may
adversely impact our business and results of operations. Further, if Biomet fails to comply with the terms of the DPA that it entered into in March 2012, it may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare
programs.  On March 26, 2012, Biomet entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ and
a Consent to Final Judgment (“Consent”) with the SEC related to an investigation by the DOJ and the SEC into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in the marketing and sale of medical devices in
certain foreign countries. Pursuant to the DPA, the DOJ agreed to defer prosecution of Biomet in connection with those matters,


 
provided that Biomet satisfies its obligations under the DPA over the term of the DPA. The DPA had a three-year term and provided that it could be extended in the sole discretion of the DOJ for
an additional year.  Pursuant to the Consent, Biomet consented to the entry of a Final Judgment which, among other things,
permanently enjoined Biomet from violating the provisions of the FCPA. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the DPA, an independent external compliance monitor was appointed to review Biomet’s compliance with the DPA, particularly in relation
to Biomet’s international sales practices. The Consent that Biomet entered into with the SEC mirrors the DPA’s provisions with respect to the compliance monitor.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In October 2013, Biomet became aware of certain alleged improprieties regarding its operations in Brazil and Mexico, including alleged improprieties that predated the entry of the DPA. Biomet
retained counsel and other experts to investigate both matters. Based on the results of the ongoing investigations, Biomet has terminated, suspended or otherwise disciplined certain of the employees and executives involved in these matters, and
has taken certain other remedial measures. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPA, in April 2014 and thereafter, Biomet disclosed these matters to and discussed these matters with the independent compliance monitor and the DOJ and
SEC. On July 2, 2014 and July 13, 2015, the SEC issued subpoenas to Biomet requiring that Biomet produce certain documents relating to such matters. These matters remain under investigation by the DOJ. 
On March 13, 2015, the DOJ informed Biomet that the DPA and the independent compliance monitor’s appointment have been extended
for an additional year. On April 2, 2015, at the request of the staff of the SEC, Biomet consented to an amendment to the Final Judgment to extend the term of the compliance monitor’s appointment for one year from the date of entry of the
Amended Final Judgment.  Pursuant to the DPA, the DOJ has sole discretion to determine whether conduct by Biomet constitutes a
violation or breach of the DPA. The DOJ has informed Biomet that it retains its rights under the DPA to bring further action against Biomet relating to the conduct in Brazil and Mexico referenced above or the violations set forth in the
DPA. The DOJ could, among other things, revoke the DPA or prosecute Biomet and/or the involved employees and executives. Biomet continues to cooperate with the SEC and DOJ and expects that discussions with the SEC and the DOJ will continue.
 In June 2013, Biomet received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey requesting
various documents relating to the fitting of custom-fabricated or custom-fitted orthoses, or bracing, to patients in New Jersey, Texas and Washington. Biomet has produced responsive documents and is fully cooperating with the request of the U.S.
Attorney’s Office. We may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In July 2011, Biomet received an administrative subpoena from OFAC, requesting documents concerning the export of products to Iran. OFAC informed Biomet that the subpoena related to allegations that
Biomet may have been involved in

unauthorized sales of dental products to Iran. Biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation and submitted its response to the subpoena in October 2011. We may need to devote
significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.  In February 2010, Biomet
received a subpoena from the OIG-HHS requesting various documents relating to agreements or arrangements between physicians and Biomet’s Interpore Cross subsidiary for the period from 1999 through the date of the subpoena and the marketing and
sales activities associated with Interpore Cross’ spinal products. Biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation. We may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.
 As a result of the merger, all obligations and liabilities of Biomet related to the above matters have been assumed by us as
the combined company. From time to time, we are, and may continue to be, the subject of additional investigations. If, as a result of the investigations described above or any additional investigations, we are found to have violated one or
more applicable laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful, we may have to modify those practices,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We
are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal,
state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in
receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including the Quality System regulation,
recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form
483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective
or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket
approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign


 
governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also
impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend
prosecution to the DOJ. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.  In 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA citing concerns relating to certain
processes pertaining to products manufactured at our Ponce, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. In June 2015, Biomet received a warning letter from the FDA that requested additional information to allow the FDA to evaluate the adequacy of
Biomet’s responses to certain Form 483 observations issued following an inspection of Biomet’s Zhejiang, China manufacturing facility in January 2015. As of December 31, 2015, these warning letters remained pending. Until the
violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information regarding these and other FDA regulatory matters can be found in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.  Interruption of
our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We have
manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural
disaster-related events, or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the Quality System regulation and Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, equipment
breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to
meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to
the need for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products
against those of our competitors.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or future products
could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new
products and technologies. Competition is primarily on the basis of: 


•
 
 technology; 


•
 
 innovation; 


•
 
 quality; 


•
 
 reputation; and 


•
 
 customer service.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including: 


•
 
 local distribution systems; 


•
 
 complex regulatory environments; and 


•
 
 differing medical philosophies and product preferences.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our competitors may: 


•
 
 have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us; 


•
 
 respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; 


•
 
 undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; 


•
 
 adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or 


•
 
 be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. 
Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
 If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers
may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.  Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad
depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’
detailed knowledge of products and instruments. Further, the legacy independent agents and distributors of us or Biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or Biomet
as a result of the merger. A loss of a significant number of the combined company’s agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline. 
Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of: 


•
 
 evolving customer needs; 


•
 
 changing demographics; 


•
 
 slowing industry growth rates; 


•
 
 declines in the reconstructive implant market; 


•
 
 the introduction of new products and technologies;




•
 
 evolving surgical philosophies; and 


•
 
 evolving industry standards.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new
product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 


•
 
 properly identify and anticipate customer needs; 


•
 
 commercialize new products in a timely manner; 


•
 
 manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time; 


•
 
 differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings; 


•
 
 achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products; 


•
 
 satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost
procedures; 


•
 
 innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and 


•
 
 provide adequate medical education relating to new products.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors: 


•
 
 entrenched patterns of clinical practice; 


•
 
 the need for regulatory clearance; and 


•
 
 uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to
fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and
they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be
harmed.  We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which
receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline
to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.  In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain
healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products
may decline, or we may experience increased

pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. 
We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. If
key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing organizations
negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers
selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s
products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to
lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.  We
conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs. 
We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived over 40 percent of our net sales in 2015 from outside the U.S. We intend
to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and will
continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: 


•
 
 changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; 


•
 
 unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; 


•
 
 differing local product preferences and product requirements; 


•
 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 


•
 
 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.; 


•
 
 trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our
operating costs; 


•
 
 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; 


•
 
 complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; 


•
 
  extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the FCPA; 


•
 
 effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;




•
 
 difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; 


•
 
 labor force instability; 


•
 
 potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and 


•
 
 political and economic instability.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
 Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition. We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our
products from third-party vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities. Certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality
considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or
cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors’ manufacturing processes. A
reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or
components could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, we are subject to the
SEC’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. We
filed reports on Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters in June 2014 and 2015 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward. This rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the
manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. In addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant
minerals and metals used in our products. We have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. As a result,
we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.  We may have additional tax liabilities.
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions

and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the
period or periods for which that determination is made.  We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the
U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S.
multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. 
We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to
decline and expose us to counterparty risks.  A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and
Japan. The U.S. Dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well as other
currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.  Pending and future product liability claims and litigation
could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation. 
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and
marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or
product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As discussed further in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the Durom<FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">® Acetabular Component (“Durom Cup”), certain products within the NexGen Knee System,
and the M2a-Magnum™ hip system. The majority of the Durom Cup cases are pending in a federal
Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL”) in the District of New Jersey (In Re: Zimmer Durom Hip Cup Products Liability Litigation); the majority of the NexGen Knee System cases are pending in a federal MDL in the Northern District
of Illinois (In Re: Zimmer NexGen Knee Implant Products Liability Litigation); and the majority of the M2a-Magnum hip system cases are pending in a federal MDL in the Northern District of


 
Indiana (In Re: Biomet M2a Magnum Hip Implant Products Liability Litigation). We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to
various other products. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could
have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.  Although we
maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. Furthermore, even if any product
liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy
limits. Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in
our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others. 
Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our
industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of
time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to
sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and
non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements
may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged
or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that

may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. 
In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain
sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our
employees, consultants and collaborators. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.  We are
involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.  In addition to intellectual property and product
liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these
matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the
amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
 We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the
integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be adversely affected.  We are increasingly dependent on
sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, including the Biomet
merger, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain,
protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In
addition, third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity
effectively, we could: 


•
 
 lose existing customers;




•
 
 have difficulty attracting new customers; 


•
 
 have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; 


•
 
 have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud; 


•
 
 have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals; 


•
 
 have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed; 


•
 
 incur increased operating expenses; 


•
 
 incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or 


•
 
 suffer other adverse consequences.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading
and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption,
corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Future material
impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we had $9.9 billion in goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisition activity, including the Biomet
merger, and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets
may not be recoverable. If the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one
or more of our businesses decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible
assets would negatively affect our results of operations.  Certain investors continue to have influence over us, including
in connection with decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit other stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. 
In connection with our acquisition of Biomet, we entered into a stockholders agreement (the “stockholders agreement”) with LVB
Acquisition Holding, LLC and its owners party thereto (collectively, the “Sponsors”). The Sponsors and certain of their affiliates currently hold approximately 9.4% of our common stock. In addition, representatives of the Sponsors
currently have the right to designate two members of our board of directors. As a result, the Sponsors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction (and the terms thereof). 
Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that
compete directly or indirectly with us. One

or more of these entities may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
 Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the
market price for our common stock to decline.  Pursuant to the stockholders’ agreement, we have filed a shelf
registration statement with the SEC, registering shares of our common stock for resale by the Sponsors. Two of the Sponsors recently completed the sale of approximately 11.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering. The
Sponsors own approximately 18.6 million additional shares that may be offered and sold under the resale registration statement. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by us or our existing stockholders,
or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in
the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.  Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents
could delay or prevent a change of control.  Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated
By-Laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its
best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">These provisions provide for, among other things: 


•
 
 the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action; 


•
 
 advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;



•
 
 certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and 


•
 
 the prohibition on engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the time at which a
person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our
stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.

 Our Restated By-Laws designate certain Delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum
for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
 Our Restated By-Laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court
located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any
beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders,
(iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Restated By-Laws,
as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds
favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable
to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.  We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in
2015. While the particular material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2015, additional material weaknesses or relapses of this material weakness could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements. 
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. As discussed in Part II, Item 9A of this report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2015 related to the control over accounting
for non-routine, complex transactions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we executed our remediation plans to address the material weakness. However, if the remedial measures are not adhered
to or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our
