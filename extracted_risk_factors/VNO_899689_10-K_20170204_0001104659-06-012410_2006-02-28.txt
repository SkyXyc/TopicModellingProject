OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

 

Our business
objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective
by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating
strategies through:

 

•                  Maintaining
a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an
entrepreneurial spirit;

•                  Investing
in properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital
appreciation;

•                  Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

•                  Investing
in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area;

•                  Investing
in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate
component;

•                  Developing
and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize
value; and

•                  Providing
specialty financing to real estate related companies.

 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using
internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing
the public and private capital markets.

 

2005 ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

 

Beverly Connection

 

On March 5, 2005, the Company acquired a 50% interest
in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two-level urban shopping center,
containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for
$10,700,000 in cash. The Company also provided the venture with a $59,500,000
first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity
in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a
three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity and
debt. On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of the Company’s loan to the venture
was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as the Company’s
existing preferred equity. The balance of the loan of $24,500,000 was extended
to April 11, 2006 and bears interest at 10%. The shopping center is anchored by
CompUSA, Old Navy and Sports Chalet. The venture is redeveloping the existing
retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop residential
condominiums and assisted living facilities.

 

Westbury Retail Condominium

 

On May 20, 2005, the Company acquired the retail
condominium of the former Westbury Hotel in Manhattan, consisting of the entire
block front on Madison Avenue between 69th Street and 70th
Street, for $113,000,000 in cash. Simultaneously with the closing, the Company
placed an $80,000,000 mortgage loan on the property bearing interest at 5.292%
and maturing in 2018. The remaining portion of the purchase price was funded as
part of a Section 1031 tax-free “like-kind” exchange with a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the 400 North LaSalle Residential Tower in April
2005. The property contains approximately 17,000 square feet and is fully
occupied by luxury retailers, Cartier, Chloe and Gucci under leases that expire
in 2018.

 

Bowen Building

 

On June 13, 2005, the Company acquired the 90% that it
did not already own of the Bowen Building, a 231,000 square foot class A office
building located at 875 15th Street N.W. in the Central Business
District of Washington, D.C. The purchase price was $119,000,000, consisting of
$63,000,000 in cash and $56,000,000 of existing mortgage debt, which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, (5.66% as of December 31, 2005) and is due in

H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

 

On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which
owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50%
interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34
acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit
apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in
Washington, D.C. containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was
approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and
$52,100,000 for the Company’s pro rata share of existing mortgage debt.

 

On July 22, 2005, two corporations 50% owned by H
Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties
affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District
of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated
parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered
with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company’s acquisition of
H Street. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one
of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company’s
acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer
and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company’s acquisition and the right
to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company. On September 12, 2005,
the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their
acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street’s full shareholder rights
and damages. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. The
Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit
and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.

 

Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”)

 

On July 21, 2005,
a joint venture owned equally by the Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for $26.75 per share in cash or approximately
$6.6 billion. In connection therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the
$1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and
$21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the Company.

 

On August 29,
2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000 of the $1.9 billion one-year senior
unsecured bridge loan financing provided to Toys. The loan is senior to the acquisition
equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt. The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11%
and provides for an initial .375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at
the end of three and six months if the loan has not been repaid. The loan is
prepayable at any time without penalty. On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of
this loan was repaid to the Company.

 

On January 9,
2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys “R” Us
stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into
Babies “R” Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been
sold. Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition of the real estate of the
remaining 69 stores. As a result of the store-closing program, Toys will incur
restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before
tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost of liquidating inventory. Of this
amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys’ fourth quarter
ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the first quarter
of their next fiscal year. These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain
subject to change. The Company’s 32.95% share of the $155,000,000 charge is
$51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no income statement effect as a
result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the
cost of liquidating the inventory of approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will
be recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2006.

 

40 East 66th Street

 

On July 25, 2005,
the Company acquired a property located at Madison Avenue and East 66th
Street in Manhattan for $158,000,000 in cash. The property contains 37 rental
apartments with an aggregate of 85,000 square feet, and 10,000 square feet of
retail space.

On August 26,
2005, a joint venture in which the Company has a 90% interest acquired a
property located at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan for $136,550,000. The
Company and its partner invested cash of $43,400,000 and $4,800,000,
respectively, in the venture to acquire the property. The venture obtained a
$95,000,000 mortgage loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.50% (8.04% as of
December 31, 2005) and matures in August 2006, with two six-month extensions. The
property contains 122 rental apartments with an aggregate of 133,000 square
feet and 5,700 square feet of commercial space.

Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”)

 

In July and August 2004, the
Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and
Co. (“Sears”) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share. On
March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the
Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq: SHLD)
(“Sears Holdings”) and $21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears
common shares. The Sears Holdings common shares were valued at $48,143,000,
based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of $130.00. As a result the
Company recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the
aggregate cost basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total
consideration received of $69,940,000. On April 4, 2005, 99,393 of the
Company’s Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were
utilized to satisfy a third-party participation. The remaining 270,937 Sears
Holdings shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average
sales price of $125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition
of $1,137,000, based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per
share. The Company’s net gain on its investment in these Sears shares was
$26,514,000.

 

In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an
economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a
series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution
pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a
put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put
options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an
aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash
settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for
the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the
same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares
and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45
basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the
mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.

 

On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between
Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company’s
derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a
derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings
valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and
$146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of
$58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30,
2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold
at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share. In accordance with the
derivative agreements, the proceeds from these sales will remain in the
derivative position until the entire position is settled or until expiration in
April 2006. Based on Sears Holdings’ closing share price on December 31, 2005
of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative position have a market value
of $241,361,000, which together with cash of $196,499,000 aggregates
$437,860,000. In the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the
Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which
consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining shares in
the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December
31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a
weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting
primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points.

 

The Company’s aggregate net income recognized on the
owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005
was $124,266,000.

 

Investment
in Sears Canada Inc. (“Sears Canada”)

 

In connection with the Company’s investment in Sears
Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears
Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of
$143,737,000, or $19.16 per share. On December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a
special dividend, of which Vornado’s share was $120,500,000. As a result, the
Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in
addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a
$.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
December 27, 2005. The Company accounts for its investment in Sears Canada as a
marketable equity security classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, the
common shares are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis through “Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income” on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2005, based
on a closing share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income is $53,870,000.

Investment in McDonald’s
Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

 

In July 2005, the Company
acquired an aggregate of 858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an
average price of $29.54 per share. These shares are recorded as marketable
equity securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are
classified as “available for sale.” Appreciation or depreciation in the fair
market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in
“accumulated other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income. At
December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’ closing stock price of $33.72 per share,
$3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in
“accumulated other comprehensive income.”

 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in an
additional 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately
negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the
Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the
same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options have
an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate
of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September
10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the
strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is
credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the
Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the
underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual
rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and
do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting
from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of
(i) $15,239,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005,
based on McDonalds’ closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of
dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in
strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge.

 

Based on McDonalds’ most recent
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company’s aggregate
investment in McDonalds represents 1.2% of McDonalds’ outstanding common
shares.

2005 DISPOSITIONS

 

400 North LaSalle

 

On April 21, 2005, the Company, through its 85% owned
joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower
in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale of
$31,614,000. All of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax-free
“like-kind” exchange investments pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

 

3700 Las Vegas Boulevard

 

On December 30, 2005, the
Company sold its $3,050,000 senior preferred equity in 3700 Associates LLC,
which owns 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard, a development land parcel, and recognized
a net gain of $12,110,000. In addition, the purchaser repaid the Company’s
$5,000,000 senior mezzanine loan to the venture.

notes which are subordinate to the $2,400,000,000 credit facility and senior to
over $700,000,000 of equity contributed to finance the acquisition. These notes
mature in February 2015, provide for a 1.5% placement fee, and bear interest at

During 2004 and 2005, the PTO vacated approximately
1,864,000 square feet in the Company’s Crystal City office buildings and will
vacate an additional 75,000 square feet in the first quarter of 2006. The
Company plans to redevelop certain of these buildings, including Crystal Plaza
Two, Three and Four, which have been taken out of service. Crystal Plaza Two,
subject to governmental approvals, will be converted from a 13-story office
building, containing 181,000 square feet, to a 19-story, 256 unit, residential
tower containing 265,000 rentable/saleable square feet, at an estimated cost of
$85,000,000 to $92,000,000. Renovations to Crystal Plaza Three and Four include
new mechanical systems, restrooms, lobbies and corridors. The renovations to
Crystal Plaza Three and Four are expected to be completed by the end of 2006 at
an approximate cost of $65,900,000. Renovations to the remaining office
buildings not taken out of service include common area and exterior
renovations. See Item II — Properties for details of the lease up of the PTO
space.

 

In addition, to the projects noted above, on July 19,
2005 a joint venture, owned 50% by the Company, entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding and has been conditionally designated as the developer to convert
a portion of the Farley Post Office in Manhattan into the new Moynihan Train
Station. The plans for the Moynihan Station project involve 300,000 square feet
for a new transportation facility to be financed with public funding, as well
as 850,000 square feet of commercial space and up to 1,000,000 square feet of
air rights intended to be transferred to an adjacent site. The commercial space
is currently anticipated to include a variety of retail uses, restaurants, a
boutique hotel and merchandise mart space. The joint venture is also
considering alternate variations of this project, which may include a sports
arena, which would give rise to a much larger scale redevelopment opportunity.

 

The Company is also in the pre-development phase of
other real estate projects for which final plans and budgeted costs have yet to
be determined. Such projects include: (i) redeveloping certain shopping malls,
including the South Hills and Springfield Malls, (ii) redeveloping and
expanding retail space in the Penn Plaza area, (iii) converting an industrial
warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey to 500,000 square feet of retail space, (iv)
converting residential apartment buildings to condominiums, including 220
Central Park South and 40 East 66th Street, (v) redeveloping certain
assets in the SoHo area of Manhattan, and (vi) redeveloping and expanding the
Beverly Connection shopping center in Los Angeles, California to include
residential condominium units and assisted living facilities.

 

There can be no assurance that any of the above
projects will commence or be completed on schedule or on budget.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

 

On August 10, 2005, the Company sold 9,000,000 common
shares at a price of $86.75 per share for gross proceeds of $780,750,000 in a
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.  During
2005, the Company issued $382,500,000 of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares
at a weighted average rate of 6.66% and $100,000,000 Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at a weighted average rate of
6.75% and redeemed $115,000,000 and $697,000,000 of outstanding Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares and Units with a weighted average rate of 8.50% and
8.25%, respectively. The Company also completed property level financings of
$543,600,000 and issued $500,000,000 of 3.875% exchangeable senior debentures
due 2025.

 

On February 16, 2006, the Company completed a public
offering of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.60% senior unsecured notes due
2011 pursuant to an effective registration statement. The net proceeds from
this offering, after underwriters’ discount, were $248,265,000.

 

The Company may seek to obtain additional capital
through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no
express policy with respect thereto. The Company may also offer its shares or
Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise re-acquire its shares or any other securities in the future.

 

SEASONALITY

 

The Company’s revenues and expenses are subject to
seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash
flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically,
Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which the Company records on a one-quarter lag
basis in its first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net
income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced
higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart
segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters
of the year due to major trade shows in those quarters. The Retail segment
revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of
percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has
experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and
occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday season’s impact on the
food industry.

 

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF
REVENUES

 

None of the Company’s tenants represented more than
10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

 

The Company’s operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under certain of these environmental laws a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to
investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The
owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third
parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These
laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of
contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair the
Company’s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real
estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air
quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of
asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or
remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment
containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are
also regulated by federal and state laws. The Company is also subject to risks
associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as
molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be
alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. The Company could incur fines for environmental
compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to
the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of
environmental contamination or human exposure at or from the Company’s
properties.

 

Each of the Company’s properties has been subjected to
varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any environmental condition material to the
Company’s business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or
undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of
contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the
contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in
significant costs to the Company.

COMPETITION

 

The Company’s business segments – Office, Retail,
Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, and Toys “R” Us,
as well as its other investments, operate in highly competitive environments. The
Company has a large concentration of properties in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area. The
Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and
developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness
of location, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services
provided. The Company’s success depends upon, among other factors, trends of
the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of
current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of
capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations,
legislation and population trends. The Company’s interest in Toys “R” Us will
also be affected by competition from discount and mass merchandisers.

 

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

 

Acquisitions and investments are not required to be
based on specific allocation by type of property. The Company has historically held
its properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that
properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances
warrant, from time to time. Further, the Company has not adopted a policy that
limits the amount or percentage of assets which would be invested in a specific
property. While the Company may seek the vote of its shareholders in connection
with any particular material transaction, generally the Company’s activities
are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by its Board of Trustees
without the vote of shareholders.

 

EMPLOYEES

 

As of December 31, 2005, the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries had approximately 3,015 employees, of which 269
were corporate staff. The Office segment had 107 employees and 1,286 employees
of Building Maintenance Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Retail
segment, the Merchandise Mart segment, the Washington D.C. Office segment and
the Hotel Pennsylvania had 71, 511, 190 and 524 employees, respectively. The
forgoing does not include employees of partially-owned entities, including
6,459 Americold Realty Trust employees and 79,872 Toys “R” Us, Inc. employees.

 

SEGMENT DATA

 

The Company operates in five business segments: Office
Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature
Controlled Logistics and Toys “R” Us.

 

The Merchandise Mart segment has trade show operations
in Canada. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment manages one warehouse
in Canada. The Toys segment operates in 306 locations internationally. In
addition, the Company has a 25% equity investment in TCG Urban Infrastructure
Holdings in India, which is included in the Other segment. Information related
to the Company’s business segments for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is set

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

 

Set forth below are material factors that may
adversely affect our business and operations.

 

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate
Due to Various Factors.

 

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These
conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash.

 

The factors that affect the value of our real estate
include, among other things:

 

•      national,
regional and local economic conditions;

•      consequences
of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United
States;

•      our
ability to secure adequate insurance;

•      local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

•      competition
from other available space;

•      whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

•      the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

•      whether
we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to
tenants;

•      how
well we manage our properties;

•      fluctuations
in interest rates;

•      changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

•      changes
in market rental rates;

•      the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•      changes
in taxation or zoning laws;

•      government
regulation;

•      Vornado
Realty Trust’s failure to continue to qualify as a real estate investment
trust;

•      availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

•      potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and

•      general
competitive factors.

 

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our
properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If
our rental revenues decline, we generally would expect to have less cash
available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our shareholders. In
addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate
taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents
decline.

 

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically
favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants, who may not be able to
pay.

 

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space
in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition,
because a substantial majority of our income comes from renting of real
property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available
for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of
our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our levels
of occupancy on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might
not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur
substantial legal costs.

 

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our
revenues and available cash.

 

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared
bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the
future. If a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the rental
property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational
difficulties. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency
of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of
the affected property. Our leases generally do not contain restrictions
designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants. As a result, the
bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net
income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders or the payment
of our indebtedness.

Real estate is a competitive business.

 

Our business segments – Office, Retail, Merchandise
Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, Toys “R” Us and Other –
operate in highly competitive environments. We have a large concentration of
properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C.
and Northern Virginia area. We compete with a large number of real estate
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rent
charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and breadth
and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other
factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and
operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers,
availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes,
governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.

 

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

 

Our operations and properties are subject to various
federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the
environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and
health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner
or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up
hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may
also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred
by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release
of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or
the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease
real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws
and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal
of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal
and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to
chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and
bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to
allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We
could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs
of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks
or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure
at or from our properties.

 

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying
degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition
material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance
concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known
scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the
contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in
significant costs to us.

 

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by
insurance.

 

We carry comprehensive liability and all risk property
insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage,
(iv) ”acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Extension Act of 2005, which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance)
with respect to our assets.  Below is a summary of the current all risk
property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect though September 2006
for each of the following business segments:

(1)                   Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub-limit
shown in the adjacent column.

 

In addition to the coverage above, we carry lesser
amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Extension Act of 2005.  To the extent that we incur losses in excess of
our insurance coverage, these losses would be borne by us and could be
material.

 

14












 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans
secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), Vornado
Realty L.P.’s senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, exchangeable
senior debentures due 2025 and our revolving credit agreement, contain
customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, we may
not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in
the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are
able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension of 2005 is not
extended past 2007, it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or
refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

 

Because
we operate one hotel property, we face the risks associated with the
hospitality industry.

 

We own the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. If the
hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased,
which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our
shareholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel
industry, and may reduce the revenues generated by our hotel property:

 

•                  our hotel competes for guests with other
hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

•                  if there is an increase in operating costs
resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such
increase by increasing room rates;

•                  our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and
seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

•                  our hotel is subject to general and local
economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general,
including war and terrorism; and

•                  physical condition, which may require
substantial additional capital.

 

Because of the ownership structure of our hotel, we
face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

 

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not
allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease The
Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. While the TRS
structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is
subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal
and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations
that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable
to TRS’s are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the
hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department
and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot
predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may
prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and,
therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.

 

Compliance or
failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

 

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires
that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled
persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal
government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time
persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties
under this Act, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material
expense or liability. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.

 

Our properties are subject to various federal, state
and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety
requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur
fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements
will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant
unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of
operations.

Our Investments Are Concentrated in the New York and
Washington D.C. Metropolitan Areas.  Circumstances Affecting These Areas
Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

 

A significant portion of our properties are in the New
York City/New Jersey and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas and are affected
by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

 

During 2005, approximately 73% of our EBITDA excluding
items that affect comparability, came from properties located in New Jersey and
the New York City and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas.  In
addition, we may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in New Jersey and the New York City and Washington, D.C.
metropolitan areas.  Like other real estate markets, the real estate
markets in these areas have experienced economic downturns in the past, and we
cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in both the
short and long term.  Declines in the economy or a decline in the real
estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the
value of our properties.  The factors affecting economic conditions in
these regions include:

 

•                space
needs of the United States Government, including the effect of base closures
and repositioning under the  Defense Base Closure and
Realignment Act of 1990, as amended;

•      business
layoffs or downsizing;

•      industry
slowdowns;

•      relocations
of businesses;

•      changing
demographics;

•      increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•                financial
performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial,
technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

•      infrastructure
quality; and

•      any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

 

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects
of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the
New York City/New Jersey and Washington, D.C. regions, and more generally of
the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas.  If these
conditions persist or if there is any local, national or global economic
downturn, our businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected.

 

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11,
2001 in New York City and the Washington, D.C. area, may adversely affect the
value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

 

We have significant investments in large metropolitan
areas, including the New York, Washington, D.C. and Chicago metropolitan
areas.  In the aftermath of any terrorist attacks, tenants in these areas
may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas
of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future
terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in
these areas.  This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for
space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and
force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms.  As a result,
the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline
materially.

 

We May Acquire or Sell Additional Assets or
Develop Additional Properties.  Our Failure or Inability to Consummate
These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely
Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

 

We have grown rapidly through acquisitions.  We
may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could
adversely affect our stock price.

 

We have experienced rapid growth in recent years,
increasing our total assets from approximately $565 million at
December 31, 1996 to approximately $13.6 billion at December 31,
2005.  We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the
future or manage our growth effectively.  Our failure to do so may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies and this may create risks.

 

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or
development is consistent with our business strategies.  We may not,
however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing
developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in
pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our
costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in
leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover
their costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in
integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert
management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or
industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result
in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or
development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to
recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter
not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies
will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of
which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development
of our existing properties presents similar risks.

 

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate
quickly.

 

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to
buy and sell quickly.  Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary
our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

 

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain
properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might
otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

 

As part of an acquisition of a property, including our
January 1, 2002, acquisition of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P.’s
13.0 million square foot portfolio, we may agree, and in the case of Charles E.
Smith Commercial Realty L.P. did agree, with the seller that we will not
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them
for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax
costs of the seller.  These agreements could result in our holding on to
properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance
indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance.

 

On January 1, 2002, we completed the acquisition
of the 66% interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. that we did not
previously own.  The terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or to finance or refinance, the properties formerly owned
by Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P., which could result in our inability
to sell these properties at an opportune time and increased costs to us.

 

Subject to limited exceptions, we are restricted from
selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in
the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia or an interest in our division
that manages the majority of our office properties in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area, which we refer to as the Washington D.C. Office Division,
for a period of 12 years with respect to certain properties located in the
Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia or six years with respect to an
interest in the Washington D.C. Office Division.  These restrictions,
which currently cover approximately 13.0 million square feet of space, could
result in our inability to sell these properties or an interest in the Washington
D.C. Office Division at an opportune time and increase costs to us.

 

17












 

From time to time we make investments in companies
over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in
industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than
investing in real estate.

 

From time to time we make debt or equity investments
in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole
control.  These investments include but are not limited to:  a 33%
interest in Alexander’s, Inc.; a 15.8% interest in The Newkirk Master
Limited Partnership; a 11.3% interest in GMH Communities L.P.; a 1.3% common
equity interest in Sears Holdings Corporation; a 1.2% common equity interest in
McDonalds Corporation; a 7.0% common equity interest in Sears Canada, Inc.; and
equity and mezzanine investments in other real estate related companies. 
In addition, on July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own equally with
Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys “R”
Us, Inc.  Although they generally have a significant real estate
component, several of these entities operate in businesses that are different
from our line of business including, without limitation, operating or managing
toy stores, department stores, fast food restaurants, refrigerated warehouses
and student and military housing facilities. Consequently, our investment in
these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and financial
risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have
sole control over the operations of these businesses.  From time to time
we may (or may seek to) make additional investments in or acquire other
entities that may subject us to additional similar risks. Our investments in
entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures,
present additional risks such as our having differing objectives than our
partners or the entities in which we invest or our becoming involved in disputes
or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls
and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to comply
with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

 

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail
environment.

 

A substantial proportion of our properties are in the
retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment
in retailers such as Toys “R” Us, Inc. See “Our
investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other
lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our
reported earnings” below. This means that we are subject to factors
that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer
spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing
competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog
companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our
retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment and the
willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.

 

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

 

We own several regional malls and other shopping
centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other
tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value
of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to
meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue
operations or ceased their operations. If the sales of stores operating in our
properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of
anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents
or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor,
we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

 

Our investment in Toys
“R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and
may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

 

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own
equally with Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired
Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”). Because Toys is a retailer, its operations
subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those
presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly
seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than
80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on
December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on
the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata
share of Toys’ net income (loss) on a one quarter-lag basis.  For example,
our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005
include Toys’ financial results for their third quarter ended October 29,
2005, and our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006 will
include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended
October 28, 2006, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2005. Because
of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net income will likely show increased
volatility.

Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise
to Operational and Financial Risks.

 

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make
Investments.

 

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the
growth of our business.  This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distribute 90%
of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There
is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate
level tax in lieu thereof.  Our access to debt or equity financing depends
on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on
conditions in the capital markets generally.  We and other companies in
the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing
from time to time.  Although we believe that we will be able to finance
any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, new financing
may not be available on acceptable terms.

 

For information about our available sources of funds,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

 

Vornado Realty Trust depends on dividends and
distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and
preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts
payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any
dividends or distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

 

Substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s assets are
held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries.  The Operating Partnership
depends for substantially all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by
its subsidiaries, and Vornado Realty Trust in turn depends for substantially
all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by the Operating
Partnership.  The creditors of each of Vornado Realty Trust’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders.  Thus, the Operating Partnership’s
ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its
subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and
then to make distributions to the Operating Partnership.  Likewise,
Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and
preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to
satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to
holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty
Trust.

 

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of common units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado Realty Trust.  Thus, Vornado Realty Trust’s
ability to pay dividends to holders of its shares and satisfy its debt
obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its
obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of
preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust. 
As of December 31, 2005, there were nine series of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership not held by Vornado Realty Trust that have preference
over Vornado Realty Trust common shares with a total liquidation value of
$402,405,000.

 

In addition, Vornado Realty Trust’s participation in
any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of
the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if
any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied.

 

We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness, and its
cost, may increase.

 

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $6.3
billion in total debt outstanding.  Our ratio of total debt to total
enterprise value was approximately 35.6%.  When we say “enterprise value”
in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of Vornado Realty Trust’s
common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata
share of the debt of partially-owned entities.  In the future, we may
incur additional debt, and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total
enterprise value, to finance acquisitions or property developments. If our
level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default on
our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of
our floating rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or
instrument may increase.

 

19












 

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely
affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

 

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue
insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities
and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain customary
restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur
indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based
upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured
debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed
charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets
to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject
to compliance with certain financial and other covenants. In addition, failure
to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from
other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be
available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, our
ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may
be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance
coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace
or on commercially reasonable terms.

 

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under
our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt
secured by individual properties, to finance our acquisition and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon
maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be
adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders
can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the
property securing the defaulted loan.

 

Vornado Realty Trust might fail to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

 

Although we believe that we will remain organized and
will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we might fail to remain qualified in this way.  Qualification as
a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only
limited judicial or administrative interpretations.  Our qualification as
a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely
within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with
respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income
tax consequences of qualification as a REIT.

 

If, with respect to any taxable year, Vornado Realty
Trust fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT and does not qualify under
statutory relief provisions, it could not deduct distributions to shareholders
in computing its taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates.  The federal income tax payable
would include any applicable alternative minimum tax.  If Vornado Realty
Trust had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute
to shareholders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years
involved, and Vornado Realty Trust would no longer be required to distribute
money to shareholders.  In addition, Vornado Realty Trust would also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification was lost, unless it was entitled to relief
under the relevant statutory provisions.  Although Vornado Realty Trust
currently intends to operate in a manner designed to allow it to qualify as a
REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause it
to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.

 

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.

 

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws
or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

 

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations
and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

 

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the
Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty
Trust, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President of Vornado Realty Trust. While
we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of
their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our
common shares.

Vornado Realty Trust’s charter documents and applicable law
may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

 

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets
limits on the ownership of our shares.

 

Generally, for Vornado Realty Trust to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado Realty Trust
may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time
during the last half of Vornado Realty Trust’s taxable year.  The Internal
Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in
the preceding sentence to include some types of entities.  Under Vornado
Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person
may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9%
of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for
persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado Realty
Trust adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado Realty Trust’s
Board of Trustees.  These restrictions on transferability and ownership
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or
other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the
best interest of the shareholders.  We refer to Vornado Realty Trust’s
Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of
trust.”

 

We have a classified Board of Trustees and that may
reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

 

Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees is divided
into three classes of trustees.  Trustees of each class are chosen for
three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility
of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado Realty Trust, even
though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of
Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders.

 

We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely
affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

 

Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust authorizes
the Board of Trustees to:

 

•      cause
Vornado Realty Trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares
or preferred shares;

•      classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

•      set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified
shares that Vornado Realty Trust issues; and

•      increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado Realty Trust may issue.

 

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price
or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders,
although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of
preferred shares of this kind. Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust and
bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in
control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a
premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

 

The Maryland General Corporation Law contains
provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

 

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as
amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to real estate
investment trusts, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers,
consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and
reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland real estate
investment trust and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of
the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as
defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period
before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of
the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest
of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate
of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five years after the most
recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested
shareholder.  After that five-year period, any business combination of
these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and
approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled
to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust
and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting
shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with
whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected,
unless, among other conditions, the trust’s common shareholders receive a
minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration
is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
shareholder for its common shares.  The provisions of the MGCL do not
apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the
board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested
shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by
which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

 

21












 

In approving a
transaction, the board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance,
at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by
the board.  Vornado Realty Trust’s Board has adopted a resolution
exempting any business combination between any trustee or officer of Vornado
Realty Trust, or their affiliates, and Vornado Realty Trust.  As a result,
the trustees and officers of Vornado Realty Trust and their affiliates may be
able to enter into business combinations with Vornado Realty Trust that may not
be in the best interest of shareholders.  With respect to business
combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the
MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price
or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders.  The business
combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of
Vornado Realty Trust and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

 

We may change our policies without obtaining the
approval of our shareholders.

 

Our operating and financial policies, including our
policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies,
growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively
determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not
control these policies.

 

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions
May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

 

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise
substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other trustees and
officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with
us.

 

As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties, a New
Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 9.2% of the
common shares of Vornado Realty Trust and approximately 27.7% of the common
stock of Alexander’s, Inc.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell
B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. 
Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and
the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. 
Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also
directors of Alexander’s.

 

As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership
owned 33% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s.  Alexander’s is
a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties,
focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before
they ceased operations in 1992.  Alexander’s has six properties, which are
located in the New York City metropolitan area.  Mr. Roth and
Mr. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, are
directors of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight are trustees
of Vornado Realty Trust and are directors of Alexander’s.

 

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth
and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over
Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s and on the outcome of any matters
submitted to Vornado Realty Trust or Alexander’s shareholders for approval. 
In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure
may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight
and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders.  In
addition, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners currently
and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate
business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters
affecting us or Alexander’s, such as which of these entities or persons, if
any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus
of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which
these entities make investments, potential competition between business
activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, Interstate Properties
and Alexander’s, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the
future of these entities.

 

Vornado Realty Trust currently manages and leases the
real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for
which it receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent
and certain other commissions.  The management agreement has a term of one
year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties
on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  Vornado Realty Trust earned
$791,000, $726,000, and $703,000 of management fees under the management
agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
Because of the relationship among Vornado Realty Trust, Interstate Properties
and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the
management agreement and any future agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and
Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those Vornado Realty Trust could
have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

 

22












 

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s
and us.

 

As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership
owned 33% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s.  Alexander’s is
a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties,
focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before
they ceased operations in 1992.  Alexander’s has six properties. 
Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned an
additional 27.7% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s, as of December
31, 2005.  Mr. Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is Chief Executive Officer, a director of
Alexander’s and managing general partner of Interstate, and
Mr. Fascitelli, President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, is
President and a director of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Mandelbaum, West
and Wight, trustees of the Company, are also directors of Alexander’s and
general partners of Interstate.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

 

The Operating Partnership manages, develops and leases
the Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and
leasing agreements under which the Operating Partnership receives annual fees
from Alexander’s.  These agreements have a one-year term expiring in
March of each year, except that the Lexington Avenue management and
development agreements have a term lasting until substantial completion of
development of the Lexington Avenue property, and are all automatically
renewable.  Because Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s share common
senior management and because a majority of the trustees of Vornado Realty
Trust also constitute the majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms
of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s
may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated
third party.

 

For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership
of Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s, see “Steven
Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over
us.  They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or
positions in other entities that may compete with us” above.

 

The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the
Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

 

Vornado Realty Trust has many shares available for
future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

 

As of December 31, 2005, we had authorized but
unissued, 58,846,570 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value, and
70,310,600 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value, of which
25,381,264 preferred shares have not been reserved and remain available for
issuance as a newly-designated class of preferred.  We may issue these
authorized but unissued shares from time to time in public or private offerings
or in connection with acquisitions.

 

In addition, as of December 31, 2005, 15,333,673
Vornado Realty Trust common shares were reserved for issuance upon redemption
of Operating Partnership common units.  Some of these shares may be sold
in the public market after registration under the Securities Act under
registration rights agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and some holders of
common units of the Operating Partnership.  These shares may also be sold
in the public market under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other
available exemptions from registration.  In addition, Vornado Realty Trust
has reserved a number of common shares for issuance under its employee benefit
plans, and these common shares will be available for sale from time to
time.  Vornado Realty Trust has awarded shares of restricted stock and
granted options to purchase additional common shares to some of its executive
officers and employees. Of the authorized but unissued common and preferred
shares above, 43,694,714 common and 44,929,336 preferred shares, in the
aggregate, were reserved for issuance of shares upon the redemption of
Operating Partnership units, conversion of outstanding convertible securities,
under benefit plans or for other activity not directly under our control.

 

We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our
common shares, preferred shares or Operating Partnership common units, or the
perception that sales of common shares, preferred or Operating Partnership
common units could occur, will have on the market prices for Vornado Realty
Trust’s shares.

Changes in market conditions could hurt the market
price of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares.

 

The value of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares depends on
various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market
conditions that may affect the value of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares are the
following:

 

•    the
extent of institutional investor interest in us;

•            the
reputation of REITs generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities
in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other
real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

•    our
financial condition and performance; and

•    general
financial market conditions.

 

The stock market in recent years has experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.

 

Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of
Vornado Realty Trust’s shares.

 

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT
shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to
market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell
the shares.  If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of
REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate.  Higher interest rates
would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available
for distribution.  Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the
market price of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares to decline.
