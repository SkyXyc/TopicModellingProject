 of Part I of this Annual Report, and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and estimated reserve data.  At year-end 2014, 91% of our estimated proved reserves were natural gas and 55% of total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed, compared to 100% and 61%, respectively, in 2013 and 100% and 80%, respectively in 2012.  We operate, or if operations have not commenced, plan to operate, approximately 97% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index approximated 14.0 years at year-end 2014.  Natural gas sales accounted for nearly 100% of total operating revenues for the E&P segment in 2014, 2013 and 2012.  The following table provides an overall and categorical summary of our natural gas and oil reserves, as of fiscal year-end 2014 based on average fiscal year prices, and our well count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2014 and sets forth 2014 annual information related to production and capital investments for each of our operating areas:     7       Table of Contents

(6)     Assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended, leasehold expiring over the next three years will be 46,342 net acres in 2015, 41,184 net acres in 2016 and 44,256 net acres in 2017. Of this acreage, 16,876 net acres in 2015, 17,798 net acres in 2016 and 15,691 net acres in 2017 can be extended for an average of an additional 4.6 years.         (7)     Assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended, leasehold expiring over the next three years will be 64 net acres in 2015, zero net acres in 2016 and zero net acres in 2017.        (8)     Includes 123,442 net developed acres and 432 net undeveloped acres in the Arkoma Basin that are also within our Fayetteville Shale focus area but not included in the Fayetteville Shale acreage in the table above.  Assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended, leasehold expiring over the next three years will be 15,332 net acres in 2015, 5,533 net acres in 2016 and 986 net acres in 2017.        (9)     Assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended, our leasehold expiring over the next three years, excluding New Brunswick, Canada, the Lower Smackover Brown Dense area and the Sand Wash Basin will be 143,109 net acres in 2015, 302,688 net acres in 2016 and 221,189 net acres in 2017.  With regard to our acreage in New Brunswick, Canada, 2,518,518 net acres are scheduled to expire in March 2015.  In February 2015, we requested an extension of our license agreement. With regard to our acreage in the LSBD, assuming successful wells are not drilled and leases are not extended, leasehold expiring over the next three years will be 153,866 net acres in 2015, 60,078 net acres in 2016 and 17,057 net acres in 2017. With regard to our acreage in the Sand Wash Basin, assuming successful wells are not drilled and leases are not extended, leasehold expiring over the next three years will be 107,963 net acres in 2015, 85,977 net acres in 2016, and 34,970 net acres in 2017.        (10)     Pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure) is one measure of the value of a company’s proved reserves that we believe is used by         securities analysts to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes.  The reconciling difference in pre-tax PV-10 and the after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure, is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows from our proved natural gas and oil reserves.        (11)     Based upon pre-tax PV-10 of proved developed producing activities.  We refer you to Note 4 in our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our proved natural gas and oil reserves as well as our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to our proved natural gas and oil reserves.  We also refer you to the risk factor “Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate” in  of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.  Our Reserve Replacement  The reserve replacement ratio measures the ability of an exploration and production company to add new reserves to replace the reserves that are being depleted by its current production volumes.  The reserve replacement ratio, which we discuss below, is an important analytical measure used by investors and peers in the E&P industry to evaluate performance results and long-term prospects.  There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure, as it does not reflect the type of reserves or the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of the reserve additions.   In 2014, we replaced 591% of our production volumes with 1,693 Bcfe of proved reserve additions, net upward revisions of 543 Bcfe, and 2,304 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of acquisitions.  Of the reserve additions, 531 Bcfe were proved developed and 1,162 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  In 2014, upward reserve revisions resulting from higher gas prices totaled 38 Bcf, 10 Bcf and 6 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively.  We also had performance revisions in 2014 of (126) Bcf, 636 Bcf and (21) Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively.  Additionally, our reserves increased by 2,304 Bcfe in 2014 as a result of acquisitions primarily associated with acreage in Southwest Appalachia.  In 2013, we replaced 550% of our production volumes with 3,285 Bcfe of proved reserve additions, net upward revisions of 326 Bcfe, and 4 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of acquisitions.  Of the reserve additions, 945 Bcfe were proved developed and 2,340 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  In 2013, upward reserve revisions resulting from higher gas prices totaled 191 Bcf, 35 Bcf and 21 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively.  We also had upward performance revisions in 2013 of 16 Bcf, 62 Bcf and 1 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and New Ventures divisions, respectively.  Additionally, our reserves increased by 4 Bcf in 2013 as a result of our acquisition of natural gas leases and wells.  In 2012, we replaced our production volumes with 920 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of our drilling and acquisition program but also incurred net downward revisions of 2,088 Bcfe principally due to a decrease in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent due to downward performance revisions of 336 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 583 Bcfe were proved developed and 337 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The total downward reserve revisions were primarily impacted by the low commodity price environment in 2012 and to a lesser extent by downward performance revisions.  In 2012, downward reserve revisions resulting from lower gas prices totaled 1,684 Bcf, 9 Bcf and 59 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively.  We also had a net downward performance revision in 2012 of 362 Bcf and 10 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively.  We had a net upward performance revision in 2012 of 36 Bcf in Northeast Appalachia.  Additionally, our reserves decreased by 141 Bcfe in 2012 as a result of our disposition of natural gas leases and wells.  For the period ended December 31, 2014, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio, including revisions and acquisitions, was 351%. Our reserve replacement ratio for 2014, excluding reserve revisions, was 520%, compared to 501% in 2013 and 163% in 2012. Excluding reserve revisions and acquisitions, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio was 296%.  Since 2005, the substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our Fayetteville Shale division.  However, over the past several years, Northeast Appalachia has also contributed to an increasing amount of our reserve additions, totaling 836 Bcf, 1,200 Bcf and 500 Bcf in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Additionally, our reserves increased by 2,304 Bcfe in 2014 as a result of acquisitions primarily associated with acreage in Southwest Appalachia. We expect our drilling programs in the Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia, and Southwest Appalachia to continue to be the primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control.  We refer you to the risk factors “Our drilling plans are subject to change” and “Our exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted    11       Table of Contents   returns” in  of Part I of this Annual Report.   Following the commencement of two court actions, now consolidated, alleging deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Statement issued in connection with the grant of the leases by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Ozark National Forest, the BLM has discontinued approval of operational permits in the forest, including permits to drill, pending resolution of the litigation.  The Ozark Highlands Unit lies entirely within the Ozark National Forest.  Although the Company is not a party to the litigation and the plaintiffs’ complaints do not seek invalidation of the leases, we currently are unable to obtain permits to drill on the 158,231 acres we have leased in the unit and the national forest.   As of December 31, 2014, we had spud a total of 4,578 wells in the Fayetteville Shale since its commencement in 2004, of which 4,002 were operated by us and 576 were outside-operated wells.  Of these wells, 468 were spud in 2014, 527 in 2013 and 491 in 2012.  All of the wells spud in 2014 were designated as horizontal wells.  At year-end 2014, 3,742 wells operated by the Company had been drilled and completed overall, including 3,651 horizontal wells.  Of the 3,651 horizontal wells, 3,633 wells were fracture stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel stimulation treatments, or a combination thereof.   In 2014, the horizontal wells we drilled as operator had an average completed well cost of $2.6 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 5,440 feet, and an average time to drill to total depth of 6.8 days from re-entry to re-entry, which includes the downtime associated with the delivery and operational start up of seven new rigs which are expected to decrease drilling times in 2015 and beyond as the technological enhancements on these rigs is utilized.  This compares to an average completed operated well cost of $2.4 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 5,356 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 6.2 days from re-entry to re-entry during 2013.  In 2012, our average completed operated well cost was $2.5 million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,833 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 6.7 days from re-entry to re-entry.  The operated wells we placed on production during 2014 averaged initial production rates of 4,430 Mcf per day, compared to average initial production rates of 4,041 Mcf per day in 2013 and 3,629 Mcf per day in 2012.  In 2014 and 2013, our initial production rates increased compared to 2013 and 2012, respectively, as a result of longer lateral lengths, improved well bore placement, and further refined completion and flowback techniques.  During 2014, we placed 145 operated wells on production with initial production rates that exceeded 5.0 MMcf per day, compared to 93 wells in 2013 and 59 wells in 2012.     12       Table of Contents   Our total proved net reserves in the Fayetteville Shale at year-end 2014 were from a total of 5,445 locations, of which 4,045 were proved developed producing, 187 were proved developed non-producing and 1,213 were proved undeveloped.  Of the 5,445 locations, 5,373 were horizontal.  The average gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells included at year-end 2014 was approximately 2.3 Bcf per well, compared to 2.5 Bcf per well at year-end 2013, and 2.8 Bcf per well at year-end 2012.  The decrease in average gross proved reserves for our undeveloped wells in 2014 was primarily due to the addition of proven undeveloped locations in areas of the field with lower estimated ultimate recoveries.  The decrease in average gross proved reserves for our undeveloped wells in 2013 was primarily due to the addition of over 800 proven undeveloped locations with lower estimated ultimate recoveries that were added due to the higher gas price environment. Total proved net natural gas reserves in the Fayetteville Shale in 2013 were approximately 4,795 Bcf from a total of 4,631 locations, of which 3,511 were proved developed producing, 59 were proved developed non-producing and 1,061 were proved undeveloped.  Total proved net natural gas reserves in the Fayetteville Shale in 2012 totaled approximately 2,988 Bcf from a total of 3,508 locations, of which 3,175 were proved developed producing, 123 were proved developed non-producing and 210 were proved undeveloped.   In 2014, we invested approximately $944 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included approximately $838 million to spud 468 wells, 464 of which we operate.  Included in our total capital investments in the Fayetteville Shale during 2014 was $99 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $7 million for acquisition of properties.  In 2013, we invested approximately $907 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included $804 million to spud 527 wells, 504 of which we operate, $97 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $6 million for acquisition of properties.  In 2012, we invested approximately $991 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included $877 million to spud 491 wells, 453 of which we operate, $110 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $4 million for acquisition of properties. As of December 31, 2014, we had acquired approximately 1,324 square miles of 3-D seismic data, which provides us with seismic data on approximately 65% of our net acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale, excluding our acreage in the Arkoma Basin.  In 2015, we plan to invest approximately $560 million in our Fayetteville Shale properties, which includes participating in approximately 225 to 235 gross wells, all of which we plan to operate.   We believe that our Fayetteville Shale acreage continues to have significant development potential.  Our strategy is to continue our development drilling, increase the amount of acreage we hold by production and determine the economic viability of the undrilled portion of our acreage.  Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville Shale properties is flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation methods and well spacing, the extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells in other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas commodity price environment.  As we continue to gather data about the Fayetteville Shale, it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all. We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling plans are subject to change” in  of Part I of this Annual Report.   We believe that our Northeast Appalachia acreage has significant development potential.  Our drilling program with respect to Northeast Appalachia is flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation methods, transportation capacity and well spacing and the natural gas commodity price environment.  As we continue to gather data about Northeast Appalachia, it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all.  We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling plans are subject to change” in  of Part I of this Annual Report.      We believe that our Southwest Appalachia acreage has significant development potential.  Our drilling program with respect to Southwest Appalachia is flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation methods, transportation capacity and well spacing and the natural gas commodity price environment.  As we continue to gather data about Southwest Appalachia, it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all.  We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling plans are subject to change” in  of Part I of this Annual Report.     Sand Wash Basin. In 2014, we acquired approximately 376,497 net acres in northwest Colorado targeting crude oil, NGLs and natural gas contained in the Sand Wash Basin. Testing of the play commenced in the second half of the year with us drilling four vertical wells and one horizontal well. Results have been encouraging to date and we intend to continue to test the play in 2015.  Brown Dense.  In July 2011, we announced that we would begin testing a new unconventional liquids rich play targeting the Brown Dense formation, an unconventional reservoir that ranges in vertical depths from 8,000 to 11,000 feet and appears to be laterally extensive over a large area ranging in thickness from 300 to 550 feet.  As of December 31, 2014, we held approximately 304,371 net acres in the area, obtained at an average cost of $831 per acre.  Our leases currently have an approximate 81% average net revenue interest and an average primary lease term of approximately three years, which may be extended for approximately three to four additional years.  As of December 31, 2014, we had drilled 14 operated wells in the area, 6 of which were currently producing.  Late in 2014, the Company acquired 75 miles of 3-D seismic data and is currently in the process of analyzing that data and our results to date.  New Brunswick, Canada.  In March 2010, we successfully bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of New Brunswick to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,518 net acres in the province in order to test new hydrocarbon basins.  As a condition under our licenses, we are required to make investments of approximately $47 million Canadian dollars in the province by March 2015. In order to obtain the licenses, we provided promissory notes payable on demand to the Minister of Finance of the Province of New Brunswick with an aggregate principal amount of $45 million Canadian dollars. The promissory notes secure our capital expenditure obligations under the licenses and are returnable to us to the extent we perform such obligations. If we fail to fully perform, the Minister of Finance may retain a portion of the applicable promissory notes in an amount equal to any deficiency. Through December 31, 2014, we have invested approximately $45 million Canadian dollars, or $44 million USD, in our New Brunswick exploration program toward our commitment, fully covering the promissory notes held by the Province of New Brunswick.    15       Table of Contents   Our licenses are scheduled to expire in March 2015. The newly elected provincial government in New Brunswick recently announced an intent to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until a list of conditions is met and has introduced authorizing legislation in the provincial legislature. We have applied for an extension of our licenses past the end of the moratorium, but as of this time that extension has not been granted. The list of conditions that the provincial government has announced is subjective, and we cannot predict the duration of the moratorium or whether we will be granted the extension requested or any other extension. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted and our licenses are extended, we will not be able to continue with our program in New Brunswick. If this extension is not granted, we may be required to write off our investment.  Acquisitions  In December 2014, we acquired approximately 413,000 net acres in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania with plans to target the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales for approximately $5.0 billion.  Additionally, in January 2015, we acquired an additional approximate 30,000 net acres in this area for $365 million.      Also, in January 2015, we acquired approximately 46,700 net acres in northeast Pennsylvania for $288 million. As part of this transaction, we also received firm transportation capacity of 260 million cubic feet per day predominately on the Millennium pipeline.  In March 2014 and July 2014, we acquired approximately 380,000 net acres in northwest Colorado principally in the Sand Wash basin for approximately $215 million.  In April 2013, we acquired approximately 162,000 net acres in Northeast Appalachia for approximately $82 million.  The acquired acreage is near our existing acreage in Northeast Appalachia.   Capital Investments  During 2014, we invested a total of approximately $7.3 billion in our E&P business and participated in drilling 576 wells, 280 of which were successful and 296 of which were in progress at year-end.  Of the 296 wells in progress at year-end, 224 and 71 were located in our Fayetteville Shale and Northeast Appalachia operating areas, respectively. Additionally, we had 42 wells in progress in Southwest Appalachia at the end of 2014. Of the approximately $7.3 billion invested in our E&P business in 2014, approximately $944 million was invested in the Fayetteville Shale, $695 million in Northeast Appalachia, $5.0 billion in Southwest Appalachia, $2 million in East Texas, $3 million in our conventional Arkoma Basin program and $493 million in New Ventures projects, which includes $115 million in the Brown Dense and $288 million in the Sand Wash Basin.  Of the $7.3 billion invested in 2014, approximately $1.5 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $5.3 billion for acquisition of properties, $247 million in capitalized interest and other expenses and $56 million for seismic expenditures.  Additionally, we invested approximately $105 million in our drilling rigs and related equipment, sand facility and other equipment, and $5 million in pond and water facilities.  In 2013, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in our primary E&P business activities and participated in drilling 653 wells. Of the $2.1 billion invested in 2013, approximately $1.5 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $224 million in capitalized interest and other expenses, $159 million for acquisition of properties, and $28 million for seismic expenditures.  Additionally, we invested approximately $76 million in our drilling rigs and related equipment, sand facility and other equipment, and $18 million in pond and water facilities.  In 2012, we invested approximately $1.9 billion in our primary E&P business activities and participated in drilling 595 wells.  Of the $1.9 billion invested in 2012, approximately $1.4 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $186 million for acquisition of properties, $10 million for seismic expenditures and $254 million in capitalized interest and other expenses.  Additionally, we invested approximately $15 million in our drilling rig related equipment, sand facility and other equipment.     In 2015, excluding the capital associated with the closing of the WPX and Statoil Property Acquisitions, we plan to invest approximately $1.9 billion in our E&P program and participate in drilling 363 to 382 gross wells, the vast majority of which will be operated by us.  The Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia will be the primary focus of our capital investments, with planned investments of approximately $560, $700, and $520 million, respectively.  Our planned 2015 capital investments also include approximately $110 million in the Sand Wash Basin, the Brown Dense and other New Ventures projects.  Of the $1.9 billion allocated to our 2015 E&P capital budget, approximately $1.4 billion currently is planned to be invested in development and exploratory drilling, $17 million in seismic and other geological and geophysical expenditures, $72 million in acquisition of properties and $391 million in capitalized interest and expenses as well as equipment, facilities and technology-related expenditures. Additionally, we plan to invest $31 million in our E&P services which support our E&P operations. The planned capital program for 2015 is flexible and can be modified.  We will    16       Table of Contents   reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions and, if natural gas prices are challenged in 2015, we could change our planned investments.  We refer you to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Investments” within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the factors that could impact our planned capital investments in 2015.  Sales, Delivery Commitments and Customers  Sales. Our daily natural gas equivalent production averaged 2,105 MMcfe in 2014, compared to 1,800 MMcfe in 2013 and 1,544 MMcfe in 2012.  Total natural gas equivalent production was 768 Bcfe in 2014, up from 657 Bcfe in 2013 and 565 Bcfe in 2012.  Our natural gas production was 766 Bcf in 2014, compared to 656 Bcf in 2013 and 565 Bcf in 2012.  The increase in production in 2014 resulted primarily from a 103 Bcf increase in net production from our Northeast Appalachia properties, a 3 Bcfe increase in net production from our Southwest Appalachia properties, and an 8 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 3 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties.  The increase in production in 2013 resulted primarily from a 97 Bcf increase in net production from our Northeast Appalachia properties, a 1 Bcfe increase in net production from our New Ventures properties, and a 1 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 7 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties. We produced 235,000 barrels of oil in 2014, compared to 138,000 barrels of oil in 2013 and 83,000 barrels of oil in 2012.  Our oil production has increased between 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the acquisition of oil and gas properties in Southwest Appalachia and our exploration activities in the Brown Dense.  In 2014, we produced 231,000 barrels of NGLs, compared to 50,000 barrels of NGLs in 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of oil and gas properties in West Virginia and our exploration activities in the Brown Dense.  For 2015, we are targeting total net natural gas, oil and NGL production of approximately 940 to 955 Bcfe, which represents a growth rate of approximately 23% over our 2014 production volumes, using midpoints.  Sales of natural gas and oil production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings.  We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production.  We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. As of December 31, 2014, we had New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, commodity price hedges in place on 240 Bcf, or approximately 27% of our targeted 2015 natural gas production.  We intend to hedge additional future production volumes to the extent natural gas prices rise to levels that we believe will achieve certain desired levels of cash flow.  We refer you to Item 7A of this Annual Report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,” for further information regarding our hedge position as of December 31, 2014.  Including the effect of hedges, we realized an average wellhead price of $3.72 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2014, compared to $3.65 per Mcf in 2013 and $3.44 per Mcf in 2012. Our hedging activities decreased our average realized natural gas sales price by $0.02 per Mcf in 2014, compared to increases of $0.48 per Mcf in 2013 and $1.10 per Mcf in 2012.  Our average oil price realized was $79.91 per barrel in 2014, compared to $103.32 per barrel in 2013 and $101.54 per barrel in 2012. Our average realized NGL price was $15.72 per barrel in 2014 compared to $43.63 per barrel in 2013. None of our oil or NGL production was hedged during 2014, 2013 or 2012.  During 2014, the average price received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of hedges, was approximately $0.67 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX prices.  Differences between NYMEX and price realized are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2015 of $3.25 per Mcf of natural gas, we expect to receive an average sales price for our natural gas production $0.70 to $0.85 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub average monthly settlement price, including the impact of financial basis hedges. This discount to NYMEX includes average third-party transportation charges in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the range of .50% to 1.0% of our sales price for natural gas and basis differential. As of December 31, 2014, we have attempted to mitigate the volatility of basis differentials by protecting basis on approximately 292 Bcf and 139 Bcf of our 2015 and 2016 production, respectively, and expected natural gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas prices of approximately ($0.13) per Mcf and ($0.08) per Mcf for 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2014, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 452 Bcf in 2015 and 194 Bcf in 2016 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our forecasted 2015 natural gas production of approximately 875 to 890 Bcf from our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia divisions and anticipated 2016 production from our available reserves in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest    17       Table of Contents   Appalachia divisions, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our ability to meet our contractual obligations other than those discussed in  of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.  Midstream Services  We believe our Midstream Services segment is well-positioned to complement our E&P initiatives and to compete with other midstream providers for unaffiliated business.  We generate revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of natural gas.  Our gathering assets support our E&P    18       Table of Contents   operations and are currently concentrated in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and Northeast Appalachia in Pennsylvania. We plan to divest our Northeast Appalachia gathering assets in 2015.   Our operating income from this segment was $361 million on revenues of $4.4 billion in 2014, compared to $325 million on revenues of $3.3 billion in 2013 and $294 million on revenues of $2.4 billion in 2012.  Revenues increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to an increase in the prices received for volumes marketed and an increase in volumes marketed. Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Midstream Services segment was $418 million in 2014, compared to $377 million in 2013 and $339 million in 2012.  The increases in 2014 and 2013 operating income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily due to increased gathering revenues, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a table that reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).    Gas Gathering  We engage in gas gathering activities primarily in Arkansas related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale asset and in Pennsylvania related to the development of our Northeast Appalachia asset.  In 2014, we invested approximately $144 million related to these activities and had gathering revenues of $562 million, compared to $158 million invested and revenues of $516 million in 2013 and $165 million invested and revenues of $474 million in 2012.      We continue to expand our network of gathering lines and facilities throughout the Fayetteville Shale area. During 2014, we gathered approximately 812 Bcf of natural gas in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 62 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells.  During 2013, we gathered approximately 790 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 62 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells.  In 2012, we gathered approximately 781 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 56 Bcf of natural gas from third-party wells. At the end of 2014, we had approximately 2,017 miles of pipe from the individual wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 590,975 horsepower had been installed at 63 central point gathering facilities in the Fayetteville Shale.    We also engage in gathering activities in Pennsylvania, Louisiana and East Texas. During 2014, we gathered approximately 151 Bcf of natural gas volumes in Northeast Appalachia, Louisiana and East Texas.  During 2013, we gathered approximately 110 Bcf of natural gas in Northeast Appalachia and East Texas.  In 2012, we gathered approximately 65 Bcf of natural gas in Northeast Appalachia and East Texas.  The increase in volumes gathered over the past three years was primarily due to our growing production volumes in Northeast Appalachia.  At year-end 2014, we had approximately 105 miles of pipe in Pennsylvania, 25 miles of pipe in Texas and 16 miles of pipe in Louisiana.  As of December 31, 2014, compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 53,035 horsepower had also been installed at 4 central point gathering facilities in Pennsylvania. We plan to divest of our Northeast Appalachia gathering assets in 2015.  Gas Marketing  We attempt to capture downstream opportunities related to marketing and transportation of natural gas. Our current marketing strategy primarily involves the marketing of our own natural gas production.  Additionally, we manage portfolio and basis risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas.  During 2014, we marketed 904 Bcf of natural gas, compared to 800 Bcf in 2013 and 676 Bcf in 2012.  Of the total volumes marketed, production from our affiliated E&P operations accounted for 97% in 2014, compared to 96% in 2013 and 95% in 2012.  Fayetteville Shale Marketing  We are a “foundation shipper” on two pipeline projects serving the Fayetteville Shale.  The Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, or FEP, is a 2.0 Bcf per day pipeline that is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.  FEP was placed in service in January 2011.  We have a maximum aggregate commitment of approximately 1,200,000 Dekatherms per day for an initial term of ten years from the in-service date.  Texas Gas Transmission, LLC or Texas Gas, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, constructed two pipeline laterals called the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, which also provide transportation for our Fayetteville Shale gas.  We have maximum aggregate commitments of approximately 800,000 Mcf per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 Mcf per day on the Greenville Lateral.  The Fayetteville and the Greenville Laterals and the FEP allow us to transport our natural gas to interconnecting pipelines that offer connectivity and marketing options to the eastern half of the United States.  These interconnecting pipelines include Centerpoint, Natural Gas Pipeline, Mississippi River Transmission, Gulf South, Texas Gas, Tennessee    19       Table of Contents   Gas Pipeline, Trunkline, ANR, Columbia Gulf, Texas Eastern, and Sonat.  We rely in part upon the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals and the FEP to service our production from the Fayetteville Shale.      Northeast Appalachia  During 2011 and 2012, we entered into a number of short- and long-term firm transportation service agreements in support of our growing Northeast Appalachia operations in Pennsylvania. In March 2011, we entered into a precedent agreement with Millennium Pipeline Company, L.L.C. pursuant to which we entered into short- and long-term firm natural gas transportation services on Millennium’s existing system. Expansions of the system were placed in-service in the second quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014.  We have also executed firm transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (“TGP”), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., that increase our ability to move our Northeast Appalachia natural gas production in the short term to market as well as a precedent agreement for an expansion project that was placed in-service in November 2013 pursuant to which SES has subscribed for approximately 100,000 Dekatherms per day of capacity.  TGP’s expansion project will expand its 300 Line in Pennsylvania to provide natural gas transportation from the northeast Appalachia supply area to existing delivery points on the TGP system.   In March 2012, we entered into a precedent agreement with Constitution Pipeline Co. LLC for a proposed 121-mile pipeline connecting to the Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, New York. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions, we agreed to enter a 15-year firm transportation agreement with a total capacity of approximately 150,000 Mcf per day on this project.  Constitution Pipeline Co. LLC has extended the range for the pipeline’s target in-service date to late 2015 through 2016 as a result of a longer than expected regulatory and permitting process. We have provided certain guarantees of a portion of our obligations under these agreements.  In May 2013, we entered into a precedent agreement with Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC for a project that will expand their existing system from Chester County, Pennsylvania to various interconnects throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.  Our volume on this project is 72,000 Mcf per day and it is expected to be in service by the third quarter of 2015.         In January 2014, we entered into a precedent agreement with Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company LLC that will provide additional firm transportation capacity for supplies of natural gas from northern Pennsylvania to  markets along the Transco pipeline system stretching from the northeastern US in Transco’s Zone 6, to Zone 5 and terminating in Zone 4.  Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions, we agreed to enter a 15-year firm transportation agreement with a total capacity of approximately 44,000 Mcf per day on this project and is expected to be in service in the second half of 2017.  In January 2015, we completed the purchase of certain oil and gas assets in northeast Pennsylvania and assumed short and long-term natural gas transportation agreements with Millennium Pipeline Company, L.L.C. with a total capacity of approximately 260,000 Mcf per day.   Southwest Appalachia  As part of our December 2014 acquisition of oil and gas assets in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania, we were assigned approximately 92,000 Mcf per day of capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline. Additionally, we were assigned a precedent agreement with ET Rover Pipeline LLC for approximately 200,000 Mcf per day of capacity.  ET Rover Pipeline LLC is constructing a new interstate pipeline to receive and transport natural gas from Marcellus and Utica production outlets to points of interconnection with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company and ANR Pipeline, to interconnections in Michigan, to the Union Gas Dawn Hub and to certain off-system delivery points on Trunkline Zone 1A, and is anticipated to be in service by the second quarter 2017.  In addition to the December 2014 assignment of natural gas transportation agreements, we were assigned certain ethane transportation agreements that allow for the transport of our ethane production to both domestic and international markets.      Demand Charges  As of December 31, 2014,  our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately $5.4 billion and the Company has guarantee obligations of up to $173 million of that amount.        20       Table of Contents   We refer you to the risk factor “If our Fayetteville Shale and Northeast Appalachia drilling programs fail to produce our projected supply of natural gas, the value of our investments in our gathering operations could be diminished.  In addition, our commitments for transportation on third-party pipelines and gathering systems could make the sale of our natural gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows.  Competition  Our gas gathering and marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users.  Regulation  The transportation and sale of natural gas and oil are heavily regulated.  Interstate pipelines must obtain authorization from the FERC, to operate in interstate commerce, and state governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service.  The FERC currently allows interstate pipelines to adopt market-based rates; however, in the past the FERC has regulated pipeline tariffs and could do so again in the future.  State tariff regulations vary.  Currently, all our pipelines are intrastate.  State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market.  In addition, various suppliers of goods and services to our midstream business may require licensing.  The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation.  We refer you to “Other — Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in  of Part I of this Annual Report.  Employee health and safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.  Canada. Our activities in Canada have, to date, been limited to certain geological and geophysical activities that are not subject to extensive environmental regulation. If and when we begin drilling and development activities in New Brunswick, we will be subject to federal, provincial and local environmental regulations that we believe require compliance efforts comparable to those required in the United States.  Employees  As of December 31, 2014, we had 2,781 total employees. None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end 2014.  We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.  In 2014, we were named a Top Workplace by the Houston Chronicle for the fifth consecutive year.     24       Table of Contents   GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN INDUSTRY TERMS  The definitions set forth below apply to the indicated terms as used in this Annual Report.

The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economic flow rates.  “Undeveloped acreage”  Those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. For additional information, see the SEC's definition in Item 1208(c)(4) of Regulation S-K, a link for which is available at the SEC's website.  “Undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves”  Undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.  Also referred to as “undeveloped reserves.”  For additional information, see the SEC’s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (31) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC’s website.  “Undeveloped reserves”  See “undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves.”     28       Table of Contents   “USD”  United States Dollar.  “Well spacing”  The regulation of the number and location of wells over an oil or natural gas reservoir, as a conservation measure.  Well spacing is normally accomplished by order of the regulatory conservation commission in the applicable jurisdiction.  The order may be statewide in its application (subject to change for local conditions) or it may be entered for each field after its discovery. In the operational context, “well spacing” refers to the area attributable between producing wells within the scope of what is permitted under a regulatory order.  “Working interest”   An operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and to receive a share of production.  “Workovers”   Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.  “WTI”   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark oil price in the United States.      29       Table of Contents   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.  The risk factors described below represent what we believe are the most significant risk factors with respect to us and our business.  In assessing the risks relating to our business, investors should also read the other information included in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements.”  Our revenues and the value of our assets are highly dependent on the prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil.  These prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us.  Our financial results and the value of our assets correlate closely to the prices we can and do obtain for what we produce, in particular natural gas, which historically has accounted for almost 100% of our production.  Prices for natural gas and oil are highly volatile and unpredictable.  The following factors, among others, affect the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil:        ·     Changes in consumption patterns, including those resulting from population changes and migrations, new technologies and grown in emerging markets       ·     Global and local economic conditions       ·     Inventory  levels       ·     Ability and cost of transporting product to markets, including the ability to connect resources to pipelines or other means of transportation, bottlenecks in pipeline or other transportation capacity such as many are experiencing in the Marcellus and the Utica Shales, export and import controls and other constraints       ·     Production  disruptions       ·     Actions of governments and multinational groups, such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)       ·     Currency exchange rates       ·     Competition from other producers and from other energy sources, including renewables, which affects the level of supply       ·     Technological developments       ·     Weather, earthquakes and other natural events       ·     Market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others A significant or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices, such as the one from 2008 into 2012 when the NYMEX natural gas price dropped from $13.58 to $1.91 per MMBtu, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically, including the following:        ·     The cash flows from our operations would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital investments employed to replace reserves or increase production.       ·     Lower prices would reduce the value of our natural gas and oil assets and, in some cases, make them no longer be economic to produce.  This could result in impairments to the values of our assets, such as occurred in 2012.       ·     Access to other sources of capital, such as equity or debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable.       ·     We could fail to meet financial or other covenants in the documentation governing our debt, leading to mandatory prepayments or defaults.       ·     Locational price differentials change, making it difficult to predict the best locations to conduct our activities.       ·     Varying perceptions of future prices can lead to difficulties in agreeing on the value of assets in acquisitions or dispositions. We endeavor to mitigate against these risks through hedging a significant portion of our production.  Hedging also presents risks, including our failure to project the appropriate volumes and price points for hedges and the creditworthiness of our counterparties.  For a discussion of our hedging activities, we refer you to Note 5 to the consolidated financial    30       Table of Contents   statements included in this Annual Report.  Additionally, we mitigate these risks, in part, through our Midstream Services business, which generates cash flow that is largely fee-based and thus not directly impacted by commodity price volatility.  Our ability to sell our natural gas and oil and/or to receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by constraints or interruptions on gathering systems, pipelines, processing and transportation systems owned or operated by us or others.  The marketability of our natural gas and oil production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering systems, processing and pipeline and other transportation systems owned or operated by third parties. The lack of available capacity in these systems and facilities can result in shutting in producing wells, delaying or discontinuing the development plans for our properties or receiving lower prices. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation and gathering of our production, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints, and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather, and transport natural gas. In particular, continued development in the Appalachian Basin by us and others could overtax the capacity of existing gathering and pipeline system, and new or expanded capacity may not be in place in time.   The vast majority of our current operations and production are in the Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia, and significant events or circumstances affecting one or more of these areas could have a material and adverse effect on our operations in those areas and thus our overall performance.  Production from the Fayetteville Shale and Northeast Appalachia accounted for 64% and 33%, respectively, of our consolidated production and, when considering both our E&P and Midstream Services business, essentially all of our operating income in 2014.  Our current Fayetteville Shale operations are almost entirely in Arkansas, and our current Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia operations currently are only in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Significant events or circumstances of the types described elsewhere in these Risk Factors or otherwise that affect one or more of these areas would affect a very large part of our operations simultaneously and, even if they do not affect the industry generally, would affect us disproportionately compared to other companies.  Those events and circumstances include changes in local laws and regulations, constraints on transportation, natural events, localized price changes and availability of water, skilled personnel, equipment, services and supplies, among others.  If we fail to find or acquire additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels.  The rate of production from natural gas and oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.  Unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, successfully apply new technologies or identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced.  Future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.  Our business could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.   The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses and concessions, marketing agreements, transportation, equipment and labor against companies with financial and other resources substantially larger than those we possess.  Many of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.  Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.  In addition, many of our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer time than we have or have established strategic long-term positions in geographic regions in which we may seek new entry.  Natural gas and oil exploration and production is an inherently risky business with many uncertainties and potential liabilities.  The results of our activities may not be what we project, and not all our liabilities and other exposures may be covered by insurance.  By its nature, exploring for and producing natural gas and oil involves substantial capital investment with no assurance of return, or returns at expected levels, and the risk of environmental and other liability.  Among other things:        ·     Although we utilize sophisticated geological and geophysical tools to determine where to drill, these do not    31       Table of Contents      predict with certainty the presence of natural gas or oil or the rate at which they can be produced.  Some wells will result in no production, production that does not cover costs or production at lower levels than expected.       ·     During drilling we can face difficulties in landing our wellbore in the desired zones, staying in the desired zones while drilling horizontally, penetrating rock formations, controlling well pressure, stimulating reservoirs through fracturing and cleaning the wellbore following fracturing and running casing the entire length of the wellbore.  These circumstances can delay completion, increase costs and possibly lead to the abandonment of the particular location.       ·     When we acquire properties or businesses through acquisitions, including properties already producing, we may fail to assess correctly the potential of the properties, the costs of integration and development, matters affecting legal title and thus the right to drill and ownership of production, the liabilities that we assume as part of the acquisition and the risks associated with ownership, development and operation.       ·     Equipment can fail or not be available and pipelines can rupture.       ·     We can encounter well blowouts, cratering, explosions, pipeline failure, fires, brine or other fluids, drainage of production from neighboring properties and other hazards.       ·     Earthquakes and hurricanes, storms and other weather events can interfere with drilling activities and operations.       ·     Although we believe we maintain a robust health, safety and environmental program, incidents can occur, whether due to natural events, the actions of third parties or our own errors or oversights.  Spills, injuries or other calamities can result in liability for our Company, damage to our properties and interruption of our operations. We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks; for example, we generally do not maintain business interruption insurance, and pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  These risks could give rise to significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial results.  Our business strategy depends on executing extensive drilling programs and controlling costs to improve our overall return.  Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies, raw materials and qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to implement our programs or to achieve our desired levels of costs.  We are engaged in large-scale programs to develop our assets, particularly in the Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia.  We are achieving economies of scale through our sizeable operations in these two areas and, in some cases, vertical integration in certain oilfield services, such as drilling, sand mining and pressure control.  We nonetheless compete with other companies for oilfield equipment, services, supplies, raw materials and qualified personnel.  In particular, the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services, personnel and raw materials (such as sand, cement, manufactured proppants and other materials utilized in the provision of the oilfield services).  Higher natural gas and oil prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased costs for professional personnel, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.  In addition, our E&P operations also require local access to large quantities of water supplies and disposal services for produced water in connection with our hydraulic fracture stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs. We cannot be certain when we will experience shortages or cost increases, which could adversely affect our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations.  Our announced drilling plans can change due to various factors.  As of December 31, 2014, we had drilled and completed 3,742 operated wells relating to our Fayetteville Shale play and 277 operated wells relating to Northeast Appalachia. At year-end 2014, after the exclusion of our acreage in the traditional Fairway and the approximately 158,000 net federal acres we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit, approximately 85% of our leasehold acreage in the Fayetteville Shale was held by production. Approximately 23% and 54% of our leasehold acreage in Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia was held by production at year-end 2014, respectively. Our drilling plans are flexible and are dependent upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful wells in addition to the natural gas and oil commodity price environment. The determination as to whether we continue to drill wells in our operating areas may depend on any one or more of the following factors:     32       Table of Contents         ·     our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation;       ·     our ability to transport our production to the most favorable markets;        ·     material changes in natural gas prices (including regional basis differentials);       ·     changes in the costs to drill, complete or operate wells and our ability to reduce drilling risks;       ·     the extent of our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells;       ·     the costs and availability of oilfield personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment services       ·     success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations of which would use the same production facilities;       ·     receipt of additional seismic or other geologic data or reprocessing of existing data;       ·     the extent to which we are able to effectively operate our own drilling rigs;       ·     availability and cost of capital; or       ·     the impact of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in severance taxes.  We continue to gather data about our prospects in our operating areas, and it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all.  Our ability to produce natural gas and oil could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.  Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our E&P operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas.  Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.  Our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States and elsewhere relating to environmental matters, particularly hydraulic fracturing and climate change, which could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays or prevent us from realizing the value of undeveloped acreage.  As described more fully under “Other — Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation.  New regulations can increase costs or delay or prevent us from achieving our goals.  In particular, we often utilize hydraulic fracturing in our drilling activities, and it forms a critical part of our cost structure and success.  As also described there, various governmental and non-governmental groups are advocating restrictions and, in some instances, outright bans on the use of hydraulic fracturing.    Our E&P operations are currently focused on the production of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, and we expect to continue to focus on such resources in the future. The production of hydrocarbons from these sources has an energy intensity that is a number of times higher than that for production from conventional sources. Therefore, we expect that the greenhouse gas intensity of our production will increase in the long-term. We actively seek to reduce the environmental impact of our operations by pursuing more efficient use of natural resources such as hydrocarbons and water and managing and mitigating the emissions to the air, water and soil, with a focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. With the efforts of our Health, Safety and Environmental Department, we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy. We anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment that will increase the cost of equipment, materials and services whose production utilizes hydrocarbons. We may also face increased competition from alternative energy sources that do not rely on hydrocarbons. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters and if we are unable to find solutions to environmental initiatives as they arise, including reducing the greenhouse gas emissions for our existing projects, we may have additional costs as well as compliance and operational risks with respect to our existing operations as well as facing difficulties in pursuing new projects.       33       Table of Contents   Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates are only estimates and thus may prove to be inaccurate.  As described in more detail under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Natural Gas and Oil Properties” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly, however, and our estimates of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves, along with pricing.   Recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital investments and successful drilling operations.  Actual reserves, costs and prices may differ dramatically from our estimates.  Our operations can be impacted by events beyond our control, adversely affecting our cash flows and results of operations.  A portion of our production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, earthquakes, accidents, loss of pipeline, gathering, processing or transportation system access or capacity, field labor issues or strikes or voluntarily curtailment in response to market conditions. Further, although we operate most of the wells in which we have interests, some are operated by third parties.  Although we endeavor to assure that third parties conduct their activities with rigorous regard for health, safety, environment and cost, we do not control them and therefore cannot be sure they will operate to the same standards that we would.  If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Counterparties to contracts, whether those providing us with goods or services or those owing us payments for production or services, may breach their obligations.  We may have difficulty financing our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth.  We have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital investment and working capital needs to implement our drilling program.  Our planned capital investments for 2015 are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations under current natural gas prices.  We expect to be able to borrow under our revolving credit facility to fund capital investments to the extent they exceed our net cash flow and cash on hand.  Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to certain conditions.  As of December 31, 2014, we would satisfy those conditions; however, if conditions were not satisfied and we were not otherwise able to borrow funds, we would need to curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on a possibly unfavorable basis.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations.  We have made significant investments in pipelines and gathering systems and contracts and in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rig, pressure pumping equipment and sand mine operations, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production.  If our exploration and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations.  In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.   Through December 31, 2014, we had invested approximately $1,184 million in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale and approximately $247 million in our gas gathering system built for our operations in Northeast Appalachia.  To the extent necessary to gather our production, we may make further substantial investments in the expansion of our gas gathering systems.  We have also entered into multiple firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes produced from the Fayetteville Shale as well as a number of firm transportation and gathering agreements relating to the Marcellus Shale. As of December 31, 2014, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately $5.4 billion. Our gas gathering business will largely rely on natural gas sourced from our operations.  If our Fayetteville Shale and Northeast Appalachia programs fail to produce significant quantities of natural gas within expected timeframes, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost, and we could be forced to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems that we would not be using.  We also have made significant investments to meet certain of our oilfield services needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, sand mine and pressure pumping capability.  If our level of operations is reduced, we may not be able to recover these investments.  Further, entering into these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers.     34       Table of Contents   Our drilling plans are subject to change.  As of December 31, 2014, we had drilled and completed 3,742 operated wells relating to our Fayetteville Shale play and 277 operated wells relating to Northeast Appalachia. At year-end 2014, after the exclusion of our acreage in the traditional Fairway and the approximately 158,000 net federal acres we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit, approximately 85% of our leasehold acreage in the Fayetteville Shale was held by production. Approximately 23% and 54% of our leasehold acreage in Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia was held by production at year-end 2014, respectively. Our drilling plans are flexible and are dependent upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful wells in addition to the natural gas and oil commodity price environment. The determination as to whether we continue to drill wells in our operating areas may depend on any one or more of the following factors:        ·     our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation;       ·     our ability to transport our production to the most favorable markets;        ·     material changes in natural gas prices (including regional basis differentials);       ·     changes in the costs to drill, complete or operate wells and our ability to reduce drilling risks;       ·     the extent of our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells;       ·     the costs and availability of oilfield personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment services       ·     success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations of which would use the same production facilities;       ·     receipt of additional seismic or other geologic data or reprocessing of existing data;       ·     the extent to which we are able to effectively operate our own drilling rigs;       ·     availability and cost of capital; or       ·     the impact of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in severance taxes. We continue to gather data about our prospects in our operating areas, and it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all.  If we fail to drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our acreage, the lease terms could expire, which would result in the loss of certain leasehold rights.  Leases on approximately 175,220 (including 158,231 net acres held on federal lands which are currently suspended by the Bureau of Land Management) net acres of our Fayetteville Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases.  Approximately 133,624 and 131,782 net acres of our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases.  As discussed above under “Our drilling plans are subject to change,” our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control.  With the exception of the Ozark Highlands Unit, which is leased from the Federal Government, the current rules in Arkansas relating to the Fayetteville Shale provide that each drilling unit would consist of a governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators are permitted to drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of supply.  In Pennsylvania, the location of our Northeast Appalachia acreage, there are currently no rules establishing requirements for drilling units.  In West Virginia, where the bulk of our Southwest Appalachia acreage is located, there is no procedure to compel holders of neighboring interests to join into units. Current rules in these states may change in ways that could impair our ability to drill or maintain our acreage position.  In addition, other E&P operator drilling activity could impair our ability to drill and maintain acreage positions.  To the extent that any field rules prevent us from successfully drilling wells in certain areas, we may not be able to drill the wells required to maintain our leasehold rights and our leasehold investments could be lost.  We depend upon our management team and our operations require us to attract and retain experienced technical personnel.   The successful implementation of our business strategy and handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy depends, in part, on our experienced management team, as well as certain key geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals employed by us.  The success of our technological initiatives that support our business enterprise is also dependent upon attracting and retaining experienced technical professionals.  The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.     35       Table of Contents    Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.  The elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies has been proposed in recent years. These changes have included, among other proposals:        ·     Repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties       ·     Elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs       ·     Elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities       ·     Extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted. The passage of these or any similar changes in federal income tax laws to eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Cyber attacks or terrorist attacks could affect our assets, cash flows and results of operations.  Cyber attacks on businesses are occurring with greater frequency, and natural gas and oil infrastructure and systems could become targets of terrorists.  We rely on electronic systems and networks to control and manage our exploration and production, pipeline and marketing operations and have multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.  We also have security in place around our physical operations. If we nonetheless were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our businesses and the communities in which they operate could be significant.  Our Canadian exploration and production activities are subject to different risks and uncertainties, different from or in addition to those we face in our U.S. operations.  In addition to the various risks associated with our U.S. operations, we are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our Canadian exploration and production activities, including risks related to increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, restrictions on imports and exports, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities in Canada could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, the rights of aboriginal peoples, called First Nations in Canada, are not clear.  Our operations in New Brunswick have been subject to local protests, causing several temporary interruptions to our exploration activities. In addition, the newly elected provincial government in New Brunswick recently announced an intent to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until a list of conditions is met and has introduced authorizing legislation in the provincial legislature. We have applied for an extension of our licenses past the end of the moratorium, but as of this time that extension has not been granted. The list of conditions that the provincial government has announced is subjective, and we cannot predict the duration of the moratorium or whether we will be granted the extension requested or any other extension. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted and our licenses are extended, we will not be able to continue with our program in New Brunswick.  Because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors in our common stock must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.  We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings and other cash resources, if any, for the operation and development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansions. Any future dividends on our common stock may also be restricted by any loan agreements which we may enter into from time to time and from the future issuances of preferred stock. However, until the depositary shares representing the 1/20th interest in our 6.25% Series B Mandatory Preferred Stock convert to common stock, we will pay quarterly dividends to the holders of such depositary shares.     36       Table of Contents    Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our board of directors of a stockholder rights plan could prevent a takeover, which could harm our stockholders.  Our current and future levels of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.  At December 31, 2014, we had long-term indebtedness of $2.5 billion, including borrowings of $300 million under our revolving credit facility and $500 million under our Term Loan Facility. Also at December 31, 2014, we had short-term indebtedness of $4.5 billion relating to our bridge facility which was repaid in full in January 2015 in part through the issuance of $2.2 billion of additional long-term senior notes. See Note 16 – Subsequent Events within Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on indebtedness incurred subsequent to December 31, 2014.  The terms of the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the master lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs and other equipment, which we collectively refer to as our “financing agreements,” impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following:        ·     incurring additional debt;       ·     redeeming stock or redeeming debt;       ·     making investments;       ·     creating liens on our assets; and       ·     selling assets.  Although the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that apply to us, covenants limiting liens and sale and leasebacks covenants contain exceptions and limitations that would allow us, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, to create, grant or incur certain liens or security interests. Moreover, the indenture does not contain any limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, make investments, or limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. Such activities may, however, be limited by our other financing agreements in certain circumstances.  Our level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:        ·     requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;       ·     limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;       ·     limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and       ·     detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally. Our ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.  If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under the notes or our other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, loss of use of our drilling rigs. In particular, a significant or extended decline in natural gas or oil prices would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically. For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, natural gas prices traded at a high of $5.56 in February 2014 and a low of $3.73 in November 2014 based on last-day-of-month settlement. We may not have sufficient funds to make such payments. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure    37       Table of Contents   you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure you that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.  A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.  Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our corporate borrowing costs. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. Although we are currently rated “investment grade,” there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.  We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, including the Acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.  We have consummated several acquisitions and we periodically evaluate other potential acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of properties, including the Acquisitions, requires an assessment of several factors, including:        ·     recoverable reserves;       ·     future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;       ·     availability and cost of transportation of production to markets;       ·     availability and cost of drilling equipment and of skilled personnel;       ·     development and operating costs and potential environments and other liabilities;       ·     regulatory, permitting and similar matters; and       ·     our ability to obtain external financing to fund the purchase price.  The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an “as is” basis, and, as is the case with certain liabilities associated with the assets to be acquired, we are entitled to indemnification for only certain environmental liabilities. In addition, we waived or did not include certain environmental and title indemnification in our acquisitions in Southwest Appalachia in exchange for downward adjustments to the purchase prices.  Significant acquisitions, including the Acquisitions, and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:        ·     diversion of our management’s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;       ·     the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;       ·     difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate assets;       ·     the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations; and       ·     the failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.      38       Table of Contents    ITEM 1B
