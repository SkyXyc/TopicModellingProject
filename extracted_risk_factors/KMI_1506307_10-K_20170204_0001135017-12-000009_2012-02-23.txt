Texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country.  The natural gas demand profile in the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial (including on-site cogeneration facilities), merchant and utility power, and local natural gas distribution consumption.  The industrial demand is primarily year-round load.  Merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months.

 

Collectively, the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system primarily serves the Texas Gulf Coast by selling, transporting, processing and treating natural gas from multiple onshore and offshore supply sources to serve the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur/Austin industrial markets, local natural gas distribution utilities, electric utilities and merchant power generation markets.  It serves as a buyer and seller of natural gas, as well as a transporter of natural gas.  In 2011, the four natural gas pipeline systems in the Texas intrastate group provided an average of approximately 2.23 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas transport services.  The Texas intrastate group also sold approximately 804.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2011.

 

The purchases and sales of natural gas are primarily priced with reference to market prices in the consuming region of the system.  The difference between the purchase and sale prices is the rough equivalent of a transportation fee and fuel costs.  Generally, KMP purchases natural gas directly from producers with reserves connected to its intrastate natural gas system in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  In addition, the Texas intrastate group also purchases gas at interconnects with third-party interstate and intrastate pipelines.  While the Texas intrastate group does not produce gas, it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure supplies for additional demand in its market area.  The Texas intrastate system has access to both onshore and offshore sources of supply, and is well positioned to interconnect with liquefied natural gas projects currently under development by others along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The Texas intrastate group also has access to markets within and outside of Texas through interconnections with numerous interstate natural gas pipelines.

Competition

 

The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment.  These operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for attachments to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  KMP believes the principal elements of competition in its various markets are transportation rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service.  From time to time, other pipeline projects are proposed that would compete with KMP’s pipelines, and some proposed pipelines may deliver natural gas to markets it serves from new supply sources closer to those markets.  KMP does not know whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on its operations or profitability.

 

Shippers on KMP’s natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils.  Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.

 

CO2—KMP

 

The CO2—KMP business segment consists of Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P. and its consolidated affiliates, collectively referred to in this report as KMCO2.  The CO2—KMP business segment produces, transports, and markets carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  KMCO2’s carbon dioxide pipelines and related assets allow it to market a complete package of carbon dioxide supply, transportation and technical expertise to its customers.  KMCO2 also holds ownership interests in several oil-producing fields and owns a crude oil pipeline, all located in the Permian Basin region of West Texas.

 

Oil and Gas Producing Activities

 

Oil Producing Interests

 

KMCO2 holds ownership interests in oil-producing fields located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, including: (i) an approximate 97% working interest in the SACROC unit; (ii) an approximate 50% working interest in the Yates unit; (iii) an approximate 21% net profits interest in the H.T. Boyd unit; (iv) an approximate 65% working interest in the Claytonville unit; (v) an approximate 99% working interest in the Katz Strawn unit; and (vi) lesser interests in the Sharon Ridge unit, the Reinecke unit and the MidCross unit.

 

The SACROC unit is one of the largest and oldest oil fields in the United States using carbon dioxide flooding technology.  The field is comprised of approximately 56,000 acres located in the Permian Basin in Scurry County, Texas.  KMCO2 has expanded the development of the carbon dioxide project initiated by the previous owners and increased production and ultimate oil recovery over the last several years.  In 2011, the average purchased carbon dioxide injection rate at SACROC was 154 million cubic feet per day.  The average oil production rate for 2011 was approximately 28,600 barrels of oil per day (23,800 net barrels to KMCO2 per day).

 

The Yates unit is also one of the largest oil fields ever discovered in the United States.  The field is comprised of approximately 26,000 acres located about 90 miles south of Midland, Texas.  KMCO2’s plan over the last several years has been to maintain overall production levels and increase ultimate recovery from Yates by combining horizontal drilling with carbon dioxide injection to ensure a relatively steady production profile over the next several years.  In 2011, the average purchased carbon dioxide injection rate at SACROC was 107 million cubic feet per day, and during 2011, the Yates unit produced approximately 21,700 barrels of oil per day (9,600 net barrels to KMCO2 per day).

 

KMCO2 also operates and owns an approximate 65% gross working interest in the Claytonville oil field unit and operates and owns an approximate 99% working interest in the Katz Strawn unit, both located in the Permian Basin area of West Texas.  The Claytonville unit is located nearly 30 miles east of the SACROC unit, in Fisher County, Texas.  The unit produced approximately 200 gross barrels of oil per day during 2011 (100 net barrels to KMCO2 per day).  During 2011, the Katz Strawn unit produced approximately 500 barrels of oil per day (400 net barrels to KMCO2 per day).  In 2011, the average purchased carbon dioxide injection rate at the Katz Strawn unit was 46 million cubic feet per day.

 

The following table sets forth productive wells, service wells and drilling wells in the oil and gas fields in which KMP owned interests as of December 31, 2011.

Gas and Gasoline Plant Interests

 

KMCO2 operates and owns an approximate 22% working interest plus an additional 28% net profits interest in the Snyder gasoline plant.  KMCO2 also operates and owns a 51% ownership interest in the Diamond M gas plant and a 100% ownership interest in the North Snyder plant, all of which are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas.  The Snyder gasoline plant processes natural gas produced from the SACROC unit and neighboring carbon dioxide projects, specifically the Sharon Ridge and Cogdell units, all of which are located in the Permian Basin area of West Texas.  The Diamond M and the North Snyder plants contract with the Snyder plant to process natural gas.  Production of natural gas liquids at the Snyder gasoline plant during 2011 averaged approximately 16,600 gross barrels per day (8,300 net barrels to KMCO2 per day excluding the value associated to KMCO2‘s 28% net profits interest).

Sales and Transportation Activities

 

Carbon Dioxide Reserves

 

KMCO2 owns approximately 45% of, and operates, the McElmo Dome unit in Colorado, which contains more than 6.6 trillion cubic feet of recoverable carbon dioxide.  It also owns approximately 87% of, and operates, the Doe Canyon Deep unit in Colorado, which contains more than 870 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide.  For both units combined, compression capacity exceeds 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of carbon dioxide and during 2011, the two units produced approximately 1.25 billion cubic feet per day of carbon dioxide.

 

KMCO2 also owns approximately 11% of the Bravo Dome unit in New Mexico.  The Bravo Dome unit contains more than 800 billion cubic feet of recoverable carbon dioxide and produced approximately 300 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day in 2011.

 

KMP’s principal market for carbon dioxide is for injection into mature oil fields in the Permian Basin, where industry demand is expected to remain strong for the next several years.

 

Carbon Dioxide Pipelines

 

As a result of KMP’s 50% ownership interest in Cortez Pipeline Company, it owns a 50% equity interest in and operates the approximate 500-mile Cortez pipeline.  The pipeline carries carbon dioxide from the McElmo Dome and Doe Canyon source fields near Cortez, Colorado to the Denver City, Texas hub.  The Cortez pipeline transports over 1.2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day.  The tariffs charged by the Cortez pipeline are not regulated, but are based on a consent decree.

 

KMCO2’s Central Basin pipeline consists of approximately 143 miles of mainline pipe and 177 miles of lateral supply lines located in the Permian Basin between Denver City, Texas and McCamey, Texas.  The pipeline has an ultimate throughput capacity of 700 million cubic feet per day.  At its origination point in Denver City, the Central Basin pipeline interconnects with all three major carbon dioxide supply pipelines from Colorado and New Mexico, namely the Cortez pipeline (operated by KMCO2) and the Bravo and Sheep Mountain pipelines (operated by Oxy Permian).  Central Basin’s mainline terminates near McCamey, where it interconnects with the Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline and the Pecos pipeline.  The tariffs charged by the Central Basin pipeline are not regulated.

 

KMCO2’s Centerline carbon dioxide pipeline consists of approximately 113 miles of pipe located in the Permian Basin between Denver City, Texas and Snyder, Texas.  The pipeline has a capacity of 300 million cubic feet per day.  The tariffs charged by the Centerline pipeline are not regulated.

 

KMCO2’s Eastern Shelf carbon dioxide pipeline, which consists of approximately 91 miles of pipe located in the Permian Basin, begins near Snyder, Texas and ends west of Knox City, Texas.  The pipeline has a current capacity of 70 million cubic feet per day, expandable to 200 million cubic feet per day in the future.  The Eastern Shelf Pipeline system is currently flowing 56 million cubic feet per day.  The tariffs charged on the Eastern Shelf pipeline are not regulated.

 

KMCO2 also owns a 13% undivided interest in the 218-mile, Bravo pipeline, which delivers carbon dioxide from the Bravo Dome source field in northeast New Mexico to the Denver City hub and has a capacity of more than 350 million cubic feet per day.  Tariffs on the Bravo pipeline are not regulated.  Occidental Petroleum (81%) and XTO Energy (6%) hold the remaining ownership interests in the Bravo pipeline.

 

In addition, KMCO2 owns approximately 98% of the Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline and approximately 69% of the Pecos pipeline.  The Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline extends 139 miles from McCamey, Texas, to the SACROC unit in the Permian Basin.  The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 270 million cubic feet per day and makes deliveries to the SACROC, Sharon Ridge, Cogdell and Reinecke units.  The Pecos pipeline is a 25-mile pipeline that runs from McCamey to Iraan, Texas.  It has a capacity of approximately 120 million cubic feet per day and makes deliveries to the Yates unit.  The tariffs charged on the Canyon Reef Carriers and Pecos pipelines are not regulated.

 

The principal market for transportation on KMP’s carbon dioxide pipelines is to customers, including itself, using carbon dioxide for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the Permian Basin, where industry demand is expected to remain strong for the next several years.

Crude Oil Pipeline

 

KMCO2’s owns the Kinder Morgan Wink Pipeline, a 450-mile Texas intrastate crude oil pipeline system consisting of three mainline sections, two gathering systems and numerous truck delivery stations.  The pipeline allows KMCO2 to better manage crude oil deliveries from its oil field interests in West Texas. KMCO2 has entered into a long-term throughput agreement with Western Refining Company, L.P. to transport crude oil into Western’s 120,000 barrel per day refinery located in El Paso, Texas.  The throughput agreement expires in 2034.  The 20-inch diameter pipeline segment that runs from Wink to El Paso, Texas has a total capacity of 130,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it transported approximately 112,000 barrels of oil per day in 2011.  The Kinder Morgan Wink Pipeline is regulated by both the FERC and the Texas Railroad Commission.

 

Competition

 

KMP’s primary competitors for the sale of carbon dioxide include suppliers that have an ownership interest in McElmo Dome, Bravo Dome and Sheep Mountain carbon dioxide reserves, and Petro-Source Carbon Company, which gathers waste carbon dioxide from natural gas production in the Val Verde Basin of West Texas.  KMP’s ownership interests in the Central Basin, Cortez and Bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other carbon dioxide pipelines.  KMP also competes with other interest owners in the McElmo Dome unit and the Bravo Dome unit for transportation of carbon dioxide to the Denver City, Texas market area.

 

Terminals—KMP

 

The Terminals—KMP business segment includes the operations of KMP’s petroleum, chemical and other liquids terminal facilities (other than those included in the Products Pipelines—KMP business segment) and all of its coal, petroleum coke, fertilizer, steel, ores and other dry-bulk material services facilities, including all transload, engineering, conveying and other in-plant services.  Combined, the segment is composed of approximately 115 owned or operated liquids and bulk terminal facilities and approximately 35 rail transloading and materials handling facilities.  The terminals are located throughout the United States and in portions of Canada. KMP believes the location of its facilities and its ability to provide flexibility to customers helps keep customers at KMP terminals and provides it opportunities for expansion.  KMP often classifies its terminal operations based on their handling of either liquids or bulk material products.

 

Liquids Terminals

 

KMP’s liquids terminals operations primarily store refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, ethanol, industrial chemicals and vegetable oil products in aboveground storage tanks and transfer products to and from pipelines, vessels, tank trucks, tank barges, and tank railcars.  Combined, KMP’s approximately 25 liquids terminals facilities possess liquids storage capacity of approximately 60.2 million barrels, and in 2011, these terminals handled approximately 616 million barrels of liquids products, including petroleum products, ethanol and chemicals.

 

Bulk Terminals

 

KMP’s bulk terminal operations primarily involve dry-bulk material handling services. KMP also provides conveyor manufacturing and installation, engineering and design services, and in-plant services covering material handling, conveying, maintenance and repair, truck-railcar-marine transloading, railcar switching and miscellaneous marine services.  KMP owns or operates approximately 90 dry-bulk terminals in the United States and Canada, and combined, its dry-bulk and material transloading facilities (described below) handled approximately 100.6 million tons of coal, petroleum coke, fertilizers, steel, ores and other dry-bulk materials in 2011.

 

Materials Services (rail transloading)

 

KMP’s materials services operations include rail or truck transloading shipments from one medium of transportation to another conducted at approximately 35 owned and non-owned facilities.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, Kansas City Southern and A&W railroads provide rail service for these terminal facilities.  Approximately 50% of the products handled are liquids, including an entire spectrum of liquid chemicals, and the rest are dry-bulk products.  Many of the facilities are equipped for bi-modal operation (rail-to-truck, and truck-to-rail) or connect via pipeline to storage facilities.  Several facilities provide railcar storage services.  KMP also designs and builds transloading facilities, performs inventory management services, and provides value-added services such as blending, heating and sparging.

Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











 

Competition

 

KMP is one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the United States, based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity.  KMP’s liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals, and terminals owned by oil, chemical and pipeline companies.  KMP’s bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services.  In some locations, KMP’s competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.  KMP’s rail transloading (material services) operations compete with a variety of single- or multi-site transload, warehouse and terminal operators across the United States.  KMP’s ethanol rail transload operations compete with a variety of ethanol handling terminal sites across the United States, many offering waterborne service, truck loading, and unit train capability serviced by Class 1 rail carriers.

 

Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP

 

The Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP business segment includes the Trans Mountain pipeline system, KMP’s ownership of a one-third interest in the Express pipeline system, and the 25-mile Jet Fuel pipeline system.  The weighted average remaining life of the shipping contracts on these pipeline systems was approximately two years as of December 31, 2011.

 

Trans Mountain Pipeline System

 

The Trans Mountain pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of British Columbia.  Trans Mountain’s pipeline is 715 miles in length. KMP also owns a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of Washington.  The capacity of the line at Edmonton ranges from 300,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude percentage), to 400,000 barrels per day with no heavy crude.  Trans Mountain is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from Alberta to the west coast.  KMP believes these facilities provide it the opportunity to consider capacity expansions to the west coast, either in stages or as one project, as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.

 

In 2011, Trans Mountain delivered an average of 274,000 barrels per day.  The crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system originates in Alberta and British Columbia.  The refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to Kamloops, British Columbia and Vancouver originates from oil refineries located in Edmonton.  Petroleum products delivered through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in British Columbia, Washington State and elsewhere offshore.

 

Trans Mountain also operates a 5.3 mile spur line from its Sumas Pump Station to the U.S. – Canada international border where it connects with KMP’s approximate 63-mile, 16-inch to 20-inch diameter Puget Sound pipeline system.  The Puget Sound pipeline system in the state of Washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 135,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents approximately 25% of throughput, and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern Washington State.  The volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of Washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of Canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in Alaska and other offshore sources.

 

In January 2012, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2012.  Trans Mountain anticipates National Energy Board approval in the second quarter of 2012.

 

Express and Jet Fuel Pipeline Systems

 

KMP owns a one-third ownership interest in the Express pipeline system, and a subordinated debenture issued by Express US Holdings LP, the partnership that maintains ownership of the U.S. portion of the Express pipeline system.  KMP operates the Express pipeline system and accounts for its one-third investment under the equity method of accounting.  The Express pipeline system is a batch-mode, common-carrier, crude oil pipeline system comprised of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline, collectively referred to in this report as the Express pipeline system.  The approximate 1,700-mile integrated oil transportation pipeline connects Canadian and United States producers to refineries located in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.

 

The Express Pipeline is a 780-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that begins at the crude oil pipeline terminal at Hardisty, Alberta and terminates at the Casper, Wyoming facilities of the Platte Pipeline.  The Express Pipeline has a design capacity of 280,000 barrels per day.  Receipts at Hardisty averaged 175,000 barrels per day in 2011.

Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











 

The Platte Pipeline is a 926-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that runs from the crude oil pipeline terminal at Casper, Wyoming to refineries and interconnecting pipelines in the Wood River, Illinois area.  The Platte Pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 150,000 barrels per day downstream of Casper, Wyoming and approximately 140,000 barrels per day downstream of Guernsey, Wyoming.  Platte deliveries averaged 148,000 barrels per day in 2011.

 

KMP also owns and operates the approximate 25-mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the Vancouver International Airport, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the Jet Fuel pipeline system.  In addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the Westridge Marine terminal, located in Port Metro Vancouver, the Jet Fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the Vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15,000 barrels.

 

Competition.

 

Trans Mountain and the Express pipeline system are each one of several pipeline alternatives for western Canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production, and each competes against other pipeline providers.

 

NGPL PipeCo LLC

 

We own a 20% interest in NGPL PipeCo LLC and account for our interest as an equity method investment.  We continue to operate NGPL PipeCo LLC’s assets pursuant to an operations and reimbursement agreement effective through February 15, 2023.  NGPL PipeCo LLC owns a major interstate gas pipeline and storage system consisting primarily of two major interconnected natural gas transmission pipelines terminating in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. NGPL’s Amarillo Line originates in the West Texas and New Mexico producing areas and is comprised of approximately 4,400 miles of mainline and various small-diameter pipelines. Its other major pipeline, the Gulf Coast Line, originates in the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana and consists of approximately 4,100 miles of mainline and various small-diameter pipelines.  These two main pipelines are connected at points in Texas and Oklahoma by NGPL’s approximately 800-mile Amarillo/Gulf Coast pipeline.

 

NGPL is one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage operators with approximately 600 billion cubic feet of total natural gas storage capacity, approximately 278 billion cubic feet of working gas capacity and over 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of peak deliverability from its storage facilities, which are located in major supply areas and near the markets it serves.  NGPL owns and operates 13 underground storage reservoirs in eight field locations in four states.  These storage assets complement its pipeline facilities and allow it to optimize pipeline deliveries and meet peak delivery requirements in its principal markets.

 

Competition

 

NGPL competes with other transporters of natural gas in virtually all of the markets it serves including the Chicago area, which is the northern terminus of NGPL’s two major pipeline segments and its largest market.  These competitors include both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines that source gas from multiple supply basins in the U.S. and Canada, and serve multiple markets.  From time to time, other pipelines are proposed which would compete with NGPL. We cannot predict whether or when any such pipeline might be built, or its impact on NGPL’s operations or profitability.

 

Major Customers

 

Our total operating revenues are derived from a wide customer base. For each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues.  KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of Texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the CO2—KMP business segment also sells natural gas.  Combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP and CO2—KMP business segments in 2011, 2010 and 2009 accounted for 40.4%, 44.1% and 43.7%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.  To the extent possible, KMP attempts to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales.  We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulation

 

Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations

 

Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.

 

On October 24, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The Energy Policy Act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.  Certain rates on KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the Pacific pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

 

Petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.

 

Common Carrier Pipeline Rate Regulation – Canadian Operations

 

The Canadian portion of KMP’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of Canada’s National Energy Board, referred to in this report as the NEB.  The National Energy Board Act gives the NEB power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service.

 

Trans Mountain Pipeline.  KMP’s subsidiary, Trans Mountain Pipeline, L.P., previously had a one-year toll settlement with shippers that expired on December 31, 2011.  In January 2012, Trans Mountain Pipeline completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement for KMP’s Trans Mountain Pipeline to be effective for 2012.  Trans Mountain anticipates approval from the NEB in the second quarter of 2012.  The toll charged for the portion of Trans Mountain’s pipeline system located in the United States falls under the jurisdiction of the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”

 

Express Pipeline.  The Canadian segment of the Express Pipeline is regulated by the NEB as a Group 2 pipeline, which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only.  Express committed contract rates are subject to a 2% inflation adjustment April 1 of each year.  The U.S. segment of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline are regulated by the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”  Additionally, movements on the Platte Pipeline within the state of Wyoming are regulated by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that operate in the state of Wyoming.  The Wyoming Public Service Commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the FERC and the NEB.

 

Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation

 

Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition, so long as

 







  



28







  








Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  There are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay, and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable.

 

The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Beginning in the mid-1980’s, through the mid-1990’s, the FERC initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace. Among the most important of these changes were:

 





  


▪


Order No. 436 (1985) which required open-access, nondiscriminatory transportation of natural gas;




 





  


▪


Order No. 497 (1988) which set forth new standards and guidelines imposing certain constraints on the interaction between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates and imposing certain disclosure requirements regarding that interaction; and




 





  


▪


Order No. 636 (1992) which required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open-access transportation under blanket certificates to “unbundle” or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies.  Natural gas pipelines must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for the natural gas commodity, transportation and storage).




 

The FERC also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities.  In light of the changing structure of the energy industry, these standards of conduct govern employee relationships—using a functional approach—to ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Pursuant to the FERC’s standards of conduct, a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee non-public information about the transmission system or a transmission customer.  Additionally, no-conduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing non-public information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit.

 

The FERC standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues, including (i) the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees; (ii) the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees; (iii) the definition of transmission function information; (iv) independent functioning; (v) transparency; and (vi) the interaction of FERC standards with the North American Energy Standards Board business practice standards.  Rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.

 

In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.

 

California Public Utilities Commission Rate Regulation

 

The intrastate common carrier operations of KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, referred to in this report as the CPUC, under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by KMP with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the Pacific operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to KMP’s FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates.  Certain of the Pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been, and continue to be, subject to complaints with the CPUC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Texas Railroad Commission Rate Regulation

 

The intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the Texas Railroad Commission.  The Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.

 

Safety Regulation

 

Our interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, referred to in this report as the U.S. DOT, and our intrastate pipelines and other operations are subject to comparable state regulations with respect to their design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management.  Comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct pipeline operations.  In addition, our truck and terminal loading facilities are subject to U.S. DOT regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicles and railcars.

 

On September 15, 2010, the secretary of the U.S. DOT sent to the U.S. Congress proposed legislation to provide stronger oversight of the nation’s pipelines and to increase the penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules.  The proposed legislation entitled “Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010,” would, among other things, increase the maximum fine for the most serious violations from $1 million to $2.5 million, provide additional resources for the enforcement program, require a review of whether safety requirements for “high consequence areas” should be applied instead to entire pipelines, eliminate exemptions and ensure standards are in place for bio-fuel and carbon dioxide pipelines.

 

The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 provides guidelines in the areas of testing, education, training and communication.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as “high consequence areas.”  Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal magnetic flux or ultrasonic testing, or direct assessment of the piping.  In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained.  A similar integrity management rule exists for refined petroleum products pipelines.

 

We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and other comparable federal and state statutes that address employee health and safety.  In general, we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards; however, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be accurately estimated at this time.

 

State and Local Regulation

 

Our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.

 

Environmental Matters

 

Our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the United States and Canada.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.

 

Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be

 







  



30







  








Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 

In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed.  We have accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referred to in this report as the U.S. EPA, or similar state or Canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties.  The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.

 

We believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  We have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of $79.7 million as of December 31, 2011.  Our reserve estimates range in value from approximately $79.7 million to approximately $134.7 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability.  For additional information related to environmental matters, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

 

Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste

 

We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state and Canadian statutes.  From time to time, the U.S. EPA and state and Canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.

 

Superfund

 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the U.S. EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance.  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.

 

Clean Air Act

 

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and Canadian statutes and regulations.  We believe that the operations of our pipelines, storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes.  The U.S. EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.  These regulations contain lengthy, complex provisions that may result in the imposition over the next several years of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our pipelines, treating and processing facilities, storage facilities, terminals and wells.  Depending on the nature of those requirements and any additional requirements that may be imposed by state and local regulatory authorities, we may be required to incur capital and operating expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals and addressing other air emission-related issues.  At this time, we are unable to fully estimate the effect on earnings or operations or the amount and timing of such required capital

 







  



31







  








Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











expenditures; however, we do not believe that we will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements.

 

Clean Water Act

 

Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or Canadian authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state and Canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release.

 

Climate Change

 

Studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.  It is not possible at this time to predict what action, if any, the U.S. Congress may take in regard to greenhouse gas legislation.

 

As discussed above under “—Clean Air Act,” the U.S. EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.  These regulations include the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, fractionated natural gas liquids, and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide, like KMP’s McElmo Dome carbon dioxide field, even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere.

 

Because KMP’s operations, including the compressor stations and gas processing plants in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities and require us to install new emission controls on the facilities, acquire allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  KMP is not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, they could be significant.  While KMP may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its natural gas pipelines, such recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond its control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  To the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions.  However, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon.  Thus, we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or U.S. EPA regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the CO2—KMP business segment.  However, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although the magnitude and direction of these impacts cannot now be predicted, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Department of Homeland Security

 

In Section 550 of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, the U.S. Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical

 







  



32







  








Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties. (continued)



Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











facilities.  Pursuant to its congressional mandate, on April 9, 2007, the DHS promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.

 

Other

 

Employees

 

We employed 8,120 full-time people at December 31, 2011, including employees of our indirect subsidiary KMGP Services Company, Inc., who are dedicated to the operations of KMP, and employees of Kinder Morgan Canada Inc.  Approximately 833 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2016.  We, KMGP Services Company, Inc., and Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. each consider relations with our employees to be good.  For more information on our related party transactions, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

 

KMGP Services Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., provides employees and Kinder Morgan Services LLC, a subsidiary of KMR, provides centralized payroll and employee benefits services to KMR, KMP and KMP’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries (collectively, “the Group”).  Employees of KMGP Services Company, Inc. are assigned to work for one or more members of the Group.  The direct costs of compensation, benefits expenses, employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated and charged by Kinder Morgan Services LLC to the appropriate members of the Group, and the members of the Group reimburse their allocated shares of these direct costs.  No profit or margin is charged by Kinder Morgan Services LLC to the members of the Group.  Our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services, and the related administrative costs are allocated to members of the Group in accordance with existing expense allocation procedures.  The effect of these arrangements is that each member of the Group bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees, as the case may be, while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs.  Pursuant to its limited partnership agreement, KMP provides reimbursement for its share of these administrative costs and such reimbursements are accounted for as described above.  KMP reimburses KMR with respect to the costs incurred or allocated to KMR in accordance with KMP’s limited partnership agreement, the Delegation of Control Agreement among Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., KMR, KMP and others, and KMR’s limited liability company agreement.

 

Our named executive officers and other employees that provide management or services to us and the Group are employed by us.  Additionally, other of our employees assist KMP in the operation of its Natural Gas Pipeline assets.  These employees’ expenses are allocated without a profit component between us and the appropriate members of the Group.

 

Properties

 

We believe that we have generally satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses, subject to liens for current taxes, liens incident to minor encumbrances, and easements and restrictions, which do not materially detract from the value of such property, the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses.  Our terminals, storage facilities, treating and processing plants, regulator and compressor stations, oil and gas wells, offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us.  In some cases, the real property we lease is on federal, state, provincial or local government land.

 

We generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed.  Instead, we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time.  Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of such property.  In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants.  In some cases, not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the right-of-way grants, but in substantially all such cases, signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained.  Permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, water courses, county roads, municipal streets and state highways, and in some instances, such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor, or, the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense.  Permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under

Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











 

lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election.  Some such permits require annual or other periodic payments.  In a few minor cases, property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

 

You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document.  Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

 

Risks Related to the Completion of the Merger

 

On October 16, 2011, we and El Paso Corporation (EP) announced a definitive agreement whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of EP.  The merger has been approved by each company’s board of directors.  We have firm commitments for the full amount of cash required for the merger from a syndicate of banks.  Prior to closing, the merger will require approval of both our and EP’s shareholders.  The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals.  See Items 1 and 2 “Business and Properties—Pending Acquisition of El Paso Corporation.”

 

We and EP may be unable to obtain the regulatory clearances and approvals required to complete the merger or, in order to do so, we and EP may be required to comply with material restrictions or satisfy material conditions.

 

The merger is subject to regulatory review by governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.  The closing of the merger is also subject to the condition that there be no law, injunction, judgment or ruling by a governmental authority in effect seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.  We can provide no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained.  Further, we have agreed to avoid or eliminate any impediment to the merger that may be asserted by governmental entities under the antitrust laws, including by divesting assets, terminating relationships or committing to limit our future freedom of action.  There can be no assurance as to the cost, scope or impact of the actions that may be required to obtain antitrust approval.  If we must take such actions, it could be detrimental to us or to the combined company after the effective time of the merger.  Furthermore, these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the consummation of the merger.  Additionally, even if the parties receive early termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act or the waiting period thereunder expires, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws to prevent or rescind the merger, require the divestiture of assets or seek other remedies.  Additionally, the FERC, state attorneys general or foreign governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest at any time, including after completion of the merger.  In addition, in some circumstances, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger, before or after it is completed.  We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.

 

If our financing for the merger becomes unavailable, the merger may not be completed and we may be in breach of the merger agreement.

 

We intend to finance the cash required in connection with the merger, including for expenses incurred in connection with the transactions, with debt financing.  On February 10, 2012, we entered into an amendment to our existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility to, among other things, permit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and a new credit agreement to provide a $6.8 billion senior secured 364-day bridge term loan facility, a $5.0 billion senior secured three-year term loan facility and joinder agreement to provide an additional $750 million in commitments under our existing revolving credit facility, all effective upon completion of the merger.  The obligation of the lenders to provide the debt financing is subject to various conditions, including the repayment of all amounts outstanding under and termination of EP’s existing credit facility, and other customary closing conditions.  In the event any of the closing conditions is not satisfied or waived, or to the extent one or more of the lenders is unwilling to, or unable to, fund its commitments under the debt financing, we may be required to seek alternative financing or fund the cash required in connection with the merger ourselves.  Due to the fact that there is no funding condition in the merger agreement, if we are unable to obtain funding from our financing sources for the cash required in connection with the transactions, we could be in breach of the merger agreement assuming all other conditions to closing are satisfied and may be liable to EP for damages.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K














We and EP may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the merger.


 

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on EP employees and our employees may have an adverse effect on EP and us and consequently the combined company.  This uncertainty may impair the respective company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the merger is completed.  Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with the combined company.  In addition, we may have to provide additional compensation to retain employees.  If employees of EP or our employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced.

 

We will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the merger.

 

We expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies.  These fees and costs will be substantial.  Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs.  Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and EP’s businesses.  There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time.  Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.

 

Failure to successfully combine our and EP’s businesses in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company, and, consequently, the value of our common stock and/or warrants that EP stockholders receive as part of the merger consideration.

 

The success of the proposed merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our and EP’s businesses.  To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined.  If the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully or at all.  In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions.  These integration difficulties could result in declines in the market value of our common stock and, consequently, result in declines in the market value of the common stock and warrants that EP stockholders receive as part of the merger consideration and continue to hold following consummation of the proposed transactions.

 

Failure to complete the merger, or significant delays in completing the merger, could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results.

 

Completion of the merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transaction by the stockholders of EP or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied.  If the merger is not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the merger, it could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results, and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:









  


▪


having to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger;




 





  


▪


the parties may be liable for damages to one another under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement;




 





  


▪


negative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of our common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and




 





  


▪


the attention of our management will have been diverted to the merger rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.

Purported stockholder class action complaints have been filed against EP, us, the members of EP’s board of directors, EP’s and our merger subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs, challenging the transactions, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the proposed transactions and result in substantial costs.

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, purported stockholders of EP have filed numerous purported stockholder class action lawsuits in the District Court of Harris County, Texas and in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  Those lawsuits name as defendants EP, Kinder Morgan, the members of the board of directors of EP, and, in certain cases, the affiliates of EP and us and Goldman, Sachs & Co.  Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the proposed transactions.  If a final settlement is not reached, or if a dismissal is not obtained, these lawsuits could prevent and/or delay completion of the transactions and result in substantial costs to EP and us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors.  Additional lawsuits may be filed against EP and us, our respective affiliates and EP’s directors related to the proposed transactions.  The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

 

We may not be able to sell EP’s exploration and production assets in a timely manner, on satisfactory terms and conditions, at a satisfactory price, or at all.

 

We expect to sell EP’s exploration and production assets around the same time as the consummation of the transactions in order to help reduce the level of indebtedness incurred to finance the transactions.  The sale of EP’s exploration and production assets is dependent upon a number of factors, including the availability of potential purchasers, reaching agreement with respect to the purchase price of such assets and negotiating definitive documentation upon satisfactory terms and conditions.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell EP’s exploration and production assets in a timely manner or at all.  In the event we are unable to sell EP’s exploration and production assets as expected, the combined company will have an increased amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our profitability.

 


Due to a disagreement between EP and one of its joint venture partners, our and EP’s ability to obtain the consents of the independent auditors of the joint venture and of EP to include or incorporate by reference their respective audit reports in our and EP’s filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act may be severely limited.  As a result, our and/or EP’s ability to access capital markets through registered offerings and make certain filings required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act may be limited, potentially significantly.

 

EP and another party are partners in a pipeline joint venture (referred to as the “Joint Venture”) in which the other party is currently acting as the operator (referred to as the “JV Operator”).  In connection with a planned amendment to our Registration Statement on Form S-4, the JV Operator previously refused to provide a management representation letter to the independent auditor of the Joint Venture.  The JV Operator has also indicated that it will continue to refuse to provide such management representation letters to auditors for both us and EP except in connection with EP’s annual and quarterly filings under the Exchange Act.  As a result, from time to time, we and EP may be unable to include or incorporate by reference in our and EP’s respective filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the audited financial statements of the Joint Venture.  Furthermore, we and EP may be unable to obtain the consent of the independent auditor of EP (which relies on the audit report of the independent auditor of the Joint Venture in its audit report on the audited financial statements of EP) to include or incorporate by reference its audit reports.

 

The inability to obtain a management representation letter from the JV Operator except in connection with the filing of EP’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and therefore, the inability to obtain the consent of the independent auditors of the Joint Venture and of EP to include or incorporate by reference their respective audit reports, may limit our ability to timely make necessary post-effective amendments to our Registration Statement on Form S-4 and our ability and/or the ability of EP (and our respective affiliates) to access capital.  Notwithstanding the fact the JV Operator has indicated that it will provide a management representation letter to the independent auditor of the Joint Venture in connection with the filing of EP’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, there can be no assurance that the JV Operator will, in fact, do so.  Failure of the JV Operator to provide a management representation letter in connection with the filing of EP’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q could inhibit or prevent us and/or EP from accessing the capital markets and/or making filings required under the Securities Act and Exchange Act and could have an adverse impact on our and/or EP’s business and operations, which could be material depending on then-existing circumstances.

Risks Relating to Our Business

 

We are dependent on cash distributions received from KMP.

 

Approximately 98% and 97% of the distributions we received from our subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively were attributable to KMP.  A decline in KMP’s revenues or increases in its general and administrative expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, expenditures for taxes, working capital requirements or other cash needs will limit the amount of cash KMP can distribute to us, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which could be material.

 

New regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes in regulations, by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our income and operations.

 

Our pipelines and storage facilities are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state and local regulatory authorities, such as the FERC, the CPUC and the NEB.  Regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability.  Regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as (i) rates (which include reservation, commodity, surcharges, fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for), operating terms and conditions of service; (ii) the types of services we may offer to our customers; (iii) the contracts for service entered into with our customers; (iv) the certification and construction of new facilities; (v) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (vi) the acquisition of other businesses; (vii) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (viii) reporting and information posting requirements; (ix) the maintenance of accounts and records; and (x) relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses.

 

Should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders of such regulatory authorities, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.  Furthermore, new laws or regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources.  For example, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 required the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” New laws or regulations, or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations, including unexpected policy changes, applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For more information, see Items 1 and 2 “Business and Properties—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Regulation.”

 

The FERC may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us.  In addition, the FERC or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines, and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us.

 

The profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers.  To the extent that such costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the FERC to recover in our rates, or to the extent that there is a lag before the pipeline can file and obtain rate increases, such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results.

 

Our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint.  Regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge, and have challenged, the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations.  Some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the FERC and the CPUC that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates on KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipeline system.  Further, the FERC has initiated investigations to determine whether some interstate natural gas pipelines have over-collected on rates charged to shippers.  We may face challenges, similar to those described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, to the rates we charge on KMP’s and NGPL pipelines.  Any successful challenge could materially adversely affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











Energy commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

 

There are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to natural gas transmission and storage activities and refined petroleum products and carbon dioxide transportation activities—such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems—that could result in substantial financial losses.  In addition, these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life, significant damage to property and natural resources, environmental pollution and impairment of operations, any of which also could result in substantial financial losses.  For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater.  Incidents that cause an interruption of service, such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure, may negatively impact our revenues and earnings while the affected asset is temporarily out of service.  In addition, if losses in excess of our insurance coverage were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines will require us to spend additional money to comply with these requirements.

 

Through our regulated pipeline subsidiaries, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity.  There are, for example, federal guidelines for the U.S. DOT and pipeline companies in the areas of testing, education, training and communication.  The U.S. DOT issued final rules (effective February 2004 with respect to natural gas pipelines) requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rules refer to as “High Consequence Areas.”  The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict.  The majority of the costs to comply with the rules are associated with pipeline integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary.  Changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in High Consequence Areas can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs.  We plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the U.S. DOT rules.  The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.

 

Further, additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

 

We may face competition from competing pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems.

 

Any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil, petroleum products or natural gas into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors.  To the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists, our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired.  We also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems.  Several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us.

 

Cost overruns and delays on our expansion and new build projects could adversely affect our business.

 

KMP recently completed several major expansion and new build projects, including the joint venture projects Rockies Express Pipeline, Midcontinent Express Pipeline and Fayetteville Express Pipeline.  KMP also is conducting and conducts from time to time alone or with others what are referred to as “open seasons” to evaluate the potential customer interest for new construction projects.  A variety of factors outside of its control, such as weather, natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way or other regulatory approvals, as well as performance by third-party contractors, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs or delays in construction.  Significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)

We must either obtain the right from landowners or exercise the power of eminent domain in order to use most of the land on which our pipelines are constructed, and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use.

 

We obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land for a period of time.  If we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines, our business could be affected negatively.  In addition, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners, primarily through rental increases and renewals of expired agreements.

 

Whether KMP has the power of eminent domain for its pipelines, other than interstate natural gas pipelines, varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids, natural gas or carbon dioxide—and the laws of the particular state.  KMP’s interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority.  In either case, KMP must compensate landowners for the use of their property and, in eminent domain actions, such compensation may be determined by a court.  KMP’s inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect its business if it were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which its pipelines are located. 

 

KMP’s acquisition strategy and expansion programs require access to new capital.  Tightened capital markets or more expensive capital would impair our ability to grow.

 

Consistent with the terms of KMP’s partnership agreement, it has distributed most of the cash generated by its operations.  As a result, KMP has relied on external financing sources, including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities, to fund its acquisition and growth capital expenditures.  However, to the extent KMP is unable to continue to finance growth externally, KMP’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow.  KMP may need new capital to finance these activities.  Limitations on KMP’s access to capital will impair its ability to execute this strategy.

 

KMP’s growth strategy may cause difficulties integrating and constructing new operations, and it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from any future acquisitions.

 

Part of KMP’s business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses, expanding existing assets and constructing new facilities.  If KMP does not successfully integrate acquisitions, expansions or newly constructed facilities, it may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings.  The integration of companies that have previously operated separately involves a number of risks, including (i) demands on management related to the increase in its size after an acquisition, expansion or completed construction project; (ii) the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations; (iii) difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting, estimating, reporting and other systems; (iv) difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees; and (v) potential adverse effects on operating results.

 

KMP may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately.  Successful integration of each acquisition, expansion or construction project will depend upon its ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs.  Because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations, KMP may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other size-related benefits that it hoped to achieve after these acquisitions, which would harm its financial condition and results of operations.

 

Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities.

 

Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations, and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Clean Water Act or analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.  Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs and/or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K













Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil, criminal and administrative fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could influence our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damage, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under the Federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal, state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.

 

We own and/or operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities.  While we have utilized operating, handling, and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time, hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned, operated or used by us or our predecessors, or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal.  In addition, many of these properties have been owned and/or operated by third parties whose management, handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control.  These properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the United States such as CERCLA, which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.  Under the regulatory schemes of the various Canadian provinces, such as British Columbia's Environmental Management Act, Canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned, operated or used by us or our predecessors.  Under such laws and implementing regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators.  Imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position.

 

In addition, our oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control.  These laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation.  Specifically, these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling, restrictions on drilling activities in restricted areas, emissions into the environment, water discharges, transportation of hazardous materials, and storage and disposition of wastes.  In addition, legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities.

 

Further, we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.  For more information, see Items 1 and 2 “Business and Properties—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters.”

 

Climate change regulation at the federal, state, provincial or regional levels could result in increased operating and capital costs for us.

 

Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.  The U.S. EPA began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions of certain stationary sources on January 2, 2011, and issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, fractionated natural gas liquids, and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide, like KMP’s McElmo Dome carbon dioxide field, even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere.

 

Because our operations, including our compressor stations and natural gas processing plants in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP segment, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and require us to install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, they could be significant.  Recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  For more information about

climate change regulation, see Items 1 and 2 “Business and Properties—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters—Climate Change.”

 

Increased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact KMP’s revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on KMP’s or its  joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines.

 

The natural gas industry is increasingly relying on natural gas supplies from unconventional sources, such as shale, tight sands and coal bed methane.  Natural gas extracted from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water, sand, and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells.  Recently, there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators, which could reduce their production of natural gas and, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on KMP’s or KMP’s joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines, several of which gather gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent.

 

Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.

 

As of December 31, 2011, we had $16.1 billion of consolidated debt (including KMP but excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements).  This level of debt could have important consequences, such as (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes; (ii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iii) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (iv) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.

 

Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  If our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness, or any future indebtedness that we incur, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital.  We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.  For more information about our debt, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

 

Our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates. 

 

As of December 31, 2011, approximately $7.2 billion (45%) of our total $16.1 billion consolidated debt (including KMP but excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements) was subject to variable interest rates, either as short-term or long-term debt of variable rate debt obligations or as long-term fixed-rate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps.  Should interest rates increase, the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings could be adversely affected.  For more information about our interest rate risk, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.”

 

We do not have an investment grade credit rating, which may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs.

 

Since the Going Private Transaction, KMI’s credit ratings have been below investment grade.  As a result, we have not had access to the commercial paper market and have utilized KMI’s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility for our short-term borrowing needs.  Non-investment grade credit ratings limit our access to the debt markets and increase our cost of capital.  The instruments governing any future debt may contain more restrictive covenants than if we had investment grade credit ratings.  Our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted by these covenants.  A downgrade in one or more of KMP’s credit ratings to non-investment grade would similarly affect KMP.

 




  



42







  






Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











Our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs.

 

The instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us.  The agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on (i) incurring additional debt; (ii) entering into mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (iii) granting liens; and (iv) entering into sale-leaseback transactions.  The instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions.  Our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted.

 

There is the potential for a change of control of the general partner of KMP if we default on debt.

 

We own all of the common equity of Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., the general partner of KMP.  If we default on debt, then the lenders under such debt, in exercising their rights as lenders, could acquire control of Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc. or otherwise influence Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc. through their control of us.  A change of control of Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc. could materially adversely affect the distributions we receive from KMP, which could have a material adverse impact on us or our cash available for dividends to our stockholders.

 

Current or future distressed financial conditions of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide. 

 

Some of our customers are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness.  We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows.  Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities.  In addition, such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 

Terrorist attacks, or the threat of them, may adversely affect our business.

 

The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations.  These potential targets might include our pipeline systems or storage facilities.  Our operations could become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that would require increased security measures.  There is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future.  These developments may subject our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

Future business development of our pipelines is dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities transported by our pipelines.

 

Our pipelines depend on production of natural gas, oil and other products in the areas served by our pipelines.  Without reserve additions, production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise.  Producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs, especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies, such as in the Alberta oil sands.  Producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves, and our gas plants and pipelines may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput.  Commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at a level that encourages producers to explore for and develop additional reserves, produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire.

 

Changes in the business environment, such as a decline in crude oil or natural gas prices, an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices, supply disruptions, or higher development costs, could result in a slowing of supply from oil and natural gas producing areas.  In addition, with respect to the CO2—KMP business segment, changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil and natural gas.  Each of these factors impact our customers shipping through our pipelines, which in turn could impact the prospects of new transportation contracts or renewals of existing contracts.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











Throughput on KMP’s crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products pipelines also may decline as a result of changes in business conditions.  Over the long term, business will depend, in part, on the level of demand for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products in the geographic areas in which deliveries are made by pipelines and the ability and willingness of shippers having access or rights to utilize the pipelines to supply such demand.

 

The implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas, crude oil and refined petroleum products, increase our costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  We cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, all of which could reduce the demand for natural gas, crude oil and refined petroleum products.

 

The future success of KMP’s oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon its ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.

 

The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted.  Without successful development activities, the reserves and revenues of the oil and gas producing assets within the CO2—KMP business segment will decline.  KMP may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future.  Additionally, if KMP does not realize production volumes greater than, or equal to, its hedged volumes, it may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions.

 

KMP’s development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment.

 

The business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome.  Acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that, while they may be reasonable, are by their nature speculative.  It is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well.  Furthermore, the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment.  A variety of geological, operational and market-related factors, including, but not limited to, unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, equipment failures or accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pollution and other environmental risks, shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment, loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions, may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable.  A productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered, which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or gas from the well.  In addition, production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances.

 

The volatility of natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on KMP’s business.

 

The revenues, profitability and future growth of the CO2—KMP business segment and the carrying value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas properties depend to a large degree on prevailing oil and gas prices.  For 2012, KMP estimates that every $1 change in the average West Texas Intermediate crude oil price per barrel would impact the CO2—KMP segment’s cash flows by approximately $5.8 million.  Prices for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond KMP’s control.  These factors include, among other things (i) weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the United States; (ii) the condition of the United States economy; (iii) the activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; (iv) governmental regulation; (v) political stability in the Middle East and elsewhere; (vi) the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; (vii) the price of foreign imports; and (viii) the availability of alternative fuel sources.

 

A sharp decline in the price of oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas would result in a commensurate reduction in KMP’s revenues, income and cash flows from the production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of KMP’s proved reserves.  In the event prices fall substantially, KMP may not be able to realize a profit from its production and would operate at a loss.  In recent decades, there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts.  Such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of, and reduced demand for, crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis.  These periods have been followed by periods of short supply of, and increased demand for, crude oil and natural gas.  The excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand.  These fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process.  For more information

Our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income.

 

We engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas.  These hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than expected, when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations, or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received.  In addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas.

 

The accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex, and even when we engage in hedging transactions (for example, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates) that are effective economically, these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes.  Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges, even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements.  In addition, it is not always possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely mitigate our exposure to commodity prices.  Our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge.  For more information about our hedging activities, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Hedging Activities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

 

The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.

 

The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010, and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, referred to as the CFTC, and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market.  The act also requires the CFTC to institute broad new position limits for futures and options traded on regulated exchanges.  As the law favors exchange trading and clearing, the Dodd-Frank Act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty, or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements, which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us.  The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could (i) significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including those requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity); (ii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter; and (iii) reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives.

 

If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.  Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors.  Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas.  Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices.  Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 

The Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP segment is subject to U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations.

 

We are a U.S. dollar reporting company.  As a result of the operations of the Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP business segment, a portion of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars.  Fluctuations in the exchange rate between United States and Canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the U.S. dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules.

 


Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.

 

Economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries, including the oil and gas industry, the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in reduced

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











demand and increased price competition for our products and services.  Our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region, such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the United States and Canada.  Volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us.  In addition, decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of the CO2—KMP business segment.  If global economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets), or economic conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Some of our pipelines, terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  These natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines, terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines.  Natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers.  In either case, losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.  In addition, our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the acquisition of EP’s pipeline assets.

 

KMP’s tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states.  If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat KMP as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if it was to become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then its cash available for distribution to its partners, including us, would be substantially reduced.

 

We own the general partner interest and approximately 11% of the limited partner interests of KMP.  The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of our investment in KMP depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  To maintain its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, current law requires that 90% or more of its gross income for every taxable year consist of “qualifying income,” as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code.  KMP has not requested, and does not plan to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, on this or any other matter affecting it.

 

Despite the fact that KMP is a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible under certain circumstances for such an entity to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  If KMP were to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would pay U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would pay state income taxes at varying rates.  Distributions by KMP to its partners, including us, would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to its partners, including us.  Because a tax would be imposed on KMP as a corporation, the cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced.  Therefore, treatment of KMP as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to its partners, including us, likely causing a substantial reduction in the amount of distributions we receive from KMP, in the value of our investment in KMP and in the value of our common stock.

 

Current law or KMP’s business may change so as to cause it to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject it to entity-level taxation.  Members of Congress are considering substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that would affect the tax treatment of certain publicly-traded partnerships.  For example, federal income tax legislation recently has been considered by Congress that could eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly-traded partnerships.  Although the legislation most recently considered by Congress would not appear to affect KMP’s tax treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are unable to predict whether any other proposals will ultimately be enacted.  Any such changes could negatively impact our cash flows, the value of our investment in KMP and the value of our common stock.

 

In addition, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation.  For example, KMP is now subject to an entity-level tax on the portion of its total revenue that is generated in Texas.  Specifically, the Texas margin tax is imposed at a maximum effective rate of 0.7% of KMP’s total gross income that is apportioned to Texas.  This tax reduces, and the imposition of such a tax on KMP by another state will reduce, the cash available for distribution by KMP to its partners, including us.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K














 

KMP’s partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted that subjects it to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects it to entity-level taxation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact on it of that law.

 

KMP has adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between it and its unitholders.  The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of KMP’s common units.

 

When KMP issues additional units or engages in certain other transactions, it determines the fair market value of its assets and allocates any unrealized gain or loss attributable to its assets to the capital accounts of its unitholders and us. This methodology may be viewed as understating the value of KMP’s assets.  In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and us, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders.  Moreover, under KMP’s current valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of its common units may have a greater portion of their adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code allocated to its tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to its intangible assets.  The IRS may challenge these valuation methods, or KMP’s allocation of the adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to its tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between us and certain of its unitholders.

 

A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to KMP’s unitholders, including us.  It also could affect the amount of gain from KMP’s unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to its unitholders’ or the general partner’s tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.

 

KMP’s treatment of a purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged, resulting in a reduction in value of the common units.

 

Because KMP cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, it is required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these units.  KMP does so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the U.S. Treasury regulations.  A successful IRS challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a unitholder, such as us, of ownership of KMP’s common units and could have a negative impact on their value or result in audit adjustments to unitholders’ tax returns.

 

If KMP’s unitholders remove the general partner, we would lose our general partner interest, including the right to incentive distributions, and the ability to manage KMP.

 

We own the general partner of KMP and all of the voting shares of KMR, to which the general partner has delegated its rights and powers to control the business and affairs of KMP, subject to the approval of the general partner for certain actions.  KMP’s partnership agreement, however, gives unitholders of KMP the right to remove the general partner if (i) the holders of 66 2⁄3% of KMP’s outstanding units (including the common units, Class B units and i-units) voting as a single class vote for such removal; in such a vote, the common units and Class B units owned by the general partner and its affiliates would be excluded, a number of i-units equal to the number of KMR shares owned by the general partner and its affiliates also would be excluded, and the remaining i-units would be voted in the same proportion as the vote of the other holders of the KMR shares; (ii) the holders of KMP’s outstanding units approve the election and succession of a new general partner by the same vote; and (iii) KMP receives an opinion of counsel that the removal and succession of the general partner would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any limited partner of KMP or its operating partnership subsidiaries or cause KMP or its operating partnership subsidiaries to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.

 

If the general partner were removed as general partner of KMP, it would lose its ability to manage KMP and its delegation of authority to KMR would terminate at the same time.  The general partner would receive cash or common units in exchange for its general partner interest.  While the cash or common units the general partner would receive are intended under the terms of KMP’s partnership agreement to fully compensate us, as the owner of the general partner, in the event such an exchange is required, the value of the investments we might make with the cash or the common units may not over time be equivalent to the value of the general partner interest and the related incentive distributions had the general partner retained its general partner interest.

If in the future KMR and the general partner cease to manage and control KMP, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

 

If our subsidiaries, KMR and Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., which is the general partner of KMP, cease to manage and control KMP, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  In that case, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company.  Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

 

If we are unable to retain our executive officers, our growth may be hindered.

 

Our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard D. Kinder, who is also one of our founders.  Along with the other members of our senior management, Mr. Kinder has been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy since 1997.  If we are not successful in retaining Mr. Kinder or our other executive officers or replacing them, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.  We do not maintain key personnel insurance.

 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock

 

Future sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock by holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares or us could cause the share price to decline and future issuances by us may dilute the ownership interest in our company of our stockholders.

 

We are unable to predict when or whether significant amounts of our common stock will be sold by the Sponsor Investors, holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares or us.  The Class A shares are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock, and the Class B shares and Class C shares may convert into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances.  The Sponsor Investors and Richard D. Kinder have the right to require us to register resales of shares of our common stock received upon the conversion of their Class A shares at any time, subject to certain limitations, including, in the case of Mr. Kinder, transfer restrictions.  Any future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market by our current holders or us, or the perception that these sales might occur, could lower the market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and price we deem appropriate.  Further, if we issue additional common stock or convertible securities to raise additional capital, the ownership interest in our company of our stockholders may be diluted and the value of our stockholders’ investments may be reduced.  We also may issue common stock or convertible securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments.  If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares or convertible securities that we may issue could be significant.

 

The price of the common stock may be volatile, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investments.

 

The market price of the common stock could be volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the common stock due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

 

Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for the common stock include: (i) changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding the common stock, the common units of KMP, other companies comparable to us or KMP or companies in the industries we serve; (ii) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects; (iii) reaction to our public announcements; (iv) strategic actions taken by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; (v) the recruitment or departure of key personnel; (vi) new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations; (vii) changes in tax or accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (viii) adverse conditions in the financial markets or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; (ix) sales of common stock by us, members of our management team or significant stockholders; and (x) the extent of analysts’ interest in following our company.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











We are a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules, and although we do not currently intend to rely on exemptions from various corporate governance requirements, we may rely on such exemptions in the future.

 

A company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company is a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules.  A ‘‘controlled company’’ may elect not to comply with various corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, including the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, the requirement that its nominating and governance committee consist of all independent directors and the requirement that its compensation committee consist of all independent directors.

 

We believe that we are a ‘‘controlled company’’ since the Sponsor Investors and Richard D. Kinder collectively hold approximately 80.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the election of directors, and they have agreed to vote together on certain matters pursuant to our shareholders agreement, including on the election of our directors.

 

Although we currently do not intend to rely on the ‘‘controlled company’’ exemption to the board of directors and committee composition requirements under the New York Stock Exchange rules, we may decide in the future to rely on that exemption.  In addition, under our shareholders agreement, if at any time our board of directors does not meet the majority independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed for trading, we will be obligated to operate under a ‘‘controlled company’’ exemption, to the extent such an exemption is available to us at that time.  If we rely on that exemption, our stockholders may not have the same corporate governance advantages afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.

 

Our organizational documents and provisions of Delaware law we have elected to apply to us contain additional approval requirements for certain changes of control that may inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

 

Our shareholders agreement prohibits us from directly or indirectly engaging in any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination or similar transaction or series of transactions (other than for solely cash consideration) without obtaining the unanimous approval of our shareholders unless the organizational documents and capital structure of the acquiring, surviving or resulting entity preserve in all material respects the economic and other rights (including conversion, transfer, distribution and governance rights as set forth in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and shareholders agreement), characteristics and tax treatment, including on a relative basis, of the Sponsor Investors, the Class A shares, the Class B shares, the Class C shares and the shares of our common stock as they exist on the date of such transaction.  A determination that a transaction meets the above requirements requires approval by each of the following: (i) Sponsor Investors holding a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote for the election of directors then held by Sponsor Investors that hold Class A shares, (ii) Richard D. Kinder (so long as he and his permitted transferees hold Class A shares), (iii) holders of a majority of our outstanding Class B shares, and (iv) holders of a majority of our outstanding Class C shares.  These provisions will apply even if the offer is considered beneficial by some of our stockholders.  If all requisite shareholders other than the holders of Class C shares approve such a transaction, we generally may engage in such transaction so long as the Class C shares receive the consideration provided in our charter.  In addition, if the transaction is otherwise approved by the requisite holders of our capital stock, the Sponsor Investors and Mr. Kinder may decide that the holders of common stock, Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares receive the consideration provided in our charter, regardless of whether such transaction is determined to meet the above requirements.  In addition, our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock, which if issued could include special class voting rights on a change of control transaction.  Also, for so long as the Sponsor Investors collectively have the right to nominate at least five of our directors, change of control transactions will require supermajority board approval.  If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.  Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, referred to in this report as the DGCL.  Section 203 limits the ability of interested stockholders, which are certain stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, to merge or combine with us.  Neither Richard D. Kinder nor any Sponsor Investors that are interested stockholders fall within this limitation, and we have elected not to opt out of this provision.  Accordingly, Section 203 will apply to any stockholder that becomes an interested stockholder after the date of our initial public offering.  These provisions could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish transactions other stockholders might deem desirable.

Non-U.S. holders of our common stock may be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain on the disposition of our common stock.

 

If we are or have been a ‘‘United States real property holding corporation’’ within the meaning of the Code at any time within the shorter of (i) the five-year period preceding a disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder, or (ii) such holder’s holding period for such common stock, and assuming our common stock is ‘‘regularly traded,’’ as defined by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, the non-U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain on such disposition if it held more than 5% of our common stock during the shorter of periods (i) and (ii) above.  We believe we are, or may become, a United States real property holding corporation.

 

Risks Related to Our Dividend Policy

 

Holders of our common stock may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under our dividend policy or any dividends at all.

 

Our dividend policy provides that, subject to applicable law, we will pay quarterly cash dividends generally representing the cash we receive from our subsidiaries less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors, including for general and administrative expenses, interest and cash taxes.  However, our board of directors, subject to the requirements of our bylaws and other governance documents, may amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time, and even while the current policy is in place, the actual amount of dividends on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, capital requirements of our subsidiaries, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws and other factors.  Dividends other than as provided in our dividend policy require supermajority board approval while the Sponsor Investors maintain prescribed ownership thresholds.

 

Over time, our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs, which could affect whether we pay dividends and the amount of any dividends we may pay in the future.  The terms of any future indebtedness we incur also may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our stock under certain circumstances.  A decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of our common stock could result if our board of directors establishes large reserves that reduce the amount of quarterly dividends paid or if we reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends.  This may in turn result in losses by our stockholders, which could be substantial.

 

The general partner of KMP, with our consent but without the consent of our stockholders, may take steps to support KMP that have the effect of reducing cash we have or are entitled to receive, thereby reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends.

 

We utilize KMP as our vehicle for growth.  We have historically received a significant portion of our cash flows from incentive distributions on the general partner interest.  As the owner of the general partner of KMP, we may take steps we  judge beneficial to KMP’s growth that in the short-run reduce the cash we receive and have available to pay dividends.  The board of directors of the general partner of KMP may determine to support a desirable acquisition that may not be immediately accretive to cash available for distribution per KMP Partnership unit.  For example, the general partner, with our consent, waived its incentive distributions from the second quarter of 2010 through 2011 on common units issued to finance a portion of KMP’s acquisition of the initial 50% interest in the KinderHawk joint venture and has agreed to waive its incentive distributions of $24.5 million and $3.5 million for 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, respectively, on common units issued to finance a portion of KMP’s subsequent acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the KinderHawk joint venture.  An example of action we took to support KMP occurred in 2006 when KMP had missed the annual growth and earnings/distribution targets under its bonus plan, which would have resulted in no bonus payments for employees for their service to KMP.  We believed that those bonuses were appropriate and in our and KMP’s interest, so we funded the bonuses by waiving a portion of the general partner’s incentive distribution.  Similar or different actions in the future, even if determined to be in our long-term best interests, will have the effect of reducing the cash we have or are entitled to receive from KMP, and reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends.

 

Our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities above the KMP level or impair our financial flexibility.

 

If we pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities above the KMP level, meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements or fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn.  In addition, because of the dividends required under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business above the KMP level, including through

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)

acquisitions, increased capital spending or other increases of our expenditures, will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing.  We cannot assure our stockholders that such financing will be available to us at all, or at an acceptable cost.  If we are unable to take timely advantage of growth opportunities, our future financial condition and competitive position may be harmed, which in turn may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Further, while the Sponsor Investors maintain specified ownership thresholds, any changes to our dividend policy will require supermajority board approval, which may prevent us from modifying our dividend policy to pursue such growth opportunities.

 

An increase in U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to us would reduce the amount of our cash available to pay dividends.  Further, an increase in individual tax rates could encourage us to conclude that it would be better for our investors for us to use our cash to repurchase shares in the open market rather than pay dividends.  This, too, would reduce our cash available to pay dividends.

 

There currently is much public speculation regarding the future of U.S. federal income tax rates.  We cannot predict whether legislation will be passed and become law that raises tax rates applicable to us or to individuals, or if such legislation were to become law, its effective date.  Any increase in the corporate income tax rates applicable to us will reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends.  Further, any increase in individual tax rates could encourage our board of directors to conclude that it would be better for our investors if we were to use our cash to repurchase shares in the open market.  This, too, would reduce our cash available to pay dividends.

 

If we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to pay dividends.

 

All of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries, and our cash flow and our ability to satisfy obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries, particularly KMP.  In addition, our joint ventures and some of our subsidiaries, such as KMP, are not wholly owned by us.  When funds are distributed to us by such joint ventures and subsidiaries, funds also will be distributed to their other owners.

 

Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and has no obligation to transfer funds to us.  A number of our subsidiaries are a party to credit facilities and are or may in the future be a party to other borrowing agreements that restrict the payment of dividends to us, and such subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions will depend on their respective operating results and may be subject to further restrictions under, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization.

 

The board of directors of KMR, which is the delegate of KMP’s general partner, has broad authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of KMP’s business.  The establishment of those reserves could result in smaller distributions by KMP and a corresponding reduction of our cash available for dividends and our anticipated dividend level.  Further, the calculation of KMP’s available cash for distribution is at the discretion and subject to the approval of the board of directors of KMR, taking into consideration the terms of KMP’s constituent agreements.  Similarly, while the constituent agreements of NGPL provide that it is the intention of NGPL to make distributions of available cash, we own less than a majority of NGPL and do not control it.  The same is true for joint ventures in which KMP owns an interest, such as Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC, Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC and KinderHawk Field Services LLC.

 

The distributions we receive from KMP are largely attributable to the incentive distributions on our general partner interest.  The distributions we receive are not as large if KMP distributes cash from interim capital transactions rather than cash from operations, or if KMP’s general partner waives receipt of a portion of those incentive distributions.

 

As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to receive cash through distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries in sufficient amounts to pay dividends on our common stock.  If we are unable to authorize the payment of dividends due to insufficient cash, a decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of our common stock could result.  This may in turn result in losses by our stockholders, which could be substantial.

 

Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by Delaware law.

 

Under the DGCL, our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of surplus, as calculated in accordance with the DGCL, or if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.  Our bylaws require the declaration and payment of dividends to comply with the DGCL.  If, as a result of these restrictions, we are unable to authorize payment

of dividends, a decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of our common stock could result.  This may in turn result in losses by our stockholders.

 

Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest

 

The Sponsor Investors are in a position to affect our ongoing operations, corporate transactions and other matters, and their interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of our stockholders.

 

The Sponsor Investors collectively own a total of 56.8% of our Class A shares, which collectively represents approximately 47.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock for the election of directors and 48.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock for other matters.  As a result, the Sponsor Investors are able to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.  For so long as the Sponsor Investors own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock, even if less than a majority, they will have the power to determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.  Our shareholders agreement also provides the Sponsor Investors who continue to own at least 2.5% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors with veto rights over specified actions that may impose a regulatory burden on such Sponsor Investors and requires us to reasonably cooperate with such Sponsor Investors and their affiliates to mitigate consequences of such actions.  We also are required to keep such Sponsor Investors informed of any events or changes with respect to any criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving us or any of our affiliates.  The interests of the Sponsor Investors may conflict with or differ from the interests of our stockholders.

 

The Sponsor Investors and holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares have the ability to nominate a majority of our board of directors.

 

In connection with the Conversion Transactions, we entered into a shareholders agreement with the Sponsor Investors and the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares pursuant to which the Sponsor Investors have the right to nominate six of the thirteen members of our board of directors, and Richard D. Kinder has the right to nominate five of the thirteen members of our board of directors.  In that agreement, the Sponsor Investors and Mr. Kinder agree with each other to vote all of their shares of capital stock in favor of those nominees.  Two of the Sponsor Investors each have the right to nominate two directors as long as they each own 5% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors.  Those two Sponsor Investors and the other two Sponsor Investors each have the right to nominate one director as long as they each own 2.5% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors.  Mr. Kinder has the right to nominate five directors as long as he is our Chief Executive Officer and owns at least 2.5% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors.  If Mr. Kinder is terminated as Chief Executive Officer for cause, he will retain the right to nominate one director, which cannot be Mr. Kinder himself.  If Mr. Kinder ceases to be the Chief Executive Officer for any reason other than as a result of termination for cause, he will retain the right to nominate two directors, one of whom can be Mr. Kinder himself.  If Mr. Kinder loses such nomination rights, such rights will shift to the Original Stockholders and Other Management in specified circumstances.  Accordingly, even after the ownership in us of the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares has significantly declined, they will be able to nominate the majority of our directors.  The Class A shares owned by the Sponsor Investors and the Class A shares and Class B shares owned by Mr. Kinder represent approximately 78.0% of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors (with the Sponsor Investors in the aggregate holding approximately 47.3% of such total voting power and Mr. Kinder holding approximately 30.7% of such total voting power).  Accordingly, the Sponsor Investors and Mr. Kinder have not only the right to nominate 11 of our 13 directors, but also the voting power to elect all 13 of our directors.

 

Our organizational documents provide the directors nominated by the Sponsor Investors with a collective veto over substantially all of the actions required to be approved by our board of directors.

 

Our bylaws require that substantially all actions brought before our board of directors while the Sponsor Investors collectively have the right to appoint at least five director nominees will require supermajority board approval, which is defined as the affirmative vote of eight directors when our board of directors has twelve members (while the Sponsor Investors collectively have the right to appoint five director nominees) or thirteen members (while the Sponsor Investors collectively have the right to appoint six director nominees).  As a result, our board of directors will be unable to approve of any action by supermajority board approval if all of the directors nominated by the Sponsor Investors vote against such action.  The inability of our board of directors to approve specified actions by supermajority board approval as required by our bylaws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if we are unable to take action on critical corporate matters.

Our certificate of incorporation and shareholders agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.

 

Our certificate of incorporation and our shareholders agreement each provide that none of the Sponsor Investors, the directors nominated by the Sponsor Investors, the Sponsor Investors’ affiliates and subsidiaries, nor any of their managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members or partners will have any duty to tell us about or offer to us any business opportunity, even if it is the same business or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate.  These documents also provide that none of the Sponsor Investors nor their respective affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities.  For instance, a director of our company who also serves as a director, officer or employee of a Sponsor Investor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisition or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition or other opportunities may not be available to us.  These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are pursued by such a Sponsor Investor or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of by us.

 

The Sponsor Investors and their affiliates may compete with us.

 

The Sponsor Investors and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies, and they may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.  The Sponsor Investors and their affiliates also may pursue, for their own account, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.  We have waived certain potential conflicts of interest between us and the Sponsor Investors.  See ‘‘—Our certificate of incorporation and shareholders agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.’’ As a result, the Sponsor Investors and their affiliates may not be liable for pursuing business opportunities and not making them available to us.  These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are pursued by a Sponsor Investor or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of by us.

 

KMP and its subsidiaries may compete with us.

 

None of KMP or any of its subsidiaries or entities in which it owns an interest is restricted from competing with us.  KMR and the general partner of KMP have the same individuals on their boards of directors, and a majority of those directors are independent.  KMR manages KMP (subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of KMP’s general partner) in what it considers to be the best interests of KMP and its partners.  KMP and its subsidiaries may acquire, invest in or construct assets that may be in direct competition with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.  Among other things, we and KMP have a policy that acquisition opportunities of businesses or operating assets will be pursued above the KMP level only if KMP elects not to pursue the opportunity.

 

Actions taken by our board of directors, and actions taken by the boards of directors of KMR and other of our subsidiaries, may affect the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders.

 

The amount of cash that is available for dividends to our stockholders is affected by decisions of our board of directors and the boards of directors of KMR and others of our subsidiaries regarding such matters as: (i) the amount and timing of cash expenditures, including those relating to compensation; (ii) the amount and timing of investments and dispositions; (iii) our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries; (iv) tax matters; (v) reserves; and (vi) our issuance of additional equity securities, including common stock.

 

Many of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, including KMR, or entities in which we own an interest, such as NGPL, as a result of which conflicts of interest exist and will arise in the future.

 

Many of our directors and officers are also directors or officers of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, including KMR, which manages and controls KMP (subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of KMP’s general partner), and other entities in which we own an interest, such as NGPL.  In making decisions in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of one of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries or such other entities, such person may make a decision that favors the interests of such subsidiary over our interests or the interests of our stockholders and may be to our detriment.  However, any officer or director of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, including KMR, who is also a director or officer

 




  



53







  






Item 1A.  Risk Factors. (continued)


Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-K











of ours, in making decisions in such person’s capacity as our officer or director, is required to act in accordance with his or her fiduciary duties to us.  Further, the organizational documents of many of these entities may have provisions reducing or eliminating the duties of their officers or directors to those entities and their owners, including us.  In addition, our directors are not required to work full time on our business and affairs and may devote significant time to the affairs of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries.  There could be material competition for the time and effort of our directors who provide services to our non-wholly owned subsidiaries.

 

Common stockholders have no right to enforce obligations of the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares and their affiliates under agreements with us.

 

Any agreements between us, on the one hand, and the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares and their affiliates, on the other, will not grant to the common stockholders, separate and apart from us, the right to enforce the obligations of the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares and their affiliates in our favor.  Purchasers of shares of common stock will not become parties to the shareholders agreement.  As a result, holders of common stock will not be able to enforce any obligations under the shareholders agreement in the event that we decide not to pursue any remedies available to us under the shareholders agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 

Contracts between us, on the one hand, and the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares and their affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of arm’s-length negotiations.

 

We may enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares or their affiliates.  Neither our charter or bylaws nor the shareholders agreement or any other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us on the one hand, and any of the holders of our Class A, Class B and Class C shares or their affiliates on the other, are or will be the result of arm’s-length negotiations.  Our board of directors or a committee thereof will determine the terms of any of these transactions.
