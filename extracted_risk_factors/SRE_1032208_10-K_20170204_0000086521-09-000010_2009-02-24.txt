ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Other risks and uncertainties, in addition to those that are described below, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. In addition, the trading price of our securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Res
ults of Operations" in the Annual Report. 
Sempra Energy's cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries.
Sempra Energy's ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends on cash flows from its subsidiaries and, in the short term, its ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term, cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and long-term debt obligations. In addition, the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances, including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress. 
Our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.
Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations and on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt.


17


The credit markets and financial services industry have been experiencing a period of extreme world-wide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention.
Limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult credit markets, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities. This could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.
The availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. If the credit ratings of SoCalGas or SDG&E were to be reduced, their businesses could be adversely affected and any reduction in Sempra Energy's ratings could adversely affect its non-utility subsidiaries.
Risks Related to All Sempra Energy Subsidiaries
Our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation.
In recent years, the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes, on both federal and state levels. These changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses. Moreover, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities. Future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  
Our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the Sempra Utilities and other Sempra Energy operations. These rules are commonly referred to as the Affiliate Transaction Rules. These businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas, or to trade with the Sempra Utilities and with each other. Affiliate Transaction Rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the CPUC before entering into any such transactions with the Sempra Utilities. Any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or trading operations of our subsidiaries.
Sempra Generation has various proceedings, inquiries and investigations relating to its business activities currently pending before the FERC. A description of such proceedings, inquiries and investigations is provided in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
Our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to decline and/or our costs to increase.
All of our existing and planned development projects require multiple permits. The acquisition, ownership and operation of LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and electric generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to operate our facilities, or we may be forced to incur additional costs.  
Our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our profitability.
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection, including, in particular, global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses. Additionally, to comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring, pollution 


18


control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees. In addition, we are generally responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws, we may be subject to penalties, fines and/or curtailments of our operations. 
The scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations, including their effects on our current operations and future expansions, are difficult to predict. Increasing international, national, regional and state-level concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on our operations, operating costs, and the scope and economics of proposed expansion. In particular, state-level laws and regulations, as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, hydrofluorocarbon, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride), may limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The implementation of recent California legislation and proposed federal legislation may adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits and the possible require
ment of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits. Similarly, the Sempra Utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates. The effects of significantly tougher standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth. In addition, SDG&E may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met. We provide further discussion of these matters in Notes 14, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
In addition, existing and future laws and regulation on mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect us. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect us and our facilities and operations. We provide additional information about these matters in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
Natural disasters, catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our business, earnings and cash flows.
Like other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by natural disasters, catastrophic accidents, or acts of terrorism. Such facilities include

§
generation 
§
chartered oil and LNG tankers

§
electric transmission and distribution
§
natural gas pipelines and storage

§
LNG receipt terminals and storage
 

Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues, or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings and cash flows. 
Depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected, any such incident also could cause fires, leaks, explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties, or cause personal injuries. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. Insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, earnings and cash flows.
Our future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us.
Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts defending these lawsuits, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. In particular, SDG&E is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of San Diego County wildfires in 2007, and Sempra Generation is subject to extensive litigation regarding a major long-term power agreement. We discuss these and other litigation in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. The uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, California juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or 
reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. 


19


We discuss these proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report. 
Risks Related to the Sempra Utilities
The Sempra Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities, which may adversely affect the operations, performance and growth of their businesses.
The CPUC regulates the Sempra Utilities' rates, except SDG&E's electric transmission rates, which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates the Sempra Utilities' 

§
conditions of service
§
rates of depreciation

§
capital structure
§
long-term resource procurement

§
rates of return
§
sales of securities


The CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances and penalties that could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the Sempra Utilities' rates, costs, incentive mechanisms, and performance-based regulation in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report. 
The Sempra Utilities may spend funds related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval. If the project does not receive regulatory approval or if management decides not to proceed with the project, they may not be able to recover all amounts spent for that project, which could adversely affect earnings and cash flows.
The CPUC periodically approves the Sempra Utilities' rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment. If actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the CPUC, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.
The CPUC applies performance-based measures and incentive mechanisms to all California utilities. Under these, income potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals, rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings. At the Sempra Utilities, the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety, energy efficiency programs and, at SoCalGas, natural gas procurement. Although the Sempra Utilities have received incentive awards in the past, there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future, or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods. Additionally, if the Sempra Utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms, they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows. SoC
alGas is also eligible for incentives, but is not subject to penalties, associated with unbundled gas storage activities.
The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on transmission investments, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.  
The Sempra Utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how they operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur additional expenses.
The construction and expansion of the Sempra Utilities' natural gas pipelines, SoCalGas' storage facilities, and SDG&E's electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal, state and local governmental agencies. If there are delays in obtaining required approvals, or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals, or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, the Sempra Utilities' business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  


20


SDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities.
SDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, operated by Southern California Edison Company. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. SDG&E's ownership interest in SONGS subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation, which include
§
the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;
§
limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and
§
uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of replacing steam generators or other equipment, and the decommissioning of nuclear plants.
Risks Related to our Electric Generation, LNG, Pipelines & Storage and Other Businesses
Our businesses are exposed to market risk, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond our control.
Sempra Generation generates electricity that it sells under long-term contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets. It purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations. As part of its risk management strategy, Sempra Generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio. 
We buy energy-related and other commodities from time to time, for power plants or for LNG regasification terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity, natural gas, LNG or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.
Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related and other commodities result from multiple factors, including: 
§
weather conditions 
§
seasonality 
§
changes in supply and demand 
§
transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies 
§
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources 
§
commodity production levels 
§
actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with respect to the supply of crude oil 
§
federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 
§
natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events 
§
expropriation of assets by foreign countries 
The FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates, independent system operators, and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate. In 2001, the FERC imposed price limitations that resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices. In the future, the FERC may impose additional price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms, or terminate existing price limitations from time to time. Any such action by the FERC may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. 


21


Business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments.
The acquisition, development and construction of LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, electric generation facilities, and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. Success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things: 
§
negotiation of satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction agreements 
§
negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements 
§
receipt of required governmental permits 
§
timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 
Successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by: 
§
unforeseen engineering problems 
§
construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls 
§
work stoppages 
§
equipment supply 
§
adverse weather conditions 
§
environmental and geological conditions 
§
other factors 
If we are unable to complete the development of a facility, we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project. 
The operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, regasification, storage and transmission systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations.
We may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our sales to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition.
The electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, such as the 10-year power sales agreement between Sempra Generation and the DWR that expires in 2011, our sales may be subject to increased price volatility. As a result, we may be unable to sell the power generated by Sempra Generation's facilities or operate those facilities profitably.  
Sempra LNG utilizes its regasification terminals by entering into long-term firm capacity service agreements. Under these agreements, customers pay Sempra LNG fees to use its facilities to regasify the customer's LNG. Sempra LNG also may enter into long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG, which is regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to substantially reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying supply prices to prevailing natural gas price market indices. However, if Sempra LNG is unable to obtain sufficient long-term agreements or if the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the LNG facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and f
inancial condition. In addition, reduced availability of LNG to the United States due to inadequate supplies, increased demand and higher prices in other countries, and delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity could affect the timing of development 


22


of new LNG facilities and expansion of existing facilities. These conditions also are likely to delay near-term attainment of full-capacity utilization at our facilities. Our potential LNG suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks, which may also affect the supply of LNG. 
Sempra Pipelines & Storage's natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on supplies of natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include Sempra LNG facilities.
Our businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expenses and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.
We are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements. Should they fail to perform, we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.  
Sempra LNG's obligations and those of its suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to 1) suspension or termination for "force majeure" events beyond the control of the parties; and 2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of capital for breach of the agreements.
If California's DWR were to succeed in setting aside, or were to fail to perform its obligations under its long-term power contract with Sempra Generation, our business, results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected.
In 2001, Sempra Generation entered into a 10-year power sales agreement with the DWR to supply up to 1,900 MW to the state. The validity of the power sales agreement with the DWR continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the FERC, in the courts and in arbitration proceedings. If the DWR were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract, or if the DWR fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. These proceedings are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report. As described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we unilaterally reduced our price to the DWR in connection with an agreement to settle other
 litigation.
We rely on transportation assets and services that we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas.
We depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:
1) deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, 
2) supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities, and 
3) provide retail energy services to customers. 
Sempra Pipelines & Storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra LNG also relies on specialized ships to transport LNG to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver our products and services may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current spot market rates.
We cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. Therefore, our hedging procedures may not work as planned.
To reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas, and electric generation capacity. As part of this strategy, 


23


we may use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. However, we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Risk management procedures may not prevent losses.
Although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not always prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Our international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We have interests in electricity generation and transmission, natural gas distribution and transportation, and LNG terminal projects in Mexico. Sempra Pipelines & Storage has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in Argentina, Chile and Peru. We have an ownership interest in RBS Sempra Commodities, which has trading, marketing and risk management operations in Canada, Europe and Asia. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets, and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political, legal and financial risks that vary by country, including:
§
changes in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations related to foreign operations
§
high rates of inflation
§
changes in government policies or personnel
§
trade restrictions
§
limitations on U.S. company ownership in foreign countries
§
permitting and regulatory compliance
§
changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations outside the U.S.
§
adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits, difficulty in enforcing contractual rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions
§
general political, economic and business conditions  
Our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks. These risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies. In such cases, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in increased taxes in foreign countries. While Sempra Pipelines & Storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks, some exposure is not fully mitigated.
Other Risks
Sempra Energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage.
Sempra Energy is a partner with The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in RBS Sempra Commodities, a commodities-marketing firm in which we invested $1.6 billion. RBS, which has been greatly affected by the world-wide turmoil in banking and is now indirectly controlled by the government of the United Kingdom, is obligated to provide all of the additional capital required for the operation and expansion of the commodities-marketing business. 


24


We also own a 25-percent interest in Rockies Express, a joint venture which is completing construction of a 1,679-mile natural gas pipeline at an estimated cost of approximately $6.2 billion. Rockies Express is controlled by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which holds a 51-percent interest.
We have also guaranteed a portion of the debt and other obligations of RBS Sempra Commodities and debt of Rockies Express as we discuss in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. We also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage.
We do not control and have limited influence over these businesses and their management. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
ITEM 1B
