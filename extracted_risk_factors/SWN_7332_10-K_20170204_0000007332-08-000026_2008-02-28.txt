ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the exploration for and production of natural gas within the United States.  We also focus on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as our Midstream Services.  We operate principally in three segments – Exploration and Production, or E&P, Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution:

·
Exploration and Production - Our primary business is natural gas and oil exploration, development and production within the United States, with operations principally located in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  Our operations are primarily conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc. and Southwestern Energy Production Company, or SEPCO. SEECO operates exclusively in Arkansas, holds a large base of both developed and undeveloped gas reserves and conducts both the drilling program for the Fayetteville Shale play and the ongoing conventional drilling program in the Arkansas part of the Arkoma Basin. SEPCO conducts development drilling and exploration programs in the Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma Basin and in Texas.  DeSoto Drilling, Inc., or DDI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEPCO, operates drilling rigs in the Fayetteville Shale play and in East Texas.

·
Midstream Services - Our Midstream Services segment generates revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party natural gas.  Our gathering subsidiary, DeSoto Gathering Company, L.L.C., engages in gas gathering activities primarily related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play.  Our gas marketing subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Services Company, or SES, captures downstream opportunities which arise through marketing and transportation activity.  

·
Natural Gas Distribution - Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Arkansas Western Gas Company, or AWG, operates integrated natural gas distribution systems in northern Arkansas serving approximately 152,000 retail customers.  On November 14, 2007, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of AWG to SourceGas LLC for $224 million plus working capital.  Upon the consummation of the pending sale of AWG, we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations.  Subject to regulatory approval, the sale is expected to close approximately mid-year 2008.
The vast majority of our operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or EBITDA, is derived from our E&P business.  In 2007, 94% of our operating income and 95% of our EBITDA were generated from our E&P business. Our Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments each generated 3% of our operating income and 3% and 2%, respectively, of our EBITDA in 2007.  In 2006, 96% of our operating income and 93% of our EBITDA were generated from our E&P business.  In 2006, our Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments each generated 2% of our operating income and 1% and 3%, respectively, of our EBITDA.  In 2005, our E&P, Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments generated 95%, 3% and 2% of our operating income and 94%, 3% and 3% of our EBITDA, respectively. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Busine
ss — Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income.
Our Business Strategy






We are focused on providing

 long-term growth in the net asset value of our business.   In our E&P business, we prepare an economic analysis for each investment opportunity based upon the expected present value added for each dollar to be invested, which we refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI.  The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. We target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre-tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P projects. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments.  The key elements of our E&P business strategy are:
·
Exploit and Develop Our Existing Asset Base.  We seek to maximize the value of our existing asset base by developing properties that have production and reserve growth potential while also controlling per unit production costs.  Our primary focus is our Fayetteville Shale play, where we hold approximately 906,700 net acres.  We believe our large acreage position holds significant production and reserve growth potential.  We intend to continue to develop our acreage position

by accelerating our drilling program

and by improving individual well results through the use of advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of our properties.  Approximately 95% of the $61 million budgeted for seismic and other geological and geophysical, or G&G, expenditures in 2008 will be allocated to our Fayetteville Shale acreage to acquire an additional 370 square miles of three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data.  This,

along with approximately 525 square miles of 3-D seismic data that we have acquired through December 31, 2007, will give us seismic data on approximately 45% of our net acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale. 
·
Maximize Efficiency through Economies of Scale.  In our key operating areas, the concentration of our properties allows us to achieve economies of scale that result in lower costs.  In our Fayetteville Shale play, we have achieved significant cost savings by operating a fleet of drilling rigs designed specifically for the play. In addition, we are building a sizeable gas gathering system in the Fayetteville Shale play that will allow us to reduce our per unit production costs.
·
Control Operations and Costs.  We seek to serve as the operator of the wells in which we have a significant interest.  As the operator, we are better positioned to control the timing and plans for future enhancement and exploitation efforts, the costs of enhancing, drilling, completing and producing the wells, and the marketing negotiations for our gas and oil production to maximize both production volumes and wellhead price.
·
Hedge Production to Stabilize Cash Flow.  As of December 31, 2007, the average proved reserves-to-production ratio, or reserve life, of our estimated proved reserves was approximately 12.8 years.  Our long-lived reserves provide us with relatively predictable production.  We maintain an active natural gas hedging program on our production to protect cash flows that we use for capital investments.  As of December 31, 2007, we had hedges in place on approximately 102.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production (representing approximately 70% of our targeted 2008 production) and 79.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production.  Additionally, we have financially protected 91.3 Bcf and 3.6 Bcf for 2008 and 2009, respectively, in order to reduce the effects of changes in market differentials on prices we receive on future gas production volumes.
·
Grow Through New Exploration and Development Activities.  We actively seek to find and develop new conventional natural gas and oil properties, as well as new unconventional resource plays, with significant exploration and exploitation potential which we refer to as New Ventures. New prospects are evaluated primarily based on repeatability, multi-well potential and land availability as well as other criteria.  Our Fayetteville Shale play began as a New Venture project in 2002.  As of December 31, 2007, we held 156,465 net undeveloped acres in New Ventures, which includes approximately 88,000 net undeveloped acres targeting the Devonian-aged Marcellus Shale in Appalachia, where we intend to initiate drilling in 2008.
Recent Developments
Senior Note Offering.  In January 2008, we completed a private placement offering of $600 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018.  The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
2008 Planned Capital Investments and Production Guidance.  On December 19, 2007, we announced a planned capital investment program for 2008 of $1.46 billion, which includes $1.33 billion for our E&P segment, $101 million for our Midstream Services segment, and $25 million for our Natural Gas Distribution segment and other corporate purposes.  Our 2008 capital program is expected to be primarily funded by internally-generated cash flow, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or funds raised in the public debt markets, proceeds from the sale of AWG and divestitures of certain E&P assets.  We also announced our targeted 2008 gas and oil production of approximately 148.0 to 152.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 30 to 35% over our 2007 production.
Sale of AWG.  On November 9, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement with SourceGas LLC, pursuant to which SourceGas has agreed to purchase all of the capital stock of AWG for $224 million plus working capital, subject to possible adjustment based on a “seasonality factor” that could reduce the purchase price by up to 2.5% depending upon when the transaction closes.  Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close approximately mid-year 2008.  Upon consummation of the sale, we will cease to engage in the natural gas distribution business.
Amendment of Revolving Credit Facility.  On October 12, 2007, we entered into an amendment of our revolving credit facility pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the amount by which our revolving credit facility could be increased through the “accordion” feature was raised from $250 million to $500 million (thereby increasing the maximum aggregate borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion) and (ii) our subsidiaries (other than AWG) were provided with the ability, without limit, to guarantee our indebtedness.  In connection with the amendment, we partially exercised our option under the “accordion” feature and increased our current borrowing capacity from $750 million to $1 billion.

Exploration and Production
Historically, we have operated our E&P business in four primary regions — the Arkoma Basin, East Texas, the Permian Basin and the onshore Gulf Coast.  In 2008, our operations will primarily be focused in the Arkoma Basin and East Texas.  

 We will continue to actively seek to develop new conventional exploration projects as well as unconventional plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential .








Operating income from our E&P segment was $358.1 million in 2007, up from $237.3 million in 2006 and $234.8 million in 2005.  EBITDA from our E&P segment was $640.5 million in 2007, compared to $386.4 million in 2006 and $325.9 million in 2005.  The increases in both our operating income and EBITDA in 2007 and 2006 were due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices, partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenditures.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of EBITDA with our net income.


Our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves were 1,450 Bcfe at year-end 2007, compared to 1,026 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 827 Bcfe at year-end 2005. The overall increase in total estimated proved reserves in the past three years is primarily due to the discovery and development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas, the accelerated development of our Overton Field in East Texas and our continued conventional drilling program in the Arkoma Basin.  The after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas and oil reserve quantities, was $2.0 billion at year-end 2007, compared to $1.0 billion at year-end 2006 and $1.4 billion at year-end 2005.  The reconciling difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2007 Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our year-end 2007 estimated proved reserves had a pr
esent value of estimated future net cash flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $2.6 billion, compared to $1.3 billion at year-end 2006 and $2.0 billion at year-end 2005.  We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value.  While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.  We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes.  The decrease in year-end 2006 pre-tax and after-tax PV-10 values of our reserves as compared to year-end 2005 is primarily due to a lower market price for natural gas at December 31, 2006.  At year-end 2007, the 
market prices for natural gas and crude oil that were used to calculate our PV-10 value were $6.80 per Mcf and $92.50 per barrel, respectively, compared to $5.64 per Mcf and $57.25 per barrel at year-end 2006 and $10.08 per Mcf and $61.04 per barrel at year-end 2005.  We refer you to Note 7 in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas and oil reserves, to the risk factor “Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K, and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and estimated reserve data

Approximately 96% of our year-end 2007 estimated proved reserves were natural gas and 64% were classified as proved developed, compared to 95% and 65%, respectively, in 2006. We operate approximately 90% of our reserves, based on our PV-10 value, and our average reserve life approximated 12.8 years at year-end 2007. Sales of natural gas production accounted for 94% of total operating revenues for this segment in 2007, 91% in 2006 and 92% in 2005. Natural gas production has generated a substantial portion of total operating revenues as a result of the natural gas focus of our capital investments in the past three years.

The reserve replacement ratio is an important analytical measure used within the E&P industry by investors and peers to evaluate performance results. There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure as it does not reflect the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of the reserve additions. Our reserve replacement ratio has exceeded 300% for the last three years, including 2007 where our results were primarily driven by reserve additions associated with our Fayetteville Shale play. In 2007, we replaced 474% of our production volumes by adding 507.9 Bcfe of proved natural gas and oil reserves and having net upward revisions of 31.0 Bcfe. Of the reserve additions, 281.2 Bcfe were proved developed and 226.7 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  The upward reserve revisions during 2007 were primarily due to improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play.  

In 2006 and 2005, our reserve replacement ratios were 386% (from reserve additions of 365.5 Bcfe primarily driven by additions resulting from our drilling programs in the Fayetteville Shale play, East Texas and conventional Arkoma) and 399% (from reserve additions of 274.7 Bcfe primarily driven by additions resulting from our drilling programs in East Texas and conventional Arkoma), respectively, including net downward reserve revisions of 86.6 Bcfe in 2006 and 31.7 Bcfe in 2005. Of the 2006 reserve additions, 153.6 Bcfe were proved developed and 211.9 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  Of the 2005 reserve additions, 107.4 Bcfe were proved developed and 167.3 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  The downward reserve revisions during 2006 were primarily due to a comparative decrease in year-end gas prices, combined with performance revisions in our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin properties, which were partially offset by an upward performance revision in our Fayetteville Sha
le properties. The downward reserve revisions in 2005 were primarily due to adjustments to the terminal decline rates for wells at our Overton Field and declines associated with our Gulf Coast properties. 

For the period ending December 31, 2007, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio, including revisions, was 430%. Our reserve replacement ratio for 2007, excluding the effect of reserve revisions, was 447%, compared to 505% in 2006 and 450% in 2005. Excluding reserve revisions, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio is 465%.

Since 2000, the substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our drilling programs in the conventional Arkoma Basin, East Texas and, more recently, the Fayetteville Shale play. We expect these drilling programs to continue to be a major source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to add reserves is dependent upon a number of factors that are beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to change” and “Our exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operations of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these factors and ot
her risks.

In addition, proved undeveloped reserves will require us to make significant additional investments. We expect that our proved undeveloped reserves of 526 Bcfe as of December 31, 2007, will require us to invest an additional $995 million in order for those reserves to be brought to production. Our proved undeveloped reserve additions during 2007 are expected to be developed and to begin to generate cash inflows over the next five years. Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors “We may have difficulty financing our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth” and “Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect operations and limit our growth” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operati
ons — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Arkoma Basin 






We have traditionally operated

 in a portion of the Arkoma Basin located in western Arkansas

that is primarily within the boundaries of our utility gathering system, which

 we refer to as the “Fairway.”  In recent years, we have expanded our activity in the Arkoma Basin to the south and east of the traditional Fairway area and west into the Oklahoma portion of the basin.  Our drilling program

in the Arkoma Basin is comprised of both conventional and unconventional activities.  We refer to our drilling program





targeting stratigraphic Atokan-age objectives in Oklahoma and Arkansas as the “conventional Arkoma” drilling program.  Our Fayetteville Shale play represents our unconventional drilling program in the Arkoma Basin.  

At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 1,020 Bcf of natural gas reserves in the Arkoma Basin, representing approximately 70% of our total reserves, up from 577 Bcf at year-end 2006 and 372 Bcf at year-end 2005.


Fayetteville Shale Play.  Our Fayetteville Shale play, which we announced in August 2004, is now the primary focus of our E&P business.  The Fayetteville Shale is an unconventional gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in thickness from 50 to 550 feet and ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet.  The shale is a Mississippian-age shale that is the geologic equivalent of the Caney Shale found on the Oklahoma side of the Arkoma Basin and the Barnett Shale found in north Texas.  

Approximately 716 Bcf of our reserves at year-end 2007 were

attributable to our Fayetteville Shale play, up from approximately 300 Bcf in 2006 and 101 Bcf in 2005. Gross production from our operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play increased from approximately 100 MMcf per day at the beginning of 2007 to approximately 325 MMcf per day by year-end.  Approximately 15 MMcf per day of our production at December 31, 2007, was from 10 wells producing from conventional reservoirs located in four separate counties.  Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 53.5 Bcf in 2007, compared to 11.8 Bcf in 2006 and 1.8 Bcf in 2005.  Our production in 2008 is estimated to range between 90 and 95 Bcf from the Fayetteville Shale.
At December 31, 2007, we held approximately 906,700 net acres in the play area (637,560 net undeveloped acres, 143,740 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale production and approximately 125,400 net acres held by conventional production).  Our leases generally require that we drill at least one producing well per governmental drilling unit (640 acres) in order to prevent our leases from expiring upon the expiration date.  At year-end 2007, approximately 18% of our leasehold acreage was held by production, excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin.  We refer you to the risk factor “We may have difficulty drilling all of the wells that are necessary to hold our Fayetteville Shale acreage before the initial lease terms expire, which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.  Excluding our acreage held by con
ventional production, our acreage position as of December 31, 2007 had an average lease term of 6 years, an average royalty interest of 15% and was obtained at an average cost of $116 per acre.  For more information about acreage and well count, we refer you to “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-K.
In 2006, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved field rules in the Fayetteville Shale, the Moorefield Shale and the Chattanooga Shale as “unconventional sources of supply.”  Under the rules, each drilling unit would consist of a governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators would be permitted to drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of supply.  We refer you to the risk factor “We may have difficulty drilling all of the wells that are necessary to hold our Fayetteville Shale acreage before the initial lease terms expire, which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K. 
As of December 31, 2007, we had spud a total of 699 wells in the play, 601 of which were operated by us and 98 of which were outside-operated wells.  Of the wells spud, 415 were in 2007, 196 were in 2006 and 67 were in 2005.  Of the wells spud in 2007, 410 were designated as horizontal wells.  At year-end 2007, 478 wells had been drilled and completed, including 415 horizontal wells.  Of the 415 horizontal wells, 372 wells were fracture stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel stimulation treatments, or a combination thereof.
Our total proved net gas reserves booked in the play at year-end 2007 were 716 Bcf from a total of 935 locations, of which 497 were proved developed producing, 14 were proved developed non-producing and 424 were proved undeveloped.  Of the 935 locations, 871 were horizontal.  Our proved developed reserves have ranged from less than 100,000 Mcf to 4.7 Bcf per well and the average gross proved reserves for the wells included in our year-end reserves was approximately 1.5 Bcf, compared to 1.15 Bcf per well at the end of 2006 and 0.95 Bcf per well at the end of 2005.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in 2006 totaled approximately 300 Bcf from a total of 434 locations, of which 162 were proved developed producing, 9 were proved developed nonproducing and 263 were proved undeveloped.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in 2005 totaled 101 Bcf from a total of 177 locations, of which 54 were pr
oved developed producing, 6 were proved developed non-producing and 117 were proved undeveloped. If the Fayetteville Shale play continues to be successfully developed, over the next few years, we expect a continued significant level of proved undeveloped reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play.

Since we announced our discovery of the play in 2004, we have progressively increased our capital investments in the area resulting in significant growth in our production and reserves over the past three years.



  

In 2007, we invested approximately $960 million in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included $789 million to spud 415 wells, resulting in reserve additions of 401.6 Bcf.  Previous reserve estimates were further revised upward in 2007 by 67.9 Bcfe due primarily to improved well performance.  In addition, we invested $25 million for leasehold acquisition, $97 million for 3-D seismic, and $49 million in capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2006, we invested approximately $388 million, which included $316 million to spud 196 wells, $29 million for leasehold acquisition, $14 million for seismic and $29 million in capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2005, we invested approximately $119 million, which included $67 million to spud 67 wells, $41 million for leasehold acquisition, $4 million for seismic and $7 million in capitalized costs.  In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which includes drilling approximately 475 horizontal w
ells, approximately 40 vertical wells targeting the shallower conventional reservoirs above the Fayetteville Shale and shooting 3-D seismic over a large portion of our Fayetteville Shale acreage.  At December 31, 2007, we had acquired approximately 525 square miles of 3-D seismic data and plan to acquire an additional 370 square miles of 3-D seismic data during 2008, the total of which will give us seismic data on approximately 45% of our net acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale.

We believe that our Fayetteville Shale acreage holds significant development potential. Our strategy going forward is to increase our production through development drilling while also determining the economic viability of the undrilled portion of our acreage.  Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play is flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation methods, the extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells in other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas and oil commodity price environment.  As we continue to gather data about the Fayetteville Shale, it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage posit
ion should not be pursued at all. We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to change” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Conventional Arkoma Program. Our conventional Arkoma drilling program continues to provide a solid foundation for our E&P program and represents a significant percentage of our total production and reserves.  

Approximately 304 Bcf of our reserves at year-end 2007 were attributable to our conventional Arkoma wells.

 In 2007, we invested approximately $148 million and participated in 114 wells in our conventional Arkoma properties, of which 81 were successful and 23 were in progress at year-end, resulting in an 89% success rate and adding new reserves of 60.6 Bcf.  Prior to 2007, production over the last few years from the basin was fairly constant as new production stemming from our drilling program offset the natural production decline from existing wells.  However, in 2007 we experienced 18% growth in our production volumes to 23.8 Bcf, compared to 20.1 Bcf in 2006 and 20.2 Bcf in 2005. 
Our strategy in the Fairway is to continue to delineate new geologic prospects and extend previously identified trends using our extensive expertise in the area.  

In recent years, we have extended our development program into other areas of the basin that had previously been less explored.



  

One of these is our Ranger Anticline area, which we refer to as Ranger, located at the southern edge of the Arkansas portion of the basin.  Our wells at Ranger have primarily targeted the Upper and Lower Borum tight gas sands between 5,000 and 8,000 feet in depth.  We drilled our first successful well at Ranger in 1997 and as our understanding of the geology at Ranger has grown, the potentially productive area in the field has expanded.
From 1997 through year-end 2007, we successfully drilled 156 out of 185 wells at Ranger, adding 114 net Bcf of reserves.  During 2007, we successfully completed 52 out of 67 wells at Ranger (excluding 12 wells in progress at year-end), which added 25.5 net Bcf of new reserves.  

Wells completed in 2007 had average estimated ultimate gross reserves of 1.1 Bcf per well.





 Net production from the field increased by 67% to 9.5 Bcf during 2007, compared to 5.7 Bcf in 2006 and 5.6 Bcf in 2005.  Our average working interest in the 156 successful wells drilled through December 31, 2007, is 76% and our average net revenue interest is 61%.  At December 31, 2007, we held approximately 81,920 gross acres at Ranger, of which 19,840 acres were developed.  

We believe that Ranger holds additional future development potential.


We began drilling at our Midway prospect area located approximately 11 miles north of Ranger two years ago and, through year-end 2006, we had drilled a total of six wells.  In 2007, we began to accelerate drilling at Midway with the drilling of 26 wells which were all either productive or in progress at year-end.  Our wells at Midway primarily produce from the same productive zones as our wells at Ranger.  Depending on the performance of these wells, there may be significant additional drilling potential on our Midway acreage.  At year-end 2007, we held approximately 31,000 gross acres in our Midway prospect area.
Our conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program continues to be an important focus for our capital program and we intend to conduct development drilling and workover programs that, at a minimum, will maintain our production and reserve base in this area.  In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $132 million in our conventional Arkoma program and will drill approximately 100 to 110 wells, including 40 wells in the Ranger Anticline area and 45 wells in the Midway area.
East Texas 
Our East Texas operations are primarily located in the Overton Field in Smith County, Texas, and our Angelina River Trend area located in Angelina, Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Shelby Counties in Texas.  

At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 353 Bcfe of reserves in East Texas, representing approximately 24% of our total reserves, compared to 383 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 369 Bcfe at year-end 2005.


Overton Field. 

Our original interest in the Overton Field (which was approximately 10,800 gross acres) was acquired in April 2000 for $6 million.  

Our wells in the Overton Field produce from four Taylor series sands in the Cotton Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet.  When we acquired the field, it was primarily developed on 640-acre spacing, or one well per square mile.  Analogous Cotton Valley fields in the area have been drilled to 80-acre spacing, and

in some cases to 40-acre spacing.  At December 31, 2007, we held approximately 24,400 gross acres in the Overton Field with an average working interest of 96% and an average net revenue interest of 77%.  

Our proved reserves in the Overton Field were 315 Bcfe at year-end 2007, compared to 367 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 353 Bcfe at year-end 2005.  

In 2007, our drilling program was focused on drilling our proved undeveloped locations in the field.  We invested approximately $96 million to drill 45 wells at the Overton Field, all of which were successful, resulting in new reserve additions of 6.6 Bcfe.  The 2007 reserve additions at Overton were limited because the reserves from drilling our proved undeveloped locations were already included in our prior years’ reserve totals.  Additionally in 2007, previous reserve estimates for Overton were revised downward by 33.2 Bcfe due primarily to higher decline rates in newer wells than was expected.  In 2006, we invested approximately $155 million to drill 66 wells, all of which were successful, resulting in reserve additions of 88.0 Bcfe, including a net downward reserve revision of 47.2 Bcfe that was primarily a result of comparatively lower year-end gas prices as well as performance revisions in some of our existing wells.  In 2005, we invested approximately $158 million to dri
ll 80 wells, all of which were successful, resulting in reserve additions of 82.8 Bcfe, including revisions.
Net production from our Overton Field was 25.1 Bcfe in 2007, compared to 29.8 Bcfe in 2006 and 26.7 Bcfe in 2005.  We expect our production from the Overton Field to decline over time due to the fact that the field is now almost fully developed and due to the natural production decline in existing wells.
Angelina River Trend. Our Angelina River Trend properties are concentrated in several separate development areas located primarily in four different counties in East Texas targeting both the Travis Peak and James Lime formation. Our 2007 drilling results include a new discovery at our Jebel prospect area located in Shelby County, Texas, in the James Lime formation and are collectively referred to as Angelina.  The Timberstar-Mills 1H horizontal discovery well was completed in December 2007 with an initial production rate of 12.1 MMcf per day and was producing approximately 4.0 MMcf per day as of February 22, 2008. At December 31, 2007, we held approximately 75,755 gross undeveloped acres and 11,456 gross developed acres at Angelina with an average working interest of 72.6% and an average net revenue interest of 55.7%.

Our proved reserves in the Angelina area were 33 Bcfe at year-end 2007, compared to 16 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 13 Bcfe at year-end 2005.  

Through December 31, 2007, we had drilled a total of 59 wells at Angelina primarily targeting the Travis Peak or James Lime formations, with all but one well being successful. In 2007, we invested approximately $88 million to drill 31 wells at Angelina, all but one of which were successful or in progress at December 31, 2007, resulting in reserve additions of 22.6 Bcfe.  In 2006, we invested approximately $40 million to drill 16 wells, all of which were successful. In 2005, we invested approximately $18.7 million to drill 9 wells, all of which were successful.  

The average estimated ultimate recovery of gas and oil reserves from new wells completed in 2007 was approximately 1.3 gross Bcfe per well, compared to 0.8 gross Bcfe per well in 2006 and 1.6 gross Bcfe per well in 2005.  

Net production from our Angelina properties was 2.5 Bcfe in 2007, compared to 1.8 Bcfe in 2006 and 0.9 Bcf in 2005.  
In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $122 million to drill approximately 40 wells in East Texas, including 30 to 35 wells in Angelina.  Of these wells, we intend to participate in up to 10 to 15 James Lime horizontal wells.
Permian Basin and Gulf Coast
Our Permian Basin properties are primarily located in west Texas and southeast New Mexico.  

At December 31, 2007, our proved reserves in the Permian Basin were 60 Bcfe, compared to approximately 51 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 59 Bcfe at year-end 2005.  Our production in the basin during 2007 was 4.7 Bcfe, compared to 5.8 Bcfe in 2006 and 6.9 Bcfe in 2005.  The decreases in production during both 2007 and 2006 were due to the natural decline in these properties, partially offset by our drilling program.  In 2007, we invested $20 million in the Permian Basin and drilled 14 wells, of which 13 were successful, resulting in reserve additions of 11.0 Bcfe.  In 2006, we invested $25 million in the Permian Basin and drilled 12 wells, all of which were successful, resulting in reserve additions of 8.5 Bcfe.  Our 2006 reserve additions were more than offset by a net downward reserve revision of 10.7 Bcfe related to lower commodity prices at year-end and performance revisions.  In 2005, we invested $15 million in the Permian Basin and drilled 16 wells, 15 of which were successful, 
resulting in reserve additions of 4.7 Bcfe.  

At year-end 2007, we held approximately 109,468 gross acres in the Permian Basin, with an average working interest of 37% and an average net revenue interest of 30% in the wells in which we participate on this acreage.  For more information about acreage and well count, refer to “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Our Gulf Coast properties are located onshore in Texas.  

Proved reserves in our Gulf Coast properties totaled 12 Bcfe at December 31, 2007, compared to approximately 15 Bcfe at year-end 2006 and 27 Bcfe at year-end 2005.  Net production from this area in 2007 was 1.4 Bcfe, compared to 2.6 Bcfe in 2006 and 3.9 Bcfe in 2005.  The decrease in

reserves and production during 2007 was due to the natural decline in these properties.  The decline in reserves in 2006 was primarily due to the divestiture of our South Louisiana properties.  During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of our remaining South Louisiana properties to a private company for $12.7 million.  These properties had proved reserves of 7.0 Bcfe and produced approximately 1.1 Bcfe annually.  With this divestiture, we no longer have producing properties in the South Louisiana area.

  

In 2007, we invested approximately $4 million in our Texas Gulf Coast properties.  In 2006, we invested approximately $7 million that resulted in reserve additions of 0.2 Bcfe

which were more than offset by downward reserve revisions .  In 2005, we invested approximately $8 million resulting in reserve additions of 3.7 Bcfe which were more than offset by downward revisions of 10.2 Bcfe.  
We are currently evaluating the potential divestiture of all or a portion of our properties in the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast to help fund a portion of our 2008 capital investments program.
New Ventures
We have personnel dedicated to the research and identification of active and potential plays, focusing on unconventional plays

(including coalbed methane, shale gas and basin-centered gas)

 as well as determining the technological methods best suited to developing these plays, 

such as horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation techniques

..  New prospects are primarily evaluated based on repeatability, multi-well potential and land availability as well as other criteria.  
At December 31, 2007, we held 156,465 net undeveloped acres in areas of the United States outside of our core operating areas in connection with New Ventures that we are pursuing.  This compares to 89,592 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2006 and 116,633 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2005.  Of the 156,465 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2007, approximately 88,000 net undeveloped acres were located in Pennsylvania in the Marcellus Shale play and approximately 49,500 acres were located in Culberson County, Texas, in the Barnett Shale play in the Permian Basin. We sold our acreage in Culberson County in early 2008 for $6.3 million. In 2007, we invested approximately $42 million in our New Ventures program, including $17.5 million to purchase acreage in the Marcellus Shale play.  We also invested approximately $10.5 million in 2007 to spud 25 wells in our Riverton coalbed methane project in Cald
well Parish, Louisiana, of which 18 were successful and 7 were in progress at year-end.  We have approximately 32,000 net acres in this project area targeting the Tertiary-age lower Wilcox coals at a depth of approximately 2,800 feet. Additionally in 2007, we invested $5.2 million to participate in 5 outside-operated Woodford Shale wells in Oklahoma.
In 2006, we invested approximately $46 million as part of our New Ventures program to drill 7 exploration wells, of which 5 were successful.  In 2005, we invested approximately $26 million as part of our New Ventures program to drill 6 exploration wells, of which 4 were successful.
In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $26 million in various New Ventures projects, including drilling 3 vertical test wells in the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania.  
Acquisitions and Divestitures
There were no significant acquisitions or divestitures of gas and oil properties in 2007 or 2005.
In 2006, we sold our remaining South Louisiana properties to a private company for $12.7 million. These properties had proved reserves of 7.0 Bcfe and produced approximately 1.1 Bcfe annually.  With this divestiture, we no longer have producing properties in the South Louisiana area.  In 2006, we acquired additional working interests in our Overton Field for approximately $9 million and also acquired interests in our Riverton coalbed methane project located in Caldwell Parish, Louisiana, for approximately $9 million.  

In total, we purchased 2.9 Bcfe of proved reserves for $18 million at an average cost of $6.09 per Mcfe.  The cost per Mcfe was higher than for prior acquisitions due to the potential existence of future drilling opportunities that were not classified as proved.


Capital Investments
During 2007, we invested a total of $1.38 billion in our E&P business and participated in drilling 653 wells, 439 of which were successful, 17 were dry and 197 were in progress at year-end.  Of the 197 wells in progress at year-end, 141 were located in our Fayetteville Shale play.  Our investments focused primarily on our active drilling programs in the Fayetteville Shale play, East Texas, and the conventional Arkoma Basin, which accounted for 70%, 15%, and 11% of our E&P capital investments in 2007, respectively.  We invested approximately $960 million in our Fayetteville Shale play, $201 million in East Texas, $148 million in our conventional Arkoma Basin program, $20 million in the Permian Basin, $4 million in the Gulf Coast and $42 million in New Ventures.

Of the $1.38 billion invested in 2007, approximately $1.13 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $66 million for leasehold acquisition, $100 million for seismic expenditures, $2 million for producing property acquisitions, and $77 million in capitalized interest and expenses and other technology-related expenditures.  In 2006, we invested approximately $767 million in our primary E&P business activities and participated in drilling 382 wells. Additionally, we invested $94 million for the purchase of drilling rigs and related equipment which were sold in December 2006 as part of a sale and leaseback transaction. Of the $767 million invested in 2006, approximately $196 million was invested in exploratory drilling, $421 million in development drilling and workovers, $49 million for leasehold acquisition, $21 million for seismic expenditures, $18 million for producing property acquisit
ions and $62 million in capitalized interest and expenses and other technology-related expenditures.  In 2005, we invested approximately $451 million in our E&P business, including $35 million related to the construction of drilling rigs, and participated in drilling 247 wells.  

The increases in capital investments and wells drilled over the last two years are primarily due to the acceleration of our drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play.


In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $1.33 billion in our E&P program and participate in drilling between 650 and 680 wells.  The Fayetteville Shale play will be the primary focus of our capital investments, where we plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2008.  Our capital investments in 2008 will also include approximately $122 million in East Texas, approximately $132 million in our conventional drilling program in the Arkoma Basin, and $26 million in New Ventures projects. 
Of the $1.33 billion allocated to our 2008 E&P capital budget, approximately $1.09 billion will be invested in development and exploratory drilling, $61 million in seismic and other G&G expenditures (including approximately $58 million in our Fayetteville Shale play), $42 million in leasehold, and $142 million in capitalized interest and expenses as well as equipment, facilities and technology-related expenditures.  We refer you to “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Investments” for additional discussion of our planned capital investments in 2008.
Other Revenues
Other revenues and operating income for 2007, 2006 and 2005 included pre-tax gains of $6.4 million, $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas-in-storage inventory.  
Sales and Major Customers
Our daily natural gas equivalent production averaged 311.1 MMcfe in 2007, compared to 198.1 MMcfe in 2006 and 167.1 MMcfe in 2005.  Total natural gas equivalent production was 113.6 Bcfe in 2007, compared to 72.3 Bcfe in 2006 and 61.0 Bcfe in 2005.   Our natural gas production was 109.9 Bcf in 2007, compared to 68.1 Bcf in 2006 and 56.8 Bcf in 2005.  The increase in production in 2007 resulted primarily from a 41.7 Bcf increase in production from the Fayetteville Shale play and a 3.7 Bcf increase in production from our conventional Arkoma Basin activities, offset by a 2.1 Bcfe decrease in our East Texas production.  The increase in 2006 production resulted primarily from a 10.0 Bcf increase in production related to our Fayetteville Shale play and a 4.0 Bcfe increase in production from East Texas, partially offset by a decrease in production from our Gulf Coast and Permian Basin properties.  We also prod
uced 614,000 barrels of oil in 2007, compared to 698,000 barrels of oil in 2006 and 705,000 barrels of oil in 2005.  Our oil production decreased during 2007 due to the sale of our South Louisiana properties in the fourth quarter of 2006.  

For 2008, we are targeting total natural gas and crude oil production of approximately 148.0 to 152.0 Bcfe, which equates to a growth rate of approximately 30% to 35% above our 2007 production volumes.
The majority of our gas production and all of our oil production is sold to unaffiliated purchasers.  

These combined gas and oil sales to unaffiliated purchasers accounted for 96% of total E&P revenues in 2007, 92% in 2006, and 90% in 2005.  

In 2007, our largest unaffiliated purchaser accounted for approximately 2% of total E&P revenues.  

Our utility subsidiary, AWG, also purchases a portion of our gas production.  These sales are made by SEECO primarily under contracts obtained under a competitive bidding process.  We refer you to “Natural Gas Distribution — Gas Purchases and Supply” for further discussion of these contracts.  Sales to AWG accounted for approximately 4% of total E&P revenues in 2007, 7% in 2006, and 9% in 2005.  SEECO’s sales to AWG were 4.8 Bcf in 2007, compared to 4.7 Bcf in 2006 and 5.1 Bcf in 2005.  Sales to AWG are primarily driven by the utility’s changing supply requirements due to variations in the weather and SEECO’s ability to obtain gas supply contracts that are periodically placed out for competitive bids. SEECO’s gas production provided approximately 36% of the utility’s requirements in 2007, 41% in 2006, and 38% in 2005.  We also sell gas directly to industr
ial and commercial transportation customers located on AWG’s gas distribution systems.  SEECO also owns an unregulated natural gas storage facility that has historically been utilized to help meet its peak seasonal sales commitments.  The storage facility is connected to AWG’s distribution system.  We

expect future increases in sales of our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers.  Future sales to AWG will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts from them.

   Sales of gas and oil production are conducted under contracts that reflect current short-term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings.  We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. 
We realized an average wellhead price of $6.80 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2007, compared to $6.55 per Mcf in 2006 and $6.51 per Mcf in 2005, including the effect of hedges.  Our hedging activities increased our average gas price $0.64 per Mcf in 2007 and $0.18 per Mcf in 2006 and decreased our average gas price $1.22 per Mcf in 2005.  Our average oil price realized was $69.12 per barrel in 2007, compared to $58.36 per barrel in 2006 and $42.62 per barrel in 2005, including the effect of hedges.  None of our crude oil production was hedged during 2007.  Our hedging activities lowered our average oil price $4.81 per barrel in 2006 and $11.75 per barrel in 2005.
We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2007, we had hedges in place on 102.0 Bcf, or approximately 70% of our targeted 2008 gas production, and 79.0 Bcf of our expected 2009 gas production.  Subsequent to December 31, 2007 and prior to February 22, 2008, we hedged 16.0 Bcf of 2008, 17.0 Bcf of 2009 and 16.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production under fixed price swaps with average prices of $8.99, $8.53 and $8.55 per Mcf, respectively.  In addition, we hedged 8.0 Bcf of 2009 and 2.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production using costless collars. The collars relating to 2009
 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.00 and $10.05 per Mcf, respectively; and the collars relating to 2010 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.50 and $10.20 per Mcf, respectively. As of February 22, 2008, we have hedged approximately 80% of our 2008 anticipated gas production. At February 22, 2008, we did not have hedges in place for any of our oil production for 2008, 2009, or 2010.  We refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,” for further information regarding our hedge position at December 31, 2007.
Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for our gas production has historically been approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices.  In 2007, the difference in our average price received was approximately $0.70 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices, disregarding the impact of hedges.  In 2006 and 2005, widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received to be approximately $0.90 per Mcf lower than average spot market prices.  Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $7.00 per Mcf of gas for 2008, our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges.  Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $70.00 per barrel of oil for 2008, we expect the average price received for our
 oil production to be approximately $1.50 per barrel lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials reduce the average prices received.
Impact of Federal Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas 
Historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC.  In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act.  The Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers of natural gas can be made at uncontrolled market prices.  
The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the natural gas industry.  There can be no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on our natural gas distribution business.
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates 
Sales of crude oil, condensate and gas liquids are not regulated and are made at negotiated prices.  Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil that

allowed for an increase in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser.  The implementation of these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
Competition
All phases of the oil and gas industry are highly competitive.  We compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.  Our competitors include major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us. 
Competition in Arkansas has increased in recent years due largely to the development of improved access to interstate pipelines and our discovery of the Fayetteville Shale play.  The competition for new leases in the Fayetteville Shale play has become especially intense.  Due to our significant leasehold acreage position in Arkansas and our long-time presence and reputation in the area, we believe we will continue to be successful in acquiring new leases in Arkansas.  While improved intrastate and interstate pipeline transportation in Arkansas should increase our access to markets for our gas production, these markets will also be served by a number of other suppliers.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. Outside Arkansas, we are less established and face competition from a larger number of other producers.
Commencing in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders (collectively, “Order No. 636”), which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separately, or “unbundled,” from the pipelines’ sales of gas.  Order No. 636 also requires pipelines to provide open-access transportation on a basis that is equal for all shippers.  Although Order No. 636 does not directly regulate our activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for Order No. 636 to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.  Starting in 2000, the FERC issued a series of orders (collectively, “Order No. 637”), which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  Among other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period, and effected chang
es in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, pipeline penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting.  The implementation of these orders has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations to date. 
We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms initiated by the FERC or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas is sold.  However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other natural gas producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative body. 
Midstream Services
Our Midstream Services segment generates revenue and operating income through gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of our own gas production and third-party natural gas.

Our operating income from this segment was $13.2 million on revenues of $962.0 million in 2007, compared to $4.1 million on revenues of $475.2 million in 2006 and $5.7 million on revenues of $459.9 million in 2005. The increases in revenues are largely attributable to increased volumes marketed, higher purchased gas costs and increased gathering revenues.  The decrease in operating income during 2006 was due to increased operating costs and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities, and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities caused in part by increased volatility of locational market differentials in our core operating areas . 
EBITDA generated by our midstream services segment was $18.8 million in 2007, compared to $5.3 million in 2006 and $6.0 million in 2005.  The increase in 2007 operating income and EBITDA was primarily due to increased gathering revenues and marketing margins, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.  We expect that the operating income and EBITDA of our Midstream Services segment will increase significantly over the next few years as we continue to develop our Fayetteville Shale acreage. The decrease in 2006 operating income and EBITDA was primarily due to increased operating costs and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Business — Other Items —Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA 
with our net income.

Gas Gathering
Our gas gathering subsidiary, DeSoto Gathering Company, L.L.C., or DGC, engages in gathering activities related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play.  In 2007, we invested approximately $107.4 million related to these activities and had gathering revenues of $37.7 million, compared to $48.7 million invested and $7.9 million in revenues in 2006 and $15.8 million invested and $1.0 million in revenues in 2005.  DGC is rapidly expanding its network of gathering pipelines and facilities throughout the Fayetteville Shale region. During 2007, DGC gathered approximately 78.7 Bcf of gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area, including 7.6 Bcf of third-party natural gas. In 2006, DGC gathered approximately 14.6 Bcf of gas and 2.3 Bcf of gas in 2005. The increase in volumes gathered in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to our growing production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale. At the end of 2007, DGC had app
roximately 556 miles of pipe from the individual wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment had been installed at approximately 26 central point gathering facilities in the field.  Gathering revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to grow substantially over the next few years as gathering systems for our Fayetteville Shale play are expanded to support the development of our acreage and the increased development activity undertaken by other operators in the area. 
Gas Marketing
Our gas marketing subsidiary, SES, allows us to capture downstream opportunities which arise through marketing and transportation activity. Our current marketing operations primarily relate to the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party natural gas.  During 2007, we marketed 145.7 Bcf of natural gas, compared to 72.7 Bcf in 2006 and 61.9 Bcf in 2005.  Purchases from our E&P subsidiaries accounted for 91% of total volumes marketed in 2007, compared to 86% in 2006 and 78% in 2005.  
Competition
Our gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users. We also experience competition for our gathering services in the Fayetteville Shale play area from several other producers and non-affiliated gathering companies and we expect this competition to continue in the future.
Regulation
On March 15, 2006, the Department of Transportation, or the DOT, issued new rules pertaining to certain gathering lines. Compliance with the new rules has not had a material adverse impact on our operations. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on our Midstream Services business.
Natural Gas Distribution 

We distribute natural gas to approximately 152,000 customers in northern Arkansas through our subsidiary, AWG.  On November 14, 2007, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of AWG to SourceGas LLC for $224 million plus working capital.  Upon the consummation of the pending sale of AWG, we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations.  Subject to regulatory approval, the sale is expected to close approximately mid-year 2008.
Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment was $10.0 million in 2007, compared to $4.5 million in 2006 and $4.9 million in 2005.  EBITDA generated by our utility segment was $15.8 million in 2007, compared to $10.5 million in 2006 and $11.7 million in 2005.  The increase in 2007 operating income and EBITDA was due to the implementation of a rate increase effective August 1, 2007, colder weather and a decrease in operating costs and expenses.  The decrease in 2006 operating income and EBITDA resulted primarily from warmer than normal weather and increased operating costs and expenses, which more than offset a rate increase that became effective October 31, 2005.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income.  <

Gas Purchases and Supply
AWG purchases its system gas supply through a competitive bidding process and directly at the wellhead under long-term contracts with flexible pricing provisions.  In 2007, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately 51% of the requirements for AWG for 2008, compared to approximately 53% for 2007 and 44% for 2006.  The contracts awarded to SEECO expire in 2009. 
AWG also purchases gas under its gas supply packages from unaffiliated suppliers accessed by interstate pipelines.  These purchases are under firm contracts with one-year to two-year terms.  The rates charged by most suppliers include demand components to ensure availability of gas supply and a commodity component that is based on monthly indexed market prices.  The pipeline transportation rates include demand charges to reserve pipeline capacity and commodity charges based on volumes transported.  Less than 4% of the utility’s gas purchases are under take-or-pay contracts.  AWG believes that it does not have a significant exposure to take-or-pay liabilities resulting from these contracts and expects to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage these contracts.
AWG has a natural gas storage facility connected to its distribution system in northwest Arkansas that it utilizes to help meet its peak seasonal demands.  The utility also owns a liquefied natural gas facility and contracts with an interstate pipeline for additional storage capacity to serve its system in the northeastern part of the state.  These contracts involve demand charges based on the maximum deliverability, capacity charges based on the maximum storage quantity and charges for the quantities injected and withdrawn.
The utility’s rate schedules include a cost of gas rider whereby the projected cost of purchased gas is permitted to be billed to customers.  The difference between actual costs of purchased gas and gas costs recovered from customers is deferred each month and is billed or credited, as appropriate, to customers in subsequent months.
AWG enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations.  Our gas distribution segment hedged 4.0 Bcf, 3.1 Bcf, and 4.2 Bcf, respectively, in 2007, 2006, and 2005, which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply costs by $7.5 million, $7.7 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2007, AWG had 2.0 Bcf of future gas purchases hedged at an average purchase price of $8.61 per Mcf.  We refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Markets and Customers
At December 31, 2007, AWG provided natural gas to approximately 135,000 residential, 17,000 commercial and 192 industrial customers, while also providing gas transportation services to approximately 123 end-use and off-system customers.  

Approximately 67% of AWG’s customers are located in the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers MSA in northwest Arkansas.  In recent years, AWG has experienced customer growth of approximately 2% annually.  In 2007, customer growth was less than 1% due primarily to a decline in employment growth in the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers MSA.

Total gas throughput in 2007 was 23.6 Bcf, compared to 21.8 Bcf in 2006 and 23.2 Bcf in 2005.  The higher volumes in 2007 were primarily due to colder weather.  The lower volumes in both 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from warmer weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years.  Weather in AWG’s service territory during 2007 was 9% warmer than normal and 8% colder than in 2006.  Weather in 2006 was 17% warmer than normal and 8% warmer than in 2005.  
Residential and Commercial.  Approximately 88% of the utility’s revenues in 2007 were from residential and commercial markets.  Residential and commercial customers combined accounted for 58% of total gas throughput for the gas distribution segment in 2007, compared to 56% in 2006 and 57% in 2005.  Gas volumes sold to residential customers were 8.6 Bcf in 2007, compared to 7.5 Bcf in 2006 and 8.1 Bcf in 2005.  Gas sold to commercial customers totaled 5.1 Bcf in 2007, compared to 4.7 Bcf in 2006 and 5.1 Bcf in 2005.  The fluctuations in gas volumes sold to both residential and commercial customers were driven primarily by the effects of weather and customer conservation.  The gas heating load is one of the most significant uses of natural gas and is sensitive to outside temperatures.  Sales, therefore, vary throughout the year.  Profits, however, have become less sensitive to f
luctuations in temperature as tariffs implemented contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases that might result from weather variations during the winter heating season.
Industrial and End-use Transportation.  Deliveries to AWG’s industrial and end-use transportation customers were 9.8 Bcf in 2007, 9.6 Bcf in 2006 and 10.0 Bcf in 2005.  No industrial customer accounts for more than 10% of AWG’s total throughput.  AWG offers a transportation service that allows larger business customers to obtain their own

gas supplies directly from other suppliers.  Off-system transportation volumes were 0.3 Bcf in 2007, 0.1 Bcf in 2006 and less than 0.1 Bcf in 2005.  As of December 31, 2007, a total of 123 customers used the end-use transportation service.






Competition


AWG has historically maintained a price advantage over alternative fuels such as electricity, fuel oil and propane for most applications, enabling it to achieve excellent market penetration levels.  However, AWG has experienced a general trend in recent years toward lower rates of usage among its customers, largely as a result of conservation efforts, as well as increasing competition from alternative fuels that has eroded its price advantage.  AWG also has the ability to enter into special contracts with larger commercial and industrial customers that contain lower pricing provisions than the approved tariffs.  These contracts can be used to meet competition from alternate fuels or threats of bypass and must be approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, or the APSC.
Regulation
AWG’s rates and operations are regulated by the APSC and AWG must obtain the approval of the APSC in order to increase the rates it charges to its customers.  AWG operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law but may not be exclusive within a geographic area.
In July 2007, the APSC approved a rate increase for our utility segment totaling $5.8 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through the utility’s purchase gas adjustment clause.  The rate increase became effective for billings rendered on or after August 1, 2007.  The APSC order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.5% and an assumed capital structure of 55% debt and 45% equity.  AWG had originally filed the application for a general rate increase of approximately $13.1 million, requesting a capital structure using the modified balance sheet approach inclusive of a 50/50 debt-to-equity ratio and a 10.79% return on equity (ROE).  In this rate case, the APSC approved a Trial Billing Determinant Adjustment Mechanism to mitigate the effects of declining use per customer, including lost revenues associated with energy efficiency programs.  AWG’s last ra
te increase of $4.6 million annually was effective October 31, 2005, where the APSC approved an allowed ROE of 9.7%.  Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on APSC ratemaking policies, customer growth, increases in operating expenses and additional investment in property, plant and equipment.
As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation have been required to unbundle residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition.  There is no such legislation in Arkansas and no regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending.  In recent years, there have been efforts by the Arkansas legislature and the APSC concerning the issues of deregulation of the retail sale of electricity and a large-user access program for electric service choice.  Legislation adopted in 2001 for deregulation of the retail sale of electricity was repealed in 2003 and no legislative action has been taken regarding implementing a large-user access program. 
On January 12, 2006, the APSC initiated a notice of inquiry regarding a rulemaking for developing and implementing energy efficiency programs.  Following a collaborative process, the APSC issued energy efficiency rules on January 11, 2007.  These rules require all gas and electric utilities, excluding electric cooperatives, to file energy efficiency plans and programs with the APSC.  AWG has filed and received approval for its initial energy efficiency plan, and is in the process of implementing Quick Start programs.  Comprehensive programs are to be implemented in 2009.  AWG is recovering the costs of these programs from its customers. 
On December 19, 2006, the APSC issued affiliate transactions rules, which were subsequently revised to address concerns expressed by the parties to the rulemaking proceeding.  AWG has filed the Affiliate Transactions Compliance Procedures required by the rules. 
Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by APSC policies, customer growth, customer usage and rate increases allowed by the APSC.  We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on our natural gas distribution business.

Transportation and Other
On May 2, 2006, we sold our 25% interest in NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership (NOARK), a partnership that owns a 723-mile integrated interstate pipeline system known as Ozark Gas Transmission System, to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $10.9 million. In connection with the sale, we assumed $39.0 million of partnership debt that we had previously guaranteed. Our share of NOARK’s results of operations was a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million in 2006 prior to the sale, compared to a pre-tax gain of $1.6 million in 2005.
Historically, our other operations have consisted of the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary, A. W. Realty Company, a company with real estate development activities concentrated on tracts of land located near our offices in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  There were no sales of commercial real estate in 2007 or 2006. As of December 31, 2007, A. W. Realty Company owned an interest in approximately 15 acres of undeveloped real estate near our offices in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and 225 acres in or near Conway, Arkansas, related to our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization.  We have included information concerning EBITDA in this Form 10-K because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure commonly used in our industry.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.  EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to EBITDA as defined.  The following table reconciles EBITDA, as defined, with net income for the years-ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state statutes.  These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of

wells, the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters.  We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks.  Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those in the natural gas and oil industry in general.  Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future.  
The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States’ waters.  A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooper
ate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.  
CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the 
hazardous substances released into the environment.  
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or the RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  The RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.”  However, legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and oil industry in general.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as pa
int wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. 
We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control.  These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and analogous state laws.  Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including w
aste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.   
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA, imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters.  Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants

and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances.  Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters.  Although the costs to comply with zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant, the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.  The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Co
sts may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans.
Employees
At December 31, 2007, we had 1,521 total employees, including 383 employed by our drilling subsidiary and 373 employed by AWG.  None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end 2007.  We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to us and our business. Investors should also read the other information included in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements.”
Natural gas and oil prices are volatile.  Volatility in natural gas and oil prices can adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock.  This volatility also makes valuation of natural gas and oil producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets.
Natural gas and oil prices have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile.  The prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors, including:
·
relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil;
·
market uncertainty;
·
worldwide economic conditions;
·
weather conditions;
·
import prices;
·
political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially the Middle East; 
·
actions taken by OPEC;  
·
competition from other sources of energy; and
·
economic, political and regulatory developments.
Price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving our natural gas and oil properties and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or propose to acquire.  In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for natural gas and oil properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.  Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things, variations in natural gas and oil prices and production performance.  In recent years, natural gas and oil price volatility has become increasingly severe.

A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse affect on us.
Natural gas and oil prices have recently been at or near their highest historical levels.  A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us.  A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would negatively affect us in several ways including:
·
our cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital investments employed to replace reserves or increase production;
·
certain reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flow; and
·
access to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable.
Consequently, our revenues and profitability would suffer.
Lower natural gas and oil prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs.   
We use the full cost method of accounting for our natural gas and oil operations.  Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop natural gas and oil properties.  Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties - net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes - may not exceed a “ceiling limit.”  This is equal to the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects.
These rules generally require pricing future natural gas and oil production at the unescalated natural gas and oil prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges.  They also require a write-down if the ceiling limit is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a relatively short period of time.  Once a write-down is taken, it cannot be reversed in future periods even if natural gas and oil prices increase. 
If natural gas and oil prices decline below levels at December 31, 2007, a write-down may occur.  Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities but do reduce net income and stockholders' equity.
We may have difficulty financing our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth.
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs, particularly as a result of our drilling program. Our planned capital investments for 2008 are expected to significantly exceed the net cash generated by our operations.  We expect to borrow under our credit facility to fund capital investments that are in excess of our net cash flow and cash on hand.  Our ability to borrow under our credit facility is subject to certain conditions.  At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the borrowing conditions of our credit facility.  If we are not in compliance with the terms of our credit facility in the future, we may not be able to borrow under it to fund our capital investments.  We also cannot be certain that other additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  In the event additional capital resource
s are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations.
Working interest owners of some of our properties may be unwilling or unable to cover their portion of development costs, which could change our exploration and development plans.  
Some of our working interest owners may have difficulties obtaining the capital needed to finance their activities, or may believe that estimated drilling and completion costs are excessive. As a result, these working interest owners may be unable or unwilling to pay their share of well costs as they become due. These problems could cause us to change our development plans for these properties.

Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate.
Our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management.  Our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSA, an independent petroleum engineering firm.  In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSA study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates.  NSA’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 81% of the present worth of our total proved reserves.  NSA’s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are the lowest value properties and a
re not reviewed in the audit.  The fields included in approximately the top 81% present value as of December 31, 2007 accounted for approximately 85% of our total proved reserves and approximately 90% of our proved undeveloped reserves.  In the conduct of its audit, NSA did not independently verify the data that we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operations and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production.  NSA has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSA did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. The estimates of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. may differ significantly 
on an individual property basis from our estimates. When, in the aggregate, such differences are within 10%, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. is generally satisfied that the estimates of proved reserves are reasonable.  

Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located.  These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and by the president of our E&P subsidiaries.  Finally, the estimates of our proved reserves together with the audit report of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. are reviewed by our Board of Directors.  There are numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control.  We incorporate many factors and assumptions into our estimates including:

·
expected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments;
·
future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities;
·
future oil and gas prices and quality and locational differentials; and
·
future development and operating costs.

Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates, our actual results could vary considerably from estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves (in the aggregate and for a particular geographic location), production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures.  In addition, our estimates of reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices, severance taxes, operating and development costs and other factors.  In 2007, our reserves were revised upward by 31.0 Bcfe, primarily due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties, which was partially offset by a downward revision in our Overton properties.  In 2006, our reserves were revised downward by 86.6 Bcfe, primarily due to lower prevailing oil and g
as prices at year-end combined with performance revisions in some of our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin properties, which were partially offset by an upward performance revision in our Fayetteville Shale properties.  In 2005, our reserves were revised downward by 31.7 Bcfe, primarily due to unexpected declines associated with our Gulf Coast properties and minor changes to decline rates for our wells at the Overton Field.  These revisions represented no greater than 8% of our total reserve estimates in each of these years, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.  Because we review our reserve projections for every property at the end of every year, any material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent reserve reports.

Finally, recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital investments and successful drilling operations.  At December 31, 2007, approximately 36% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped.  Our reserve data assume that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur.  Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the uncertainty of reserve estimates.

Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect operations and limit our growth.
At December 31, 2007, we had total long-term indebtedness of $977.6 million, including borrowings of $842.2 million under our revolving credit facility.  In January 2008, we issued $600 million of senior notes and used the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility.  At February 22, 2008, we had total long-term indebtedness of $1,063.6 million, including borrowings of $328.2 million under of revolving credit facility.  We currently expect to utilize the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility in order to fund a portion of our capital investments in 2008.  See also our risk factor headed “We may have difficulty financing our planned capital investments which could adversely affect our growth,” above.
The terms of the indenture relating to our outstanding senior notes, our revolving credit facility and the master lease agreement relating to our drilling rigs, which we collectively refer to as our “financing agreements,” impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following:
·
incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;
·
redeeming stock or redeeming debt;
·
making investments;
·
creating liens on our assets; and
·
selling assets.
Our level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:
·
requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital investments and other general business activities;
·
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;
·
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
·
detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally.
Our ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.  If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under those agreements, and in the case of the master lease agreement, loss of use of our drilling rigs.  We may not have sufficient funds to make such payments.  If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to 
pay or refinance such debt or obligations.  The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions.  Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.  We cannot assure you that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.
If we fail to find or acquire additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels.
The rate of production from natural gas and oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.  Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, successfully apply new technologies or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced.  Future

natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.
Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to change.
As of December 31, 2007, we had drilled and completed 478 wells relating to our Fayetteville Shale play.  At year-end 2007, approximately 18% of our leasehold acreage was held by production, excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin. Our drilling plans with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play are flexible and are dependent upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells on our other Fayetteville Shale acreage as well as the natural gas and oil commodity price environment.  The determination as to whether we continue to drill wells in the Fayetteville Shale may depend on any one or more of the following factors:
·
our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation;
·
material changes in natural gas prices; 
·
changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells;
·
the extent of our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells;
·
our ability to reduce our exposure to costs and drilling risks;
·
the costs and availability of drilling equipment;
·
success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities;
·
receipt of additional seismic or other geologic data or reprocessing of existing data;
·
the extent to which we are able to effectively operate our own drillings rigs; or
·
availability and cost of capital.
We continue to gather data about our prospects in the Fayetteville Shale, and it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at all.
We may have difficulty drilling all of the wells that are necessary to hold our Fayetteville Shale acreage before the initial lease terms expire, which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights. 
Approximately 259,000 net acres of our Fayetteville Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases.  As discussed above under “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to change,” our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control.  The number of wells we will be required to drill to retain our leasehold rights will be determined by field rules established by the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, or the AOGC. However, current rules are subject to change and could impair our ability to drill or maintain our acreage position.  To the extent that any field rules prevent us from successfully drilling wells in certain areas, we may not be able to drill the wells required to maintain our leasehold rights for certain of ou
r Fayetteville Shale acreage.
If our Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a significant supply of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost and our commitments for transportation on pipelines could make the sale of our gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
As of December 31, 2007, we had invested approximately $161 million in our gas gathering operations and we intend to invest approximately $101 million in 2008.  Our gas gathering business will largely rely on gas sourced in our Fayetteville Shale play area in Arkansas.  In addition, we have signed a precedent agreement committing us to a portion of the transportation fees related to the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals being built to service the Fayetteville Shale play area by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, or TGT.  Our gas gathering subsidiary has also entered into multiple firm transportation agreements relating to gas volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play.  If our Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a significant supply of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost, and we could be forced to pay transpor
tation fees on pipeline capacity that we

would not be using.  These events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
An increase in the Arkansas severance tax on natural gas could adversely impact the economic feasibility of the Fayetteville Shale play and our results of operations.
The State of Arkansas currently levies severance taxes on a broad range of minerals and other natural resources, including natural gas and oil. Currently, the Arkansas severance tax on natural gas is equal to 0.3 cents per 1000 cubic feet.  There are presently efforts being undertaken in Arkansas within and without the legislature to modify the severance tax on natural gas so that it is based on a percentage of the market value of the natural gas at the time and point of severance, and to have that percentage be as much as 7%. A 1934 amendment to the Arkansas constitution requires a three-fourths vote by both the House and Senate to raise the severance tax. However, if the severance tax increase is proposed through a ballot initiative, a simple majority of the Arkansas voters can approve the proposed increase. The attorney general of Arkansas recently approved the wording of a ballot initiative that would raise the natural
 gas severance tax in Arkansas to 7% of the market value of the gas at the time of severance. The governor of Arkansas has publicly stated his support for an increase in the natural gas severance tax to levels comparable to those in Texas and Oklahoma and indicated that, if the natural gas production industry and the legislature do not agree to raise the severance tax, he may introduce a ballot initiative in 2008. The deadline for submitting the petition for proposed initiated acts to the secretary of state’s office is July 7, 2008, and the petition must contain 61,974 signatures from registered Arkansas voters in order to be placed on the general election ballot.  If enacted, an increase in the severance tax on natural gas could impact the economic feasibility of our Fayetteville Shale play and our results of operations.
Our exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operations of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
We require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage in order to further our development efforts.  Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered.  We invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that leasehold acreage acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells.  Drilling for natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but a
lso from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.  In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return.  Our ability to achieve our target PVI results are dependent upon the current and future market prices for natural gas and crude oil, costs associated with producing natural gas and crude oil and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.  We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects and in conducting our exploration activities.  The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether natural gas or oil is present or may be produced economically.  The use of seismic data and other technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strateg
ies.
In addition, we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy of controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order to improve our overall return.  The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project.  Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, environmental and other governmental requirements and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.
We incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future.
Our exploration, production, development and gas distribution and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels.  We have made and will continue to make large expenditures in our efforts to comply with these regulations, including environmental regulation. The natural gas and oil regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs.  Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights.  These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons we may produce and sell.  In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates interstate

transportation of natural gas under the Natural Gas Act.  Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments.
As an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and oil properties, and an owner of gas gathering, transmission and distribution systems, we are subject to various federal, state and local regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.  These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could significantly increase our costs of compliance, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
One of the responsibilities of owning and operating natural gas and oil properties is paying for the cost of abandonment. Effective January 1, 2003, companies were required to reflect abandonment costs as a liability on their balance sheets. We may incur significant abandonment costs in the future which could adversely affect our financial results. 
Natural gas and oil drilling and producing operations involve various risks.
Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of natural gas and oil properties and the drilling of natural gas and oil wells, including encountering well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks.
We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  However, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.  For example, we do not maintain business interruption insurance.  Additionally, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  These risks could give rise to significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial results.  
We cannot control activities on properties we do not operate.  Failure to fund capital investments may result in reduction or forfeiture of our interests in some of our non-operated projects.
We do not operate some of the properties in which we have an interest and we have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs.  As of December 31, 2007, approximately 10% of our gas and oil properties, based on PV-10 value, are operated by other companies.  Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and our targeted production growth rate.  The success and timing of drilling, development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the operator's expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants for drilling wells and utilization
 of technology.  
When we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular natural gas or oil project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital investments associated with such project.  If we are not willing or able to fund our capital investments relating to such projects when required by the majority owner or operator, our interests in these projects may be reduced or forfeited.
Our ability to sell our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. 
Our ability to bring natural gas and crude oil production to market depends on a number of factors including the availability and proximity of pipelines, gathering systems and processing facilities. In some of the areas where we have operations, we deliver natural gas and crude oil through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.  With respect to our Fayetteville Shale production, we intend to use the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals being built by TGT to sell our production. The laterals are supposed to be available in January 2009. A delay in the commencement of operations of the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals, the unavailability of other facilities due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Any significant change affecting these facilities or our failure to obtain access to existing or future faci
lities on acceptable terms could restrict our ability to conduct normal operations.

Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.  
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. For example, during the last half of 2006, we had difficulty obtaining additional well completion services due to a shortage of completion crews in our Fayetteville Shale play area, which resulted in a higher inventory of wells that had been drilled but were awaiting completion.  There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.  These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.  Higher natural gas and oil prices generally stimulate increased demand and r
esult in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services.  We cannot be certain when we will experience shortages or price increases, which could adversely affect our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations. 
Our business could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.  
The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses, concessions, marketing agreements, equipment and labor against companies with financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess.  Many of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.  Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive 
environment.  In addition, many of our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer time than we have or have established strategic long-term positions in geographic regions in which we may seek new entry.
We have made significant investments in our drilling rig operations; however, we are still dependent on third-party drilling companies.  We also have limited experience in operating drilling rigs. 
We have made significant investments in our drilling rig operations, including commitments to lease 15 drilling rigs and related equipment and have hired, as of December 31, 2007, 383 employees for our drilling subsidiary, DeSoto Drilling, Inc.  The 15 drilling rigs will not be sufficient to meet the needs of our drilling program and we will still be dependent upon third-party rig providers in order to execute our drilling program in 2008 and beyond, even if we make additional investments. There can be no assurance that our drilling rig operations will not have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party rig providers or our ability to secure third-party rigs from other providers.  We may also compete with third-party rig providers for qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our relationships with rig providers. If our existing third-party rig providers discontinue their relationship
s with us, we may not be able to secure alternative rigs on a timely basis, or at all.  Even if we are able to secure alternative rigs, there can be no assurance that replacement rigs will be of equivalent quality or that pricing and other terms will be favorable to us.  If we are unable to secure third-party rigs or if the terms are not favorable to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified field personnel to operate our drilling rigs or to otherwise effectively conduct our drilling operations.  If we are unable to retain qualified personnel or to effectively conduct our drilling operations, our financial and operating results may be adversely affected.
We depend upon our management team and our operations require us to attract and retain experienced technical personnel.  
The successful implementation of our business strategy and handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy depends, in part, on our experienced management team, as well as certain key geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals employed by us.  The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production.  As of December 31, 2007, we had hedges on approximately

70

% of

our targeted 2008 natural gas production.  Our price risk management activities increased revenues by $70.7 million in 2007 and $8.7 million in 2006, but decreased revenues by $77.2 million in 2005.  To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges.  
In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
·
our production is less than expected;
·
there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;
·
the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform the contracts; or
·
a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or oil prices.
Finally, future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded on our financial statements.  We refer you to “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10-K.
Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it more difficult for someone to either acquire us or affect a change of control.
Our stockholder rights plan, together with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could discourage an effort to acquire us, gain control of the company, or replace members of our executive management team. These provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our common stock at above-market prices.
