ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.1Exploration and ProductionUnited States OperationsEOG's operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the United States with a current focus on crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas plays.At December 31, 2015, on a crude oil equivalent basis, 53% of EOG's net proved reserves in the United States were crude oil and condensate, 19% were NGLs and 28% were natural gas.  The majority of these reserves are in long-lived fields with well-established production characteristics.  EOG believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies.  EOG also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio.  The following is a summary of significant developments during 2015 and certain 2016 plans for EOG's United States operations.The Eagle Ford continues to prove itself as a world-class oil field having produced in excess of 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate.  With approximately 549,000 of its 608,000 total net acres in the prolific oil window, EOG continues to be the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford with cumulative gross production in excess of 285 MMBbl of oil.  EOG completed 329 net wells in 2015 and net production averaged approximately 209 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and NGLs, an increase of 3% over 2014.  The combination of self-sourced sand, dedicated frac crews and other services along with continuous well optimization programs have made this play the centerpiece of EOG's portfolio.  In 2016, EOG expects to complete approximately 150 net wells, continue to improve well productivity and reduce drilling and completion costs as well as operating expenses.In the Permian Basin, EOG completed 74 net wells primarily in the Leonard, Wolfcamp, and Second Bone Spring Sand plays during 2015, and evaluated multiple development concepts across these liquids-rich plays.  In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp Shale play, where it has approximately 168,000 net acres, EOG tested 500-foot well spacing in both the crude oil and combo portions of this play with positive results.  The success of the 2015 Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program was due to refined targeting, high-density stimulations and cost reductions, which will make the play a focal point of EOG's 2016 Permian Basin program.  In the Second Bone Spring Sand play, where it holds approximately 111,000 net acres, EOG tested multiple target zones and well spacing as close as 550 feet.  With over 1,000 estimated remaining net drilling locations, this high-return oil play is another integral part of EOG's Permian Basin portfolio.  In the Leonard Shale play, EOG has approximately 93,000 net acres and continued development at 300- to 500- foot well spacing.  Additionally, EOG has approximately 71,000 net acres in the Wolfcamp Shale within the Midland Basin.  Net production in the Permian Basin for 2015 averaged approximately 43 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs, an increase of 30% over 2014.  Net natural gas production increased 27% to approximately 108 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd).  EOG holds approximately 415,000 net acres throughout the Permian Basin.  In 2016, activity will be focused primarily in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring Sand and Leonard plays by completing approximately 75 net wells. During 2015, the Rocky Mountain area experienced reduced activity levels due to lower commodity prices but yielded consistent results.  In 2015, EOG continued infill drilling on its crude oil acreage in the Williston Basin Bakken core, completing 25 net wells. The 2015 development program also included completing 10 net Codell formation wells in the DJ Basin and 13 net wells in the Turner, Parkman and Niobrara formations in the Powder River Basin. Infrastructure improvements allowed for a substantial reduction in lease operating expenses and a much higher natural gas recovery.  Improved efficiencies, lower service company costs both for drilling and completions and lower lease operating expenses resulted in more profitable wells in this challenging price environment. Net production for the entire Rocky Mountain area for 2015 averaged approximately 65 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs. In 2016, EOG plans to complete approximately 35 net wells, primarily in the Powder River and Williston Basins.  EOG holds approximately 985,000 net acres in the Rocky Mountain area.In the Upper Gulf Coast region, EOG completed six net wells during 2015 and net production averaged approximately 54 MMcfd of natural gas and approximately 4 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs.  In 2016, EOG will continue to defer dry gas drilling in the Haynesville Shale, while working to maintain base production and continue its liquids exploration program.  EOG holds approximately 529,000 net acres in the Upper Gulf Coast region and plans to complete approximately five net wells in 2016. In the Mid-Continent area, EOG continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Anadarko Basin, completing five net wells in 2015.  During 2015, EOG's net production averaged approximately 6 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs and approximately 29 MMcfd of natural gas.  EOG holds approximately 250,000 net acres throughout the Mid-Continent area and expects to continue its exploration program in 2016.2During 2015, EOG performed limited development of its liquids-rich Barnett Shale Combo play in the Fort Worth Basin, completing six net wells.  In 2015, net production in the Barnett Shale averaged approximately 27 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs and approximately 272 MMcfd of natural gas.  For 2016, EOG will focus on maintaining base production. EOG currently holds approximately 351,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale.In the South Texas area, total net production during 2015 averaged approximately 6 MBbld of crude oil and condensate and NGLs and approximately 66 MMcfd of natural gas.  EOG completed seven net wells with activity focused in San Patricio, Kleberg and Jim Wells counties.  In 2016, EOG expects to complete approximately five net wells in the Frio and Vicksburg trends, where it holds approximately 272,000 net acres.  Exploration efforts will continue in this region, primarily focusing on liquids-rich hydrocarbons.Net production in the Marcellus Shale for 2015 averaged approximately 24 MMcfd of natural gas.  EOG currently holds approximately 200,000 net acres with Marcellus and Utica Shale potential.EOG has agreements with certain crude oil refining companies to deliver an average of 58 MBbld and 9 MBbld of crude oil in 2016 and 2017, respectively, to certain refineries.  EOG intends to fulfill these crude oil delivery obligations with its Eagle Ford production.At December 31, 2015, EOG held approximately 2.0 million net undeveloped acres in the United States.During 2015, EOG continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Bakken and Three Forks plays in North Dakota and the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.  At December 31, 2015, EOG-owned natural gas processing capacity in the Eagle Ford and Barnett Shale totaled 305 MMcfd and 180 MMcfd, respectively. Also during 2015, EOG continued to use its crude oil loading facility near Stanley, North Dakota, to transport its Williston Basin crude oil production.  During 2015, EOG loaded 81 unit trains (each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 70,000 barrels of crude oil) with crude oil for transport to St. James, Louisiana and Stroud, Oklahoma.  EOG has net unloading capacity of 100 MBbld and 90 MBbld at St. James and Stroud, respectively.  During 2015, a total of 18 crude oil unit trains carrying EOG production were received at the crude oil unloading facility in St. James, Louisiana, which provides access to one of the key markets in the U.S., where sales are based upon the Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude oil index.  In addition, EOG utilized its Stroud, Oklahoma, crude oil unloading facility and pipeline to transport 63 unit trainloads of crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.  EOG believes that its marketing and related logistics processes, including crude-by-rail facilities, provide a competitive advantage, giving EOG the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets.  EOG expects to utilize its crude-by-rail network when it is advantageous.EOG operates its own sand mine and sand processing plants in Hood County, Texas, to reduce costs and to help fulfill EOG's sand needs for its well completion operations in Texas.  Additionally, EOG owns a second Hood County sand processing plant, which processes raw sand from Wisconsin, and sand sourced from the north Texas area, as needed.In 2015, EOG continued to process sand from its Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, sand plant on an as-needed basis.  EOG placed in service an additional sand unloading facility in Loving, New Mexico, during the first quarter of 2015 to support well completions in the Delaware Basin.During 2015, EOG shipped the equivalent of 173 sand unit trains from various sources, to support well completions in the Eagle Ford and other plays. 3Operations Outside the United StatesEOG has operations offshore Trinidad, in the U.K. East Irish Sea, in the China Sichuan Basin and in Canada and is evaluating additional exploration, development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas.Trinidad.  EOG, through several of its subsidiaries, including EOG Resources Trinidad Limited,â€¢holds an 80% working interest in the exploration and production license covering the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block offshore Trinidad, except in the Deep Ibis area in which EOG's working interest decreased as a result of a third-party farm-out agreement;â€¢holds an 80% working interest in the exploration and production license covering the Pelican Field and its related facilities;â€¢holds a 50% working interest in the exploration and production licenses covering the Sercan Area (formerly known as the EMZ Area) offshore Trinidad;â€¢holds a 100% working interest in a production sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for each of the Modified U(a) Block, Modified U(b) Block and Block 4(a);â€¢owns a 12% equity interest in an anhydrous ammonia plant in Point Lisas, Trinidad, that is owned and operated by Caribbean Nitrogen Company Limited; andâ€¢owns a 10% equity interest in an anhydrous ammonia plant in Point Lisas, Trinidad, that is owned and operated by Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited.Several fields in the SECC Block, Modified U(a) Block, Modified U(b) Block, Block 4(a) and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate.  Natural gas from EOG's Trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary (NGC).  Crude oil and condensate from EOG's Trinidad operations currently is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (Petrotrin).  In 2015, EOG's net production from Trinidad averaged approximately 349 MMcfd of natural gas and approximately 0.9 MBbld of crude oil and condensate.EOG completed three net wells in 2015, finishing its SECC Block and Modified U(b) Block drilling program which was initiated in 2014.In 2016, it is anticipated that EOG's Trinidad operations will supply approximately 430 MMcfd (290 MMcfd, net) of natural gas from its existing proved reserves.  All of the natural gas produced from EOG's Trinidad operations in 2016 is expected to be supplied to NGC under various contracts with NGC.  All crude oil and condensate produced from EOG's Trinidad operations in 2016 is expected to be supplied to Petrotrin under various contracts with Petrotrin.  In 2016, EOG expects to complete one net well and install infrastructure in the Sercan Area.At December 31, 2015, EOG held approximately 40,000 net undeveloped acres in Trinidad.United Kingdom.  EOG's subsidiary, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK), owns a 25% non-operating working interest in a portion of Block 49/16a, located in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea.  During 2015, a limited amount of production continued from the Valkyrie field in this block.  Production ceased at the end of the third quarter of 2015, and decommissioning is planned for the fourth quarter of 2016.In 2007, EOGUK was awarded a license for two blocks in the East Irish Sea â€“ Blocks 110/7b and 110/12a.  In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in the East Irish Sea Block 110/12a.  The well, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field.  During 2012 and 2013, the Conwy production platform and pipelines were installed.  Modifications to the nearby third-party owned Douglas platform, which will be used to process Conwy production, began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 and 2015.  First production from the Conwy field is anticipated in March 2016. In 2015, production averaged less than 0.1 MMcfd of natural gas, net, in the United Kingdom.At December 31, 2015, EOG held approximately 7,000 net undeveloped acres in the United Kingdom.4China.  In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China.  In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage.  In 2015, EOG drilled four wells and completed three wells, one of which was drilled in 2014, in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China.  The successful completions extended the Shaximiao development in the Chuan Zhong Block and provides additional opportunities in the future.In 2015, production averaged approximately 14 MMcfd of natural gas, net, in China.Canada.  During 2014, EOG sold all of its assets in Manitoba and the majority of its assets in Alberta in two separate transactions that closed on or about December 1, 2014.  EOG divested 1.3 million gross acres (1.1 million net), 97 percent of which were in Alberta.  Of the approximate 5,800 net producing wells sold, 5,155 were natural gas.  In 2015, net production averaged approximately 15 MMcfd of natural gas and less than 0.1 MBbld of NGLs.Argentina.  EOG's activity in Argentina is focused on the Vaca Muerta oil shale formation in the NeuquÃ©n Province.  Management is currently evaluating options for its investment.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.MarketingIn 2015, EOG's wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline, truck or EOG's crude-by-rail assets to downstream markets.  In each case, the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location.  Major U.S. sales areas included the Midwest, the Permian Basin, Cushing, Oklahoma, St. James, Louisiana, and other points along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  In 2016, the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same.In 2015, EOG processed certain of its natural gas production, either at EOG-owned facilities or at third-party facilities, extracting NGLs.  NGLs were sold at prevailing market prices.  In 2016, the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same.In 2015, EOG's United States and Canada wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets.  Pricing was based on the spot market at the ultimate sales point.  In 2016, the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same. In 2015, a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from Trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on Caribbean ammonia index prices and/or methanol prices.  The remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on United States Henry Hub market prices.  The pricing mechanisms for these contracts in Trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2016.In 2015, all wellhead natural gas volumes from the U.K. were sold on the spot market.  In December 2014, EOG put in place arrangements to market and sell its U.K. wellhead crude oil production from the Conwy field, which is anticipated to begin in March 2016.  The crude oil sales will be based on a Dated Brent price or other market prices, as applicable.  In 2015, all wellhead natural gas volumes from China were sold at regulated prices based on the purchaser's pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments.  The pricing mechanism for production in China is expected to remain the same in 2016.In certain instances, EOG purchases and sells third-party crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities.During 2015, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of EOG's total wellhead crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas revenues and gathering, processing and marketing revenues.  Both purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry.  EOG does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.5Wellhead Volumes and PricesThe following table sets forth certain information regarding EOG's wellhead volumes of, and average prices for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  The table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 Mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.Year Ended December 312015 2014 2013      Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1)     United States:     Eagle Ford181.7 178.0 122.3Other101.6 104.0 89.8United States283.3 282.0 212.1Trinidad0.9 1.0 1.2Other International (2)0.2 5.9 7.1Total284.4 288.9 220.4Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1)     United States:     Eagle Ford27.2 24.7 18.6Other49.7 55.0 45.7United States76.9 79.7 64.3Other International (2)0.1 0.6 0.9Total77.0 80.3 65.2Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1)     United States:     Eagle Ford179 164 115Other707 756 793United States886 920 908Trinidad349 363 355Other International (2)30 70 84Total1,265 1,353 1,347Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (3)     United States:     Eagle Ford238.8 230.0 160.2Other269.1 285.0 267.7United States507.9 515.0 427.9Trinidad59.1 61.5 60.4Other International (2)5.2 18.2 21.8Total572.2 594.7 510.1      Total MMBoe (3)208.9 217.1 186.26Year Ended December 312015 2014 2013      Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (4)     United States$47.55 $92.73 $103.81Trinidad39.51 84.63 90.30Other International (2)57.32 86.75 87.08Composite47.53 92.58 103.20Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (4)     United States$14.50 $31.84 $32.46Other International (2)4.61 40.73 39.45Composite14.49 31.91 32.55Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (4)     United States$1.97 $3.93 $3.32Trinidad2.89 3.65 3.68Other International (2)5.05 4.40 3.39Composite2.30 3.88 3.42 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations.(3)Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements).CompetitionEOG competes with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services, and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil and natural gas.  In addition, many of EOG's competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those EOG possesses and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which EOG may seek new or expanded entry.  As a consequence, EOG may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel.  In addition, many of EOG's larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels.  EOG also faces competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources.RegulationUnited States Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production.  Crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation, including regulation in the United States by federal and state agencies.United States legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  In addition, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry.  Such rules and regulations, among other things, require permits for the drilling of wells, regulate the spacing of wells, prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring, require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments (for federal and state leases), production taxes and ad valorem taxes.      7A portion of EOG's oil and gas leases in New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in other areas, are granted by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and/or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) or, in the case of offshore leases (which, for EOG, are de minimis), by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), all federal agencies.  Operations conducted by EOG on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and, in the case of leases relating to tribal lands, certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations.  In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (via various of its agencies, including the BLM, the BIA and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue) has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties, bonuses, fines, penalties, assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases.  BLM, BIA and BOEM leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and, in the case of offshore leases, orders pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which are subject to change by the BOEM or BSEE).  Under certain circumstances, the BLM, BIA, BOEM or BSEE (as applicable) may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated.  Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect EOG's interests.The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended (NGA), and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  These statutes are administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Effective January 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all "first sales" of natural gas, which includes all sales by EOG of its own production.  All other sales of natural gas by EOG, such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties, remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the NGA, which has flexible terms and conditions.  Consequently, all of EOG's sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions.  EOG's jurisdictional sales, however, may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight, including the possibility that the FERC might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales.  Conversely, sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs by EOG are made at unregulated market prices.EOG owns certain gathering and/or processing facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the Barnett Shale in North Texas, the Bakken and Three Forks plays in North Dakota, and the Eagle Ford in South Texas.  State regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services, but does not generally entail rate regulation.  EOG's gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.EOG's gathering and processing operations also may be, or become, subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of such facilities.  Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and/or adopted from time to time.  Although EOG cannot predict what effect, if any, such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition, EOG could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes.EOG also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in North Dakota and Texas, crude oil rail unloading facilities in Oklahoma and Louisiana and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its U.S. plays.  Regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety, environmental, permitting and packaging/labeling requirements.  Additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered and/or adopted from time to time.  Although EOG cannot predict what effect, if any, any such new regulations might have on its crude-by-rail operations and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck, EOG could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes.Proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the state legislatures, the FERC and federal, state and local regulatory commissions, agencies, councils and courts.  EOG cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective.  It should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions, agencies, councils and courts will remain unchanged.    8Environmental Regulation - United States.  EOG is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  These laws and regulations affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements.  In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control.  Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.  EOG also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such third-party sites.  In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG previously owned or currently owns an interest, but was or is not the operator.  Moreover, EOG is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and may in the future, as discussed further below, be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing.Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, it is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations.  However, given that such laws and regulations are subject to change, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.Climate Change - United States.  Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues.  In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, recent U.S. EPA rulemaking may result in the regulation of GHG emissions as pollutants under the federal Clean Air Act.  Also, in December 2015, the U.S. participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France.  The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions.  If ratified, the Paris Agreement will take effect in 2020.EOG believes that its strategy to reduce GHG emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice.  EOG has developed a system that is utilized in calculating GHG emissions from its operating facilities.  This emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies, where applicable, and on commonly accepted engineering practices.  EOG reports GHG emissions for facilities covered under the U.S. EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule published in 2009.  EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations, laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.Hydraulic Fracturing - United States.  Most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by EOG are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing technology, which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced, enables EOG to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered.  Specifically, hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface.  Hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground, a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers, and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers.  The makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99% water and sand, and less than 1% of highly diluted chemical additives; lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids.  While the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures, a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  EOG regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations.      9The regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements.  In March 2015, the BLM issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water. In addition, there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.  Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions.  In April 2012, the U.S. EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of "green completions" to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air.  The U.S. EPA also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants.  In addition, the U.S. EPA recently proposed regulations that would require operators to reduce methane and VOC emissions from crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations.In addition to these federal regulations, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.  Such federal, state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the United States, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.Other International Regulation.  EOG's exploration and production operations outside the United States are subject to various types of regulations, including environmental regulations, imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which EOG's operations are conducted, and may affect EOG's operations and costs of compliance within those countries.  EOG currently has operations in Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina.  EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.  EOG will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters, including climate change and hydraulic fracturing.  In addition, EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.Other Regulation.  EOG has sand mining and processing operations in Texas and Wisconsin, which support EOG's exploration and development operations.  EOG's sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (in respect of safety and health matters) and by state agencies (in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters).  The information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section   1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95 to this report. Other MattersEnergy Prices.  EOG is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  Crude oil and condensate and NGL production comprised a larger portion of EOG's production mix in 2015 than in prior years.  Average crude oil and condensate prices received by EOG for production in the United States decreased 49% in 2015, decreased 11% in 2014 and increased 6% in 2013, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.  Average NGL prices received by EOG for production in the United States decreased 54% in 2015, 2% in 2014 and 8% in 2013, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.  During the last three years, average United States wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated, at times rather dramatically.  These fluctuations resulted in a 50% decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by EOG for production in the United States in 2015, an 18% increase in 2014 and a 32% increase in 2013, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.  In addition, as of February 12, 2016, the average 2016 U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas prices were $34.97 per barrel and $2.23 per million British thermal units, respectively, representing declines of 28% and 17%, respectively, from the average NYMEX prices in 2015.  Due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment (for example, the actions of other crude oil exporting nations, including the 10Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), the global supply of and demand for crude oil and the availability of other energy supplies, the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the future.  For additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to EOG, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2016 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $65 million for net income and $81 million for cash flows from operating activities.  Including the impact of EOG's 2016 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2016 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $18 million for cash flows from operating activities.  For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at February 25, 2016, see ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. Risk Management.  EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas.  EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk.  See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.  For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at February 25, 2016, see ITEM 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development, production and transportation of, crude oil and natural gas, including rig and well explosions, cratering, fires, loss of well control and leaks and spills, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment.  EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to certain perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions.  Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations.  Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance.Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable.  Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions).  Moreover, in the event an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).  In the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG.  All of EOG's onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors.  The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations.In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations.  Please refer to ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject with respect to its operations outside the United States.Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction.  Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production.  However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis.  11Executive Officers of the RegistrantThe current executive officers of EOG and their names and ages (as of February 25, 2016) are as follows:Name Age Position     William R.

Risk Factors Our business and operations are subject to many risks.  The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial.  If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.  The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.  Unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us," "our" and "EOG" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries.Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile, and the substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on us and the trading price of our common stock.Prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:â€¢the level of consumer demand;â€¢domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;â€¢the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;â€¢domestic and international drilling activity;â€¢the actions of other crude oil exporting nations, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;â€¢weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;â€¢the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities;â€¢worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;â€¢the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;â€¢the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;â€¢the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; andâ€¢the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015 and into 2016, crude oil prices have substantially declined.  In addition, natural gas and NGL prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014, and such declines continued during 2015 and into 2016.  The above-described factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices.  As a result, we cannot predict how long these lower prices will continue, and there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs will not decline further.Our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices.  Accordingly, the recent substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.Lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically.  Substantial declines in the prices of these commodities can also render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects, resulting in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves.  As a result, prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance our capital expenditures and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.In addition, significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values, which will require us to write down the value of our properties.  Such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.In fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices that began in 2014 and which have continued into 2016 have materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our results of operations during fiscal year 2015 and the trading price of our common stock. 13As a result of the decreased cash flow available for capital expenditures, we have delayed our drilling and completion plans with respect to certain of our properties.  These delays may result in impacts to our production volumes as well as cause us to potentially shut-in certain wells and incur associated lease payment obligations.  Such commodity price declines also resulted in an impairment charge (i.e., "write-down") of $6.3 billion in 2015 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets.  Such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 574 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2015.In addition, our 2016 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further.  If commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time or continue to decline, we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock.  Further, if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further, we may be required to incur additional impairment charges and/or make significant additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates.  As a result, our financial condition and results of operations will be further adversely affected. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including "dry holes").  As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: â€¢unexpected drilling conditions;â€¢title problems;â€¢pressure or irregularities in formations;â€¢equipment failures or accidents;â€¢adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;â€¢compliance with, or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; â€¢the availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be affected by (among other things) government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services; â€¢the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and â€¢the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services.Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.14Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities.  Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of:â€¢well blowouts and cratering;  â€¢loss of well control; â€¢crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures;â€¢pipe failures and casing collapses;â€¢uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;â€¢releases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants; â€¢adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters;  â€¢fires and explosions;â€¢terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;â€¢formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures; â€¢leaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression and transportation of crude oil and natural gas; andâ€¢malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations.If any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of:â€¢injury or loss of life;  â€¢damage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs; â€¢pollution or other environmental damage;  â€¢regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs;â€¢suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction; â€¢repairs necessary to resume operations; andâ€¢compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events.We maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.  The occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable.The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties.  These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all.  In particular, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells.  In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery.  Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.15If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels.The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced.  Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced.  Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.  To the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future cash flows and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations.  Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations.  Further, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Specifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment.  These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years.  For example, the U.S. EPA recently proposed regulations that would require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations.  In December 2015, the U.S. participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France.  The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions.  If ratified, the Paris Agreement will take effect in 2020.  It is possible that the Paris Agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products.  EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations, laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.The regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements. In March 2015, however, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity, and handling of flow back and produced water.  In addition, there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.  Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions.  Moreover, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations.  Any such federal or state requirements, restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected.  For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Climate Change - United States and Hydraulic Fracturing - United States under ITEM 1, Business - Regulation.    16We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions.Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may cease to be available in the future or may be otherwise modified as a result of future legislation.Legislation may be proposed in the future that could, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws.  Such changes may include, but not be limited to, the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, such as with respect to the intangible drilling costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation.  We can give no assurance whether such changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed and, if enacted, how soon any such changes would become effective.  The enactment of any such changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic.  If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners.  As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties.  Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects.  In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices.  These limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties.  Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential.  Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements.  In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties.  Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates.  In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.17We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves.  We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of non-core assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings.  Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, reduce our cash flows.  The lower commodity price environment could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned non-core asset sales and divestitures. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all.  Weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions and a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings.  A reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of continued lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay.  In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to obtain financings and the terms of any financings are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies.  Factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels; planned asset purchases or sales; near-term and long-term production growth opportunities; liquidity; asset quality; cost structure; product mix; and commodity pricing levels (including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices).  In February 2016, Standard & Poorâ€™s Ratings Services (an independent credit rating agency), as a result of its lowered assumptions with respect to future commodity prices, lowered its credit ratings of several investment grade-rated U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies, including its rating of our long-term debt.  We expect Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, Inc. (also an independent credit rating agency) will take similar action in the near future with respect to its ratings of our debt and its ratings of the debt of other U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies.  Such ratings downgrades could increase our borrowing costs and may adversely impact our ability to access financings.  In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future, nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be further lowered. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us.We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions.  Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, while weakened in recent years, have improved somewhat.  However, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and a depressed commodity price environment, and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit.  These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes.  Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions.  Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions.The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.18Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil and natural gas.  In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry.  As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel.  In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels.  We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources.Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate.  Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process.  It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants.  Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated.  Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas.  We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.  The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control.  Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates.  Any significant variance, including any significant revisions or "write-downs" to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.  For related discussion, see ITEM 2, Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves and Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations.  For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment.  Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services.  Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.19Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.We use derivative instruments (primarily financial price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows.  To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts.  Our forecasted natural gas production for 2016 is currently approximately 4% hedged at approximately $2.49 per million British thermal units, and none of our forecasted crude oil production for 2016 is currently hedged.  As a result, a significant portion of our forecasted production for 2016 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices. If we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2016 and beyond, we will be impacted by further commodity price declines, which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities.  In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. Federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities. As discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows.  In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors (the Prudential Regulators)  adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities.  Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued numerous rules, including a rule establishing an "end-user" exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and a proposed rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule).We qualify as a "non-financial entity" for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we are eligible for, and expect to utilize, such exception.  As a result, our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing.  We also qualify as a "non-financial entity" for purposes of the Margin Rule; therefore, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements.  Finally, we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the Position Limits Rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted.  However, many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the End-User Exception, may be subject to mandatory clearing or the Margin Rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and/or may be subject to the Position Limits Rule.  In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives (collectively, Foreign Regulations) which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations.The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules adopted thereunder and the Foreign Regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.  If our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulations or the Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for, and fund, our capital expenditure requirements.  Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.  The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.20We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations.  These risks include, among other risks: â€¢increases in taxes and governmental royalties;â€¢changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;â€¢loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; â€¢unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; â€¢difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and â€¢currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation.  The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar.  However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates.  Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency.  These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, less than 1% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar.Our business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats.As a producer of crude oil and natural gas, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, refineries, rail facilities and pipelines. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to our operations.  Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information, systems, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information or facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets.  The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations.  Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.21ITEM 1B
