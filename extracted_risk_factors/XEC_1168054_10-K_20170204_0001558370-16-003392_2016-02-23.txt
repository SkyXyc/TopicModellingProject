ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
		
		
			The following risks and uncertainties, together with other information set forth in this Form 10-K, should be carefully considered by current and future investors in our securities. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties presently unknown to us or currently deemed immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and the results of our operations, which in turn could negatively impact the value of our securities.
		
		
			Oil, gas, and NGL prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors, creating a component of uncertainty in our development plans and overall operations. Declines in prices adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth in proved reserves and production.
		
		
			Oil and gas markets are volatile. We cannot predict future prices. The prices we receive for our production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. The prices we receive depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in domestic and global supply and demand for oil and gas, the level of domestic and global oil and gas exploration and production activity, geopolitical instability, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, weather conditions, technological advances affecting energy consumption, governmental regulations and taxes, and the price and technological advancement of alternative fuels.
		
		
			Our proved oil and gas reserves and production volumes will decrease unless those reserves are replaced with new discoveries or acquisitions. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we expect to make substantial capital investments for the exploration and development of new oil and gas reserves. Historically, we have paid for these types of capital expenditures with cash flow provided by our production operations, our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of senior notes or equity. Low prices reduce our cash flow and the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and may cause us to curtail, delay, or defer certain exploration and development projects. Moreover, low prices also may impact our abilities to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund acquisitions.
		
		
			If prices stay at recent lower levels or decrease, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties and/or our goodwill.
		
		
			Accounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and goodwill for possible impairment. 
		
		
			As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to a ceiling test exceeded the calculated value of the ceiling limitation and impairment was necessary. If pricing conditions stay at current levels or decline further we will incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters.  Because the ceiling calculation uses rolling 12-month average commodity prices, the effect of lower quarter-over-quarter prices in 2016 compared to 2015 is a lower ceiling value each quarter.  This will result in ongoing impairments each quarter until prices stabilize or improve.  Impairment charges do not affect cash flow from operating activities, but do adversely affect our net income and various components of our balance sheet.
		
		
			U.S. or global financial markets may impact our business and financial condition.
		
		
			A credit crisis or other turmoil in the U.S. or global financial system may have a negative impact on our business and our financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. This could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions could have a negative impact on our lenders, the purchasers of our oil and gas production and the working interest owners in properties we operate, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.

Failure to economically replace oil and gas reserves could negatively affect our financial results and future rate of growth.
		
		
			In order to replace the reserves depleted by production and to maintain or increase our total proved reserves and overall production levels, we must either locate and develop new oil and gas reserves or acquire producing properties from others. This requires significant capital expenditures and can impose reinvestment risk for us, as we may not be able to continue to replace our reserves economically. While we occasionally may seek to acquire proved reserves, our main business strategy is to grow through exploration and drilling. Without successful exploration and development, our reserves, production and revenues could decline rapidly, which would negatively impact the results of our operations.
		
		
			Exploration and development involves numerous risks, including new governmental regulations and the risk that we will not discover any commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Additionally, it can be unprofitable, not only from drilling dry holes, but also from drilling productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient reserves or declines in commodity prices.
		
		
			Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled for many reasons. Factors such as unforeseen poor drilling conditions, title problems, unexpected pressure irregularities, equipment failures, accidents, adverse weather conditions, compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, bans, moratoria or other restrictions implemented by local governments and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling and completion services could negatively impact our drilling operations.
		
		
			Our proved reserve estimates may be inaccurate and future net cash flows are uncertain.
		
		
			Estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves (consisting of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves) and associated future net cash flow depend on a number of variables and assumptions. See “Forward-Looking Statement” in this report. Among others, changes in any of the following factors may cause actual results to vary considerably from our estimates:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			timing of development expenditures;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			amount of required capital expenditures and associated economics;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			recovery efficiencies, decline rates, drainage areas, and reservoir limits;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			anticipated reservoir and production characteristics and interpretations of geologic and geophysical data;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			production rates, reservoir pressure, unexpected water encroachment, and other subsurface conditions;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			oil, gas, and NGL prices;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			governmental regulation;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			access to assets restricted by local government action;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			operating costs;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			property, severance, excise and other taxes incidental to oil and gas operations;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			workover and remediation costs; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			federal and state income taxes.
		
			Our proved oil and gas reserve estimates are prepared by Cimarex engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers, reviewed our reserve estimates for properties that comprised at least 80% of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes, using a 10% discount rate, as of December 31, 2015.

The cash flow amounts referred to in this filing should not be construed as the current market value of our proved reserves. In accordance with SEC guidelines, the estimated discounted net cash flow from proved reserves is based on the average of the previous 12 months' first-day-of-the-month prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially different.
		
		
			Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.
		
		
			To limit our exposure to price risk, we enter into hedging agreements from time to time, and use commodity derivatives.  Hedges limit volatility and increase the predictability of a portion of our cash flow. These transactions also limit our potential gains when oil and gas prices exceed the prices established by the hedges.
		
		
			In certain circumstances, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss, including instances in which:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			there is a sudden unexpected event that materially increases oil and natural gas prices; or
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement.
		
			Because we account for derivative contracts under mark-to-market accounting, during periods we have hedging transactions in place we expect continued volatility in derivative gains or losses on our income statement as changes occur in the relevant price indexes.
		
		
			The adoption of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.
		
		
			In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an extensive overhaul of the framework for regulation of U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act called for various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to establish regulations for implementation of many of its provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant derivatives regulations, including requirements that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and that cash collateral (margin) be posted for such transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for an exemption from the clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users, such as Cimarex, and it includes a number of defined terms used in determining how this exemption applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.
		
		
			We have satisfied the requirements for the commercial end-user exception to the clearing requirement and intend to continue to engage in derivative transactions. In December 2015, the CFTC approved final rules on margin requirements that will have an impact on our hedging counterparties and an interim final rule exemption from the margin requirements for certain uncleared swaps with commercial end-users.  The final rules did not impose additional requirements on commercial end-users.  The ultimate effect of these new rules and any additional regulations is currently uncertain. New rules and regulations in this area may result in significant increased costs and disclosure obligations as well as decreased liquidity as entities that previously served as hedge counterparties exit the market.

We have been an early entrant into new or emerging resource plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain. The value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and we may incur impairment charges if drilling results are unsuccessful.
		
		
			New or emerging oil and gas resource plays have limited or no production history. Consequently, in those areas it is difficult to predict our future drilling costs and results. Therefore, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected. Similarly, our production may be lower than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if our results are unsuccessful. As a result, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays.
		
		
			Furthermore, unless production is established during the primary term of certain of our undeveloped oil and gas leases, the leases will expire, and we will lose our right to develop those properties.
		
		
			Our business depends on oil and gas pipeline and transportation facilities, some of which are owned by others.
		
		
			In addition to the existence of adequate markets, our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the proximity and capacity of pipeline systems, as well as storage, transportation, processing and fractionation facilities, most of which are owned by third parties. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. This is more likely in remote areas without established infrastructure, such as our Culberson County, Texas area where we have significant development activities. The lack of availability or capacity in these facilities or the loss of these facilities due to weather, fire or other reasons, for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues.
		
		
			A limited number of companies purchase a majority of our oil, NGLs and natural gas. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell production.
		
		
			Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas, local government activity, adverse court rulings, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.
		
		
			Competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and technological resources.
		
		
			We operate in the competitive area of oil and gas exploration and production. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have larger operating staffs and greater capital resources. These competitors may be willing to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and gas properties. They may also be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
		
		
			Because our activity is also concentrated in areas of heavy industry competition, there is heightened demand for personnel, equipment, power, services, facilities and resources, resulting in higher costs than in other areas. Such intense competition also could result in delays in securing, or the inability to secure, the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources or facilities necessary for our development activities, which could negatively impact our production volumes.  We also face higher costs in remote areas where vendors can charge higher rates due to that remoteness along with the inability to attract employees to those areas and the ability to deploy their resources in easier to access areas.
		
		
			We are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.
		
		
			Exploration, production and the sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including those implemented to protect the environment, human health and safety and wildlife. Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies frequently require permitting and impose conditions on our activities. During the permitting process, these regulatory agencies often exercise considerable discretion in both the timing and scope of the permits, and the public, including special interest groups, often has an opportunity to influence the timing and outcome of the process. The requirements or conditions imposed by these agencies can be costly and can delay the commencement of our operations.  In addition, a number of initiatives have been put forth by the President Obama administration not in the form of regulation but rather as Presidential or Secretarial Memoranda which have the potential to impact the cost of doing business or could result in

substantial delays in permitting, drilling and other oil and gas activities.  One example is the Presidential Memorandum on “no net loss” which will take the form of agency action by the Department of Interior, EPA and other agencies to ensure that harmful effects to lands are avoided, minimized and those which remain mitigated up to and including prohibiting actions which may have been previously allowed or requiring compensation.
		
		
			Failing to comply with any of the applicable laws and regulations, or Presidential initiatives, could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal liabilities and penalties. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on both our financial condition and operations.
		
		
			Environmental matters and costs can be significant.
		
		
			As an owner, lessee, or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various complex, stringent and constantly evolving environmental laws and regulations. Our operations inherently create the risk of environmental liability to the government and private parties stemming from our use, generation, handling and disposal of water and waste materials, as well as the release of hydrocarbons or other substances into the air, soil, or water. The environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including:  the acquisition of permits before conducting regulated activities associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas; the restriction of types, quantities, and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, waters of the United States, and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.
		
		
			Liabilities under certain environmental laws can be joint and several and may in some cases be imposed regardless of fault on our part such as where we own a working interest in a property operated by another party. We also could be held liable for damages or remediating lands or facilities previously owned or operated by others regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions and regardless if we were in compliance with all applicable law at the time. Further, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Since these environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and can result in substantial costs, such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on both our financial condition and operations.
		
		
			Our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we incur costs and liabilities due to a failure to comply with environmental regulations or a release of hazardous substances into the environment.
		
		
			Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, discharge, transportation and disposal of pollutants and solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The most significant of these environmental laws are as follows: 
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States;

			Table of Contents

		


		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, and comparable state statutes, which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), which governs the discharge of pollutants, including natural gas wastes into federal and state waters; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			The Clean Air Act (CAA) which governs the emission of pollutants into the air.
		
			We believe we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA, CWA, SDWA, CAA and related state and local laws and regulations. We also believe we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although the current costs of managing our wastes as they presently are classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
		
		
			Federal regulatory initiatives relating to the protection of threatened or endangered species could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
		
		
			The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on federal oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species are currently listed as threatened or endangered, or could be listed as such, under the ESA. Operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may restrict or preclude our drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. On March 27, 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, where we conduct operations, as a threatened species under the ESA. Listing of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species imposes restrictions on disturbances to critical habitat by landowners and drilling companies that would harass, harm or otherwise result in a "taking" of this species. However, the FWS also announced a final rule that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing if those landowners and businesses have entered into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements, such as those developed by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), pursuant to which such parties agreed to take steps to protect the lesser prairie chicken's habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if its actions harm the lesser prairie chicken's habitat. We entered into a voluntary Candidate Conservation Agreement (CCA) with the WAFWA, whereby we agreed to take certain actions and limit certain activities, such as limiting drilling on certain portions of our acreage during nesting seasons, in an effort to protect the lesser prairie chicken. Such CCA could result in increased costs to us from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on drilling activities, which costs, delays or limitations may be significant.   While a federal judge in Texas vacated the listing of the lesser prairie chicken in 2015, listing petitions continue to be filed with the FWS which could impact our operations.  Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work closely with the FWS regarding the listing of many species, including species with broad and even nationwide ranges.  The recent listing of the Mexican Long Nosed bat, whose habitat includes the Permian Basin where we operate, is an example of the NGOs’ influence on ESA listing decisions.  The increase in endangered species listings may impact our ability to explore for or produce oil and gas in certain areas and increase our costs. 
		
		
			Our hydraulic fracturing activities are subject to risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.
		
		
			We use hydraulic fracturing for the completion of almost all of our wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping fluid and proppant at high pressure into a hydrocarbon bearing formation to create and hold open fractures. Those fractures enable gas or oil to move through the formation's pores to the well bore. Typically, the fluid

			Table of Contents

		

used in this process is primarily water. In plays where hydraulic fracturing is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. A lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs.
		
		
			While hydraulic fracturing historically has been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation from federal agencies. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the SDWA involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Although the EPA has delegated the permitting authority for the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control Class II programs in Oklahoma, Texas or New Mexico where we maintain operational acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of such draft guidance. Also, the EPA is updating chloride water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act, which criteria are used by states for establishing acceptable discharge limits. The EPA is expected to release draft criteria in early 2016. On April 7, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule requiring federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water with some resulting “flowback water” as well as “produced water.” If adopted, the new pretreatment rules will require shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities.  The public comment period for the proposed rates ended on June 8, 2015 and final rules have not yet been issued. Moreover, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the disclosure of information related to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014.
		
		
			In addition, on March 26, 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that wells used in fracturing operations meet appropriate construction standards, development of appropriate plans for managing flowback water that returns to the surface, increased standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids, and submission to the Bureau of Land Management of detailed information on the geology, depth and location of preexisting wells.  This rule originally was scheduled to take effect on June 24, 2015.  However, the rule is the subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups, two Indian tribes, and at least four states, alleging that federal law does not give the Bureau of Land Management authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The federal judge has enjoined the rule until the merits of the case can be heard sometime in 2016. 
		
		
			There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA’s draft report was released on June 4, 2015.  The findings of the report suggest that hydraulic fracturing does not pose a systemic risk to groundwater although there are risks to both groundwater and soils posed by inadequate water handling practices in certain situations.  A public comment period on the report was open until August 28, 2015 and a series of public hearings were conducted by the EPA’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) throughout the fall of 2015.  The EPA issued its final report and concluded there is no evidence of widespread contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing.  The SAB has indicated that they want to continue to study the matter.  Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
		
		
			Additionally, Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Most producing states, including Texas and Colorado, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  
		
		
			Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may

preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays as well as potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.
		
		
			Air quality regulations could negatively impact our operations and profitability.
		
		
			In August 2012, the EPA adopted rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. The rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community.  In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration.  In addition, on January 14, 2015, the EPA announced a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming VOC emissions from the oil and gas industry. Proposed rules implementing the various elements of the package were published in September 2015 and the public comment period ended in December 2015.  These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.  
		
		
			The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
		
		
			Studies have suggested that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be impacting the earth's climate. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, also present in natural gas as a secondary product, sometimes considered an impurity or a by-product of the burning of oil and natural gas, are examples of GHGs. The U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of GHGs. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD and/or Title V permits under EPA’s GHG Tailoring Rule for their GHG emissions also may be required to meet "Best Available Control Technology" standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations.  In recent proposed rulemaking EPA is widening the scope of annual GHG reporting to include not only activities associated with completion and workover of gas wells with hydraulic fracturing and activities associated with oil and natural gas production operations, but also completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing, gathering and boosting systems and transmission pipelines.
		
		
			While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In January 2015, President Obama announced a series of administration actions to reduce methane emissions, including rulemaking by the EPA and the BLM as well as updating of standards by the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration. The current administration intends to promulgate proposed climate change rulemaking this summer aimed at reducing GHG emissions by 45% by 2025 compared to 2012 levels.  On January 22, 2016, the Department of the Interior announced its proposed emissions mandate on oil and natural gas producers who

operate on federal and Indian lands. While we expect new legislation and regulations to increase the cost of business, at this time it is not possible to quantify the impact on our business.  Any such future laws and final regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to develop and implement best management practices aimed at reducing GHG emissions, install and maintain emissions control technologies, as well as monitor and report on GHG emissions associated with our operations, which would increase our operating costs, and such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.  
		
		
			Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater produced in connection with our oil and gas production, which could limit our ability to produce oil and gas economically and have a material adverse effect on our business.
		
		
			We dispose of large volumes of saltwater produced in connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us or third party operators of disposal wells by governmental authorities overseeing produced water disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities.
		
		
			There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Oklahoma and Texas, where we operate. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are pursuing initiatives designed to impose additional requirements in the permitting of saltwater disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in 2014, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas, or Areas of Interest, in the Arbuckle formation, requiring operators to monitor and record well pressure and discharge volume on a daily basis and further requiring operators of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 barrels per day or more of saltwater to conduct mechanical integrity testing. Throughout 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division, or OGCD, issued a series of directives, expanding the areas of interest for induced seismicity and enhanced disposal restrictions and limiting the depths at which produced water could be injected or, in the alternative, reducing disposal volumes. Additional regulations and restrictions have been proposed in Oklahoma in 2016.  
		
		
			In addition, in 2014 the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, published a new rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells in Texas that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If a permittee or a prospective permittee fails to demonstrate that the saltwater or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well.
		
		
			The adoption and implementation of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of produced water, by changing the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us or third parties who dispose of our saltwater to shut down disposal wells, could increase disposal costs or require us to shut in a substantial number of our oil and natural gas wells or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce oil and gas economically and, accordingly, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
		
		
			We use some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risk and uncertainty in their application.
		
		
			Our horizontal drilling operations utilize some of the latest drilling and completion techniques. The risks or such techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;

				 ·
			
		
			
			staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			running casing the entire length of the wellbore; 
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;  
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and  
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.
		
			Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
		
		
			We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security and our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected by such security threats and disruptions.
		
		
			As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, pipelines and refineries; and threats from terrorist acts. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  While we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. 
		
		
			We rely heavily on our information systems, and the availability and integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our business and operations.  In addition to cybersecurity and data security threats, other information system failures and network disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunction or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar acts or occurrences. Such system failures could result in the unanticipated disruption of our operations, communications or processing of transactions, as well as loss of, or damage to, sensitive information, facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, the failure to meet regulatory standards and the reporting of our financial results, and other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
		
		
			While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure, our implementation of such procedures and controls may result in increased costs, and there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not occur and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity or information technology infrastructure vulnerabilities.
		
		
			Our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs on non-operated properties could result in economic losses that are partially beyond our control.
		
		
			Other companies operate approximately 26% of our net production. Our success in properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control. These factors include timing and amount of capital expenditures, the operator's expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants in drilling wells, selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners

for these projects could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities.
		
		
			Our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate.
		
		
			Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for oil and gas, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, formations with abnormal pressures, casing collapses, uncontrollable flows of underground gas, blowouts, surface cratering, pipeline ruptures or cement failures. Other such risks include theft, vandalism, environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			injury or loss of life;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			damage to, loss of or destruction of, property, natural resources and equipment;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			pollution and other environmental damages;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			regulatory investigations, civil litigation and penalties;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			damage to our reputation;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			suspension of our operations; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			costs related to repair and remediation.
		
			In addition, our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease.
		
		
			We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. We do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operation.
		
		
			We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.
		
		
			At December 31, 2015, our long-term debt consisted of $750 million of 4.375% senior notes due in 2024 and $750 million of 5.875% senior notes due in 2022. In addition to interest expense and principal on our long-term debt, we have demands on our cash resources including, among others, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
		
		
			Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon future performance and our ability to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by economic and capital market conditions, results of operations and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations also may be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates, as borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates.
		
		
			We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations. Without sufficient cash flow, there may not be adequate future sources of capital to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			reducing or delaying capital expenditures;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			seeking additional debt financing or equity capital;
		 

		

			25

		

 

		

			Table of Contents

		


		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			selling assets; or
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			restructuring or refinancing debt.
		
			We may be unable to complete any such strategies on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
		
		
			The instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.
		
		
			The indenture governing our senior notes and our credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that may limit management's discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements limit Cimarex's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:  
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			create certain liens;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			enter into sale and leaseback transactions.
		
			In addition, our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a total debt to capitaliztion ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not more than 65%. Also, the indenture, under which we issued our senior unsecured notes, restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is at least 2.25. The additional indebtedness limitation does not prohibit us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
		
		
			If we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indenture governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our credit facility or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make available further funds.
		
		
			Our acquisition activities may not be successful, which may hinder our replacement of reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.
		
		
			The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
		
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			geological risks and recoverable reserves;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			future oil and gas prices and their appropriate market differentials;
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			operating costs; and
		
			
				 ·
			
		
			
			potential environmental risks and other liabilities.
		
			The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Furthermore, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the identified problems.
		
		
			We may lose leases if production is not established within the time periods specified in the leases.

Unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. If we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves. The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 3.7% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2015. At that date, we had leases representing 74,874 net acres expiring in 2016, 89,785 net acres expiring in 2017, and 53,981 net acres expiring in 2018. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.
		
		
			Our disposition activities may be subject to factors beyond our control, and in certain cases we may retain unforeseen liabilities for certain matters.
		
		
			We regularly sell non-core assets in order to increase capital resources available for other core assets and to create organizational and operational efficiencies. We also occasionally sell interests in core assets for the purpose of accelerating the development and increasing efficiencies in such core assets. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets, including the approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the assets with terms we deem acceptable.
		
		
			Sellers often retain certain liabilities or agree to indemnify buyers for certain matters related to the sold assets. The magnitude of any such retained liability or of the indemnification obligation is difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately could be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, the company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.
		
		
			Competition for experienced, technical personnel may negatively impact our operations.
		
		
			Our exploratory and development drilling success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel. The loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. As we continue to develop our asset base and the scope of our operations, our future profitability will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly individuals with a strong background in geology, geophysics, engineering and operations.
		
		
			We are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
		
		
			In the normal course of business, we have various lawsuits and related disputed claims, including but not limited to claims concerning title, royalty payments, environmental issues, personal injuries, and contractual issues. Although we currently believe the resolution of these lawsuits and claims, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, our assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact that are not in accord with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such proceedings. Therefore, there can be no assurance that outcomes of future legal proceedings would not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
		
		
			Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, as a result of future legislation.
		
		
			Various proposals have been made recommending the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Legislation is often introduced in Congress which would implement many of these proposals. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective.
		
		
			The passage of this legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or

postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
