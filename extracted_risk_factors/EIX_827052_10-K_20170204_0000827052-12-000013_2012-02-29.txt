. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to SCE—Regulatory Risks." In the area of transmission infrastructure, SCE may experience increased competition from merchant transmission providers. The FERC has made changes to its transmission planning requirements with the goal of opening transmission development to competition from independent developers. In July 2011, the FERC adopted new rules that remove incumbent public utility transmission owners' federally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities. The rules direct regional entities, such as ISOs, to create new processes that would allow other providers to develop new transmission projects. The new processes will not become effective until approved by the FERC, which is expected in late 2012. The majority of SCE's 2012 – 2014 transmission capital forecast relates to transmission projects that have been approved by the CAISO and barring a re-evaluation under the new rules, will not be subject to the new processes. SCE does not expect these projects to be re-evaluated. The impact of the new rules on future transmission projects will depend on the processes ultimately implemented by regional entities.PropertiesSCE supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks. Its transmission facilities, which are located primarily in California but also in Nevada and Arizona, deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of lines ranging from 33 kV to 500 kV and substations. SCE's distribution system, which takes power from substations to customers, includes over 59,000 circuit miles of overhead lines, 44,000 circuit miles of underground lines and over 700 distribution substations, all of which are located in California.8Table of ContentsSCE owns the generating facilities listed in the following table.Generating Facility Location(in CA, unlessotherwise noted) Fuel Type Operator SCE'sOwnershipInterest (%) Net PhysicalCapacity(in MW) SCE's Capacitypro rata share(in MW)San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station South of San Clemente Nuclear SCE 78.21% 2,150 1,760Hydroelectric Plants (36) Various Hydroelectric SCE 100% 1,176 1,176Pebbly Beach GeneratingStation Catalina Island Diesel SCE 100% 9 9Mountainview Redlands Natural Gas SCE 100% 1,050 1,050Peaker Plants (4) Various Gas fueled Combustion Turbine SCE 100% 196 196Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Phoenix, AZ Nuclear APS 15.8% 3,739 591Four Corners Units 4 and 5 Farmington, NM Coal-fired APS 48%1 1,540 739Solar PV Plants (23) Various Photovoltaic SCE 100% 53 53Total         9,913 5,5741 In November 2010, SCE entered into an agreement to sell its interest in Four Corners to APS for approximately $294 million. The sale is contingent upon the satisfaction of several conditions and the obtaining of multiple regulatory approvals. Currently SCE estimates that the sale will close in the second half of 2012. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for more information.San Onofre, Four Corners, certain of SCE's substations, and portions of its transmission, distribution and communication systems are located on lands owned by the United States or others under licenses, permits, easements or leases, or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises. Certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate SCE, under specified circumstances and at its expense, to relocate such transmission, distribution, and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal, state, or local governments.Twenty-eight of SCE's 36 hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs are located in whole or in part on U.S.-owned lands pursuant to 30- to 50-year FERC licenses that expire at various times between 2012 and 2046. Such licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on SCE, including the right of the United States to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation. When existing licenses expire, the FERC has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications, but only if their license application is superior to SCE's and then only upon payment of specified compensation to SCE. New licenses issued to SCE are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the FERC to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process.Substantially all of SCE's properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements."SeasonalityDue to warm weather during the summer months and SCE's rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than the other quarters.9Table of ContentsEDISON MISSION GROUP INC.OverviewEMG's competitive power generation business primarily consists of the generation and sale into the PJM market of energy and capacity from merchant coal-fired power plants and a portfolio of natural gas and wind projects. EMG's operating results were significantly lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower realized energy and capacity prices and generation at the coal plants.At December 31, 2011, EME had corporate cash and cash equivalents of $951 million and $498 million of available borrowing capacity under its $564 million revolving credit facility maturing in June 2012 and Midwest Generation had cash and cash equivalents of $213 million and $497 million of available borrowing capacity under its $500 million credit facility maturing in June 2012. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, EME terminated its revolving credit facility and there can be no assurance that Midwest Generation will be eligible to draw on its credit facility prior to maturity. Any replacements of these credit lines will likely be on less favorable terms and conditions, and there is no assurance that EME will, or will be able to, replace these credit lines or any portion of them. EME had $3.7 billion of unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2011, $500 million of which mature in 2013. Unless energy and capacity prices increase, EME expects that it will experience further reductions in cash flow and losses in 2012 and subsequent years. EME's liquidity will be strained by a continuation of recent adverse trends, combined with pending debt maturities, higher operating costs and the need to retrofit its coal-fired plants to comply with governmental regulations. To address such a scenario, EME would need to consider all options available to it, including potential sales of assets or restructurings or reorganization of the capital structure of EME and its subsidiaries. Homer City failed to obtain sufficient interest from market participants to fund the capital improvements during the process undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2011. Homer City is currently engaged in discussions with the owner-lessors regarding the potential for such funding. EME expects that the outcome of any such discussions, if successful in providing funding for the Homer City plant, will likely result in EME's loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the Homer City plant. Failure to resolve the source of funding of necessary capital expenditures for the Homer City plant could result in Homer City's default under the lease agreements giving rise to remedies for the owner-lessors and secured lease obligation bondholders, which could include foreclosing on the leased assets, the general partner of Homer City, or both. For further discussion of these matters, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG" in the MD&A.RegulationFederal Power ActThe FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electricity and transmission services in interstate commerce (other than transmission that is "bundled" with retail sales), including ongoing, as well as initial, rate jurisdiction. The FERC also has jurisdiction over the sale or transfer of specified assets, including wholesale power sales contracts and generation facilities and, in some cases, jurisdiction over the issuance of securities or the assumption of specified liabilities. Dispositions of EMG's jurisdictional assets and certain types of financing arrangements may require FERC approval.Each of EMG's domestic generating facilities is either a qualifying facility, as determined by the FERC, or the subsidiary owning the facility is an exempt wholesale generator. Most qualifying facilities, including EMG's qualifying facilities, are exempt from the ratemaking and several other provisions of the Federal Power Act. EMG's exempt wholesale generators are subject to the FERC's ratemaking jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act, but have been authorized by the FERC to sell power at market-based rates. In addition, EMG's power marketing subsidiaries, including EMMT, have been authorized by the FERC to make wholesale market sales of power at market-based rates and are subject to FERC ratemaking regulation under the Federal Power Act.If one of the projects in which EMG has an interest were to lose its qualifying facility or exempt wholesale generator status, the project would no longer be entitled to the related exemptions from regulation and could become subject to rate regulation by the FERC and state authorities. Loss of status could also trigger defaults under covenants contained in the project's power sales agreements and financing agreements.Transmission of Wholesale PowerEMG's projects that sell power to wholesale purchasers other than the local utility to which the project may be interconnected require the transmission of electricity over power lines owned by others. The prices and other terms and conditions of 10Table of Contentstransmission contracts are regulated by the FERC when the entity providing the transmission service is subject to FERC jurisdiction.Markets for GenerationThe United States electric industry, including companies engaged in providing generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales and service of electric power, has undergone significant deregulation over the last three decades, which has led to increased competition, especially in the generation sector. In areas where ISOs and RTOs have been formed, market participants have open access to transmission service typically at a system-wide rate. ISOs and RTOs may also operate real-time and day-ahead energy and ancillary service markets, which are governed by FERC-approved tariffs and market rules. The development of such organized markets into which independent power producers are able to sell has reduced their dependence on bilateral contracts with electric utilities. In addition, capacity markets in various regional wholesale power markets compensate supply resources for the capability to supply electricity when needed, and demand resources, for electricity they avoid using.Wholesale MarketsEMG's largest power plants are its coal power plants located in Illinois, which are collectively referred to as the Midwest Generation plants, and the Homer City plant located in Pennsylvania. Collectively, both the Midwest Generation plants and the Homer City plant are referred to as the coal plants in this annual report. The coal plants sell power primarily into PJM, an RTO which includes all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Sales may also be made from PJM into the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator ("MISO") RTO, which includes all or parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and other states in the region, and into the NYISO, which controls the transmission grid and energy and capacity markets for New York State.PJM operates a wholesale spot energy market and determines the market-clearing price for each hour based on bids submitted by participating generators indicating the minimum prices at which a bidder is willing to dispatch energy at various incremental generation levels. PJM requires all load-serving entities and generators, such as Midwest Generation and Homer City, to maintain prescribed levels of capacity, including a reserve margin, to ensure system reliability. PJM's capacity markets have a single market-clearing price for each capacity zone. In May of each year, PJM conducts an annual capacity auction ("RPM") to commit generation, energy efficiency and demand side resources three years forward, and to provide a long-term pricing signal for the construction of capacity resources.Fuel SupplyThe Midwest Generation plants purchase coal from several suppliers located in the Southern PRB of Wyoming. The total volume of coal consumed annually is largely dependent on the amount of generation and has historically ranged between 17 million to 19 million tons. Coal consumption in the current low natural gas price environment may be lower than the historical range. Coal is transported under transportation agreements with Union Pacific Railroad and various short-line carriers. In late 2011, Midwest Generation signed new agreements, effective January 1, 2012, to provide fuel transportation on a long-term basis. For additional information, see "EMG: Results of Operations—Market Risk Exposures—Commodity Price Risk—Coal and Transportation Risk" in the MD&A. As of December 31, 2011, Midwest Generation leased approximately 3,400 railcars to transport the coal from the mines to the generating stations, under leases with remaining terms that range from less than one year to eight years, with options to extend the leases or purchase some railcars at the end of the lease terms.Homer City's Units 1 and 2 have historically consumed approximately 2.8 million to 3.3 million tons of mid-range sulfur coal per year. Two types of coal are purchased, ready-to-burn and raw coal. Ready-to-burn coal is of the quality that can be burned directly in Units 1 and 2, whereas the raw coal purchased for consumption by Units 1 and 2 must be cleaned in the Homer City coal cleaning facility, which has the capacity to clean up to 5 million tons of coal per year. Unit 3 has historically consumed approximately 1.5 million to 2 million tons of coal per year and can consume either raw or ready-to-burn coal. Coal consumption in the current low natural gas price environment may be lower than the historical range. A wet scrubber FGD system for Unit 3 enables this unit to burn less expensive, higher sulfur coal, while still meeting environmental standards for emission control. In general, the coal purchased for all three units is acquired locally.  For additional information, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG" and "EMG: Results of Operations—Market Risk Exposures—Commodity Price Risk—Coal and Transportation Risk" in the MD&A.11Table of ContentsCompetitionEMG is subject to competition from energy marketers, public utilities, government-owned power agencies, industrial companies, financial institutions, and other independent power producers. These companies may have competitive advantages as a result of scale, the location of their generation facilities, or other factors. Some of EMG's competitors have a lower cost of capital than EMG and, in the case of utilities, may be able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms, allowing them to build, buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments.State and local environmental regulations, particularly those that impose stringent state-specific emission limits in Illinois, could put EMG's coal plants at a disadvantage compared with competing power plants operating in nearby states and subject to less stringent state emission limits or to federal emission limits alone. The CPS puts the Midwest Generation plants at a disadvantage compared with competing plants not subject to similar regulations, and federal air quality regulations such as CSAPR and the MATS rule will put EMG's coal plants, particularly Homer City, at a disadvantage compared to plants utilizing other fuels. Potential future climate change regulations could also put EME's coal plants at a disadvantage compared to power plants utilizing other fuels as well as utilities that can also be able to recover climate change compliance costs through rate base mechanisms. The ability of EMG's coal plants to compete may be affected by future environmental regulations, by governmental and regulatory activities designed to support the construction and operation of power generation facilities fueled by renewable energy sources, and by developments such as shale gas technology that lower the price of other fuels.12Table of ContentsPropertiesPower Plants in OperationAs of December 31, 2011, EMG's operations consisted of ownership or leasehold interests in the following operating projectsPower Plants Location PrimaryElectricPurchaser2 Fuel Type EMG'sOwnershipInterest NetPhysicalCapacity(in MW) EMG's Capacity Pro Rata Share(in MW)MERCHANT POWER PLANTSMidwest Generation plants1 Illinois  PJM coal 100% 5,172 5,172Midwest Generation plants1 Illinois  PJM oil 100% 305 305Homer City plant1 Pennsylvania PJM coal 100% 1,884 1,884Merchant Wind            Goat Wind Texas ERCOT wind 99.9%3 150 150Lookout Pennsylvania PJM wind 100% 38 38Big Sky Illinois PJM wind 100% 240 240CONTRACTED POWER PLANTS – DomesticNatural Gas            Big 4 Projects            Kern River1 California SCE natural gas 50% 300 150Midway-Sunset1 California PG&E natural gas 50% 225 113Sycamore1 California SCE natural gas 50% 300 150Watson California SCE natural gas 49% 385 189Westside Projects (4)1 California PG&E natural gas 50% 152 76Sunrise1 California CDWR natural gas 50% 572 286Renewable Energy            Buffalo Bear Oklahoma WFEC wind 100% 19 19Cedro Hill Texas CSA wind 100% 150 150Community Wind North Minnesota NSPC wind 99% 30 30Crosswinds Iowa CBPC wind 99%3 21 21Elkhorn Ridge Nebraska NPPD wind 67% 80 53Forward Pennsylvania CECG wind 100% 29 29Hardin Iowa IPLC wind 99%3 15 15High Lonesome New Mexico APSC wind 100% 100 100Jeffers Minnesota NSPC wind 99.9%3 50 50Laredo Ridge Nebraska NPPD wind 100% 80 80Minnesota Wind projects4 Minnesota NSPC/IPLC wind 75-99%3 73 67Mountain Wind I Wyoming PC wind 100% 61 61Mountain Wind II Wyoming PC wind 100% 80 80Odin Minnesota MRES wind 99.9%3 20 20Pinnacle5 West Virginia MDGS/USM wind 100% 55 55San Juan Mesa New Mexico SPS wind 75% 120 90Sleeping Bear Oklahoma PSCO wind 100% 95 95Spanish Fork Utah PC wind 100% 19 19Storm Lake1 Iowa MEC wind 100% 108 108Taloga Oklahoma OGEC wind 100% 130 130Wildorado Texas SPS wind 99.9%3 161 161Huntington Waste-to-Energy New York LIPA biomass 38% 25 9Coal            American Bituminous1 West Virginia MPC waste coal 50% 80 40CONTRACTED POWER PLANTS – InternationalDoga Republic of Turkey TEDAS natural gas 80% 180 144Total         11,504 10,3791 Plant is operated under contract by an EME operations and maintenance subsidiary or the plant is operated or managed directly by an EME subsidiary.13Table of Contents2 Electric purchaser abbreviations are as follows:APSC Arizona Public Service Company NPPD Nebraska Public Power DistrictCBPC Corn Belt Power Cooperative NSPC Northern States Power CompanyCDWR California Department of Water Resources OGEC Oklahoma Gas and Electric CompanyCECG Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc.

Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."Asset Management and Trading ActivitiesEMG's power marketing and trading subsidiary, EMMT, manages the energy and capacity of EMG's merchant generating plants and, in addition, trades electric power, gas, oil and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps. EMMT segregates its activities into two categories:•Asset Management–EMMT engages in the sale of energy and capacity and the purchase and sale of fuels, including  natural gas and fuel oil, through intercompany contracts with EMG's subsidiaries that own or lease EMG's facilities. EMG uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from price fluctuations of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. The objective of these activities is to sell the output of EMG's facilities on a forward basis or to hedge the risk of future changes in prices or price differences between different locations. Hedging activities include on-peak and off-peak periods and may include load service requirements contracts with local utilities. Transactions related to hedging activities are designated separately from EMMT's trading activities. Not all contracts entered into by EMMT for hedging purposes qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.•Trading–EMMT seeks to generate trading profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels, and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under limitations approved by EMG's risk management committee.14Table of ContentsEnergy and Infrastructure InvestmentsEMG's energy and infrastructure investments include leveraged leases and affordable housing projects in the United States. As of December 31, 2011, Edison Capital was the lessor with an investment balance (including current lease receivable) of $117 million in the following leveraged leases:Transaction Asset Location Basic LeaseTerm Ends InvestmentBalance(In millions) Vidalia: selling power to Entergy Louisiana, City of Vidalia 192 MWhydro power plant Vidalia, Louisiana 2020 $69 Beaver Valley: selling power to Ohio Edison Company, Centerior Energy Corporation 836 MWnuclear power plant  Shippingport, Pennsylvania 2017 $46 American Airlines 3 Boeing 767 ERaircraft Domestic and international routes 2016 $81 1 American Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in November 2011. As a result, Edison Capital recorded a pre-tax $26 million charge related it its net investments in aircraft leases.   SeasonalityDue to fluctuations in electric demand resulting from warm weather during the summer months and cold weather during the winter months, electric revenues from the coal plants normally vary substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, maintenance outages generally are scheduled during periods of lower projected electric demand (spring and fall), further reducing generation and increasing major maintenance costs which are recorded as an expense when incurred. Accordingly, income from the coal plants is seasonal and has significant variability from quarter to quarter. Seasonal fluctuations may also be affected by changes in market prices. For further discussion regarding market prices, see "EMG: Market Risk Exposures—Commodity Price Risk—Energy Price Risk" in the MD&A.EMG's third quarter equity in income from its unconsolidated energy projects is normally higher than equity in income related to other quarters of the year due to seasonal fluctuations and higher energy contract prices during the summer months.15Table of ContentsENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION OF EDISON INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIESLegislative and regulatory activities by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States relating to energy and the environment impose numerous restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities by Edison International's subsidiaries, as well as the cost of mitigating the environmental impacts of past operations. Many of these laws, regulations and other activities affect both SCE and EMG's facilities, although not always to the same extent. The environmental regulations and other developments discussed below have the largest impact on fossil-fuel fired power plants, and therefore the discussion in this section focuses on regulations applicable to the states of California, New Mexico, Illinois and Pennsylvania, where such facilities are located.Edison International continues to monitor legislative and regulatory developments and to evaluate possible strategies for compliance with environmental regulations. Additional information about environmental matters affecting Edison International, including projected environmental capital expenditures, is included in the MD&A under the heading "SCE: Liquidity—Capital Investment Plan," "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies" and "—Note 10. Environmental Developments, and "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" in the MD&A.Air QualityThe CAA, which regulates air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources, has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel plants, especially coal-fired plants. The CAA requires the US EPA to establish concentration levels in the ambient air for six criteria pollutants to protect public health and welfare. These concentration levels are known as National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS. The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2.Federal environmental regulations of these criteria pollutants require states to adopt state implementation plans, known as SIPs, for certain pollutants, which detail how the state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation. The SIPs must be equal to or more stringent than the federal requirements and must be submitted to the US EPA for approval. Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas), and must develop a SIP both to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas. If the attainment status of areas changes, states may be required to develop new SIPs that address the changes. Many of EMG's facilities are located in areas that have not attained NAAQS for ozone (affected by NOx emissions from power plants) and fine particulate matter (affected by SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants) and much of Southern California is in a non-attainment area for several criteria pollutants.As described further below, on December 11, 2006, Midwest Generation entered into an agreement with the Illinois EPA, which was subsequently embodied in an Illinois rule called the Combined Pollutant Standard or "CPS," to reduce mercury, NOx and SO2 emissions at the Midwest Generation plants. The CPS requires Midwest Generation to achieve air emission reductions for NOx and SO2, and those reductions should contribute to or effect compliance with various existing US EPA ambient air quality standards. It is possible that if lower ozone, particulate matter, NOx or SO2 NAAQS are finalized by US EPA in the future, Illinois may implement regulations that are more stringent than those required by the CPS.Nitrogen Oxide and Sulfur DioxideClean Air Interstate and Cross-State Air Pollution RulesThe CAIR, issued by the US EPA on March 10, 2005, mandated significant reductions in NOx and SO2 emission allowance caps under the CAA in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit initially vacated the CAIR, but later remanded the CAIR to the US EPA for the issuance of a revised rule. The CAIR remains in effect until a replacement regulation becomes effective.On July 6, 2011, the US EPA adopted the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"). CSAPR establishes emissions reductions for annual SO2 emissions and annual and ozone season NOx emissions in two phases: a first phase originally scheduled to be effective January 1, 2012 and, in most states subject to the program (including Illinois and Pennsylvania), a second phase effective January 1, 2014 that requires additional reductions in annual SO2 emissions.In December 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a stay of CSAPR pending completion of its review of the rule's validity. Oral argument is scheduled for April 13, 2012, and a court decision is expected during the third quarter of 2012. The court directed the US EPA to continue administering the CAIR until its review is completed.16Table of ContentsCSAPR, like the CAIR, is an allowance-based regulation that provides for emissions trading. If the stay is lifted and CSAPR becomes effective, the amount of actual SO2 or NOx emissions from plant operations will need to be matched by a sufficient amount of SO2 or NOx allowances that are either allocated or purchased in the open market. In connection with CSAPR, the US EPA has, for each phase, established SO2 and NOx allowance allocations for each state and each generating unit subject to the regulation, and at the close of the annual or seasonal compliance period, units will need to surrender allowances for each ton of SO2 and NOx emitted or face penalties. With the staying of CSAPR, CAIR SO2 allowances have been provided and a sufficient supply is available for purchase to permit Homer City to continue operations consistent with 2011 levels. If the stay is lifted, the SO2 allowances allocated to Homer City in CSAPR Phase I (25,797 tons in 2012 and 2013) would be significantly lower than the amount that would be required based on Homer City's historical emissions. It is unclear at this time whether Homer City would be able to acquire allowances in sufficient quantity to cover its normal operations during Phase I of CSAPR and whether it would be able to pass through the cost of such allowances in the marketplace. Accordingly, despite the stay, Homer City continues to evaluate alternative options, including reduced dispatch and fuel modifications, for complying with Phase I of CSAPR. The cost of allowances, together with possible operational impacts or reductions of output that may be required to comply with Phase I of CSAPR, could have a material effect on Homer City.Homer City has begun work on designing SO2 and particulate emissions control equipment for Units 1 and 2. Based on preliminary estimates, Homer City expects the cost of such equipment to be approximately $700 million to $750 million. However, construction of these improvements is dependent upon funding from the owner-lessors or other third parties. For additional information, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease."Revised NAAQS for Sulfur DioxideIn June 2010, the US EPA finalized the primary NAAQS for SO2 by establishing a new one-hour standard at a level of 75 parts per billion. In June 2011, Pennsylvania and Illinois submitted their initial recommended attainment/nonattainment designations in connection with the standard. Pennsylvania recommended designating Indiana County, where the Homer City plant is located, as nonattainment for the SO2 NAAQS. Illinois recommended designating parts of Tazewell County (where the Powerton plant is located) and Will and Cook Counties as nonattainment with this standard. The recommended designation for parts of Will and Cook Counties included the area where the Will County plant is located, but not the areas where Midwest Generation's other plants in those counties are located.IllinoisOn December 11, 2006, Midwest Generation entered into an agreement with the Illinois EPA to reduce mercury, NOx and SO2 emissions at the Midwest Generation plants. The agreement has been embodied in the CPS. All of Midwest Generation's Illinois coal-fired electric generating units are subject to the CPS. The CPS also specifies the control technologies that are to be installed on some units by specified dates. Midwest Generation must either install the required technology by the specified deadline or shut down the unit. The principal emission standards and control technology requirements for NOx and SO2 under the CPS are as described below:NOx Emissions–Beginning in calendar year 2012 and continuing in each calendar year thereafter, Midwest Generation must comply with an annual and seasonal NOx emission rate of no more than 0.11 lbs/million Btu. Midwest Generation substantially completed installation of SNCR equipment in 2011 for compliance with the emission limitations. Capital expenditures relating to these controls were $105 million.SO2 Emissions–Midwest Generation must comply with an overall SO2 annual emission rate beginning with 0.44 lbs/million Btu in 2013 and decreasing annually until it reaches 0.11 lbs/million Btu in 2019 and thereafter.Testing of dry scrubbing using Trona on select Midwest Generation units has demonstrated significant reductions in SO2 emissions. Use of dry sorbent injection technology in conjunction with low sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and time to construct than the use of spray dryer absorber technology, but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and competitiveness of Midwest Generation's plants, depending on competitors' costs. For further discussion, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Midwest Generation and Compliance Plans and Cost" in the MD&A.PennsylvaniaThe Homer City plant was subject to the federal CAIR during 2011 and complied with both the NOx and SO2 requirements by using existing equipment and purchasing SO2 allowances. Pennsylvania adopted a state version of the CAIR, which the US EPA approved in December 2009. Homer City expects to comply with the Pennsylvania CAIR, which is substantially 17Table of Contentssimilar to the federal CAIR as it existed prior to the implementation of CSAPR, in the same manner in which it complies with the federal standards.Mercury/Hazardous Air PollutantsMercury and Air Toxics Standards RuleIn December 2011, the US EPA announced the Mercury and Toxics Air Standards ("MATS") rule, limiting emissions of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electrical generating units. The rule was published in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012, and becomes effective on April 16, 2012. EMG does not expect that these standards will require Midwest Generation to make material changes to the approach to compliance with state and federal environmental regulations that it contemplates for CPS compliance. EMG also does not expect that these standards will require Homer City to make additional capital expenditures beyond those that would be required for compliance with CSAPR Phase II.IllinoisThe CPS requires that, beginning in calendar year 2015, and continuing thereafter on a rolling 12-month basis, Midwest Generation must either achieve an emission standard of .008 lbs mercury/GWh gross electrical output or a minimum 90% reduction in mercury for each unit (except Unit 3 at the Will County Station, which will be included in calendar year 2016). Midwest Generation will be required to install cold side electrostatic precipitator or baghouse equipment on Unit 7 at the Waukegan Station by December 31, 2013, and on Unit 3 at the Will County Station by December 31, 2015.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania currently has no state level mercury regulations.OzoneNational Ambient Air Quality StandardsIn January 2010, the US EPA proposed a revision to the primary and secondary NAAQS for 8-hour ozone that it had finalized in 2008. The 8-hour ozone standard established in 2008 was 0.075 parts per million. In January 2010, the US EPA proposed establishing a primary 8-hour ozone NAAQS between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million and a distinct secondary standard to protect sensitive vegetation and ecosystems. In September 2011, President Obama announced that the proposed revision was being withdrawn. The ozone NAAQS established in 2008 remains in place, but the implementation process must be completed before the 0.075 parts-per-million standard can be enforced. The US EPA has indicated that it intends to issue initial area designations of attainment, nonattainment, and unclassifiable areas across the nation in 2012. States will then be required to develop and submit SIPs outlining how compliance with the 2008 NAAQS will be achieved. New primary and secondary ozone standards are expected in 2014.In January 2012, the US EPA indicated that it intended to designate the counties in Illinois where Midwest Generation's coal-fired power plants are located as nonattainment with the 2008 NAAQS. In December 2011, the US EPA indicated that it intended to designate Indiana County, where the Homer City plant is located, as in attainment with the 2008 NAAQS.Regional HazeThe regional haze rules under the CAA are designed to prevent impairment of visibility in certain federally designated areas. The goal of the rules is to restore visibility in mandatory federal Class I areas, such as national parks and wilderness areas, to natural background conditions by 2064. Sources such as power plants that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in Class I areas may be required to install best available retrofit technology ("BART") or implement other control strategies to meet regional haze control requirements. In relation to Four Corners, the US EPA issued its proposed FIP in October 2010. The proposed FIP would require the installation of SCR pollution control equipment within designated time periods. In November 2010, SCE and APS entered into an agreement for the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5 to APS, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions. Due to the investment constraints of SB 1368, the California law on GHG emission performance standards discussed below in "—Greenhouse Gas Regulation—Regional Initiatives and State Legislation," SCE does not expect to be a Four Corners participant after the 2016 expiration of the current participant agreements and does not expect to participate in any investment in Four Corners SCRs. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for more information on the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners.18Table of ContentsIllinois and PennsylvaniaBoth Pennsylvania and Illinois have submitted their proposed SIP revisions to the US EPA to address regional haze. Illinois proposed that the emission reductions that the Midwest Generation plants will be required to make pursuant to the CPS, discussed above in "—Nitrogen Oxide and Sulfur Dioxide—Illinois," satisfy the BART requirement. Pennsylvania proposed that the existing particulate matter emission limits on the Homer City plant, as well as the plant's participation in the CAIR, would satisfy the BART requirement in that state. Because the CAIR was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2011, the US EPA proposed, on December 30, 2011, a limited disapproval of Pennsylvania's SIP, as well as a Federal Implementation Plan that would allow the Homer City plant's participation in CSAPR to satisfy the BART requirement. It is unclear how the stay of CSAPR will affect the Pennsylvania SIP. EME believes that the control measures being undertaken to comply with other environmental regulations will likely satisfy the requirements of these SIPs.New Source Review RequirementsThe NSR regulations impose certain requirements on facilities, such as electric generating stations, if modifications are made to air emissions sources at the facility. Since 1999, the US EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's coal-fired power plants. The US EPA has filed enforcement actions against Homer City and Midwest Generation alleging NSR violations. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."New MexicoIn April 2009, APS, as operating agent of Four Corners, received a US EPA request pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA for information about Four Corners, including information about Four Corners' capital projects from 1990 to the present. SCE understands that in other cases the US EPA has utilized responses to similar Section 114 letters to examine whether power plants have triggered NSR requirements under the CAA. In October 2011, four environmental organizations filed a lawsuit against the Four Corners owners alleging NSR violations. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," for information on the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners.Water QualityClean Water ActRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act govern critical operating parameters at generating facilities, such as the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. In March 2011, the US EPA proposed standards under the federal Clean Water Act that would affect cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. The standards are intended to protect aquatic organisms by reducing capture in screens attached to cooling water intake structures (impingement) and in the water volume brought into the facilities (entrainment). The regulations are expected to be finalized by July 2012.  The required measures to comply with the proposed standards regarding entrainment are subject to the discretion of the permitting authority, and Edison International is unable at this time to assess potential costs of compliance, which could be significant for the Midwest Generation plants and San Onofre, but are not expected to be material for the Homer City plant, which already has cooling towers.California—Prohibition on the Use of Ocean-Based Once-Through CoolingCalifornia has a US EPA-approved program to issue individual or group permits for the regulation of Clean Water Act discharges. California also regulates certain discharges not regulated by the US EPA. Effective October 1, 2010, the California State Water Resources Control Board issued a final policy, which establishes closed-cycle wet cooling as required technology for retrofitting existing once-through cooled plants like SCE's San Onofre and many of the existing fossil-fueled power plants along the California coast. The final policy required an independent engineering study to be completed prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 regarding the feasibility of compliance by California's two coastal nuclear power plants. The policy may result in significant capital expenditures at San Onofre and may affect its operations. IllinoisMidwest Generation is a party to an administrative proceeding before the Illinois Pollution Control Board to determine whether more stringent thermal and effluent water quality standards for the Chicago Area Waterway System and Lower Des Plaines River, which supply cooling water to Midwest Generation's Will County and Joliet Stations, will be implemented. The rule, if implemented, is expected to affect the manner in which those stations use water for station cooling. It is not possible to predict the timing for resolution of the proceeding, the final form of the rule, or how it would impact the operation of the affected stations; however, significant capital expenditures may be required.19Table of ContentsCoal Combustion WastesUS EPA regulations currently classify coal ash and other coal combustion residuals as solid wastes that are exempt from hazardous waste requirements. This classification enables beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals, such as for cement production and fill materials. Midwest Generation currently provides a portion of its coal combustion residuals for beneficial uses. In June 2010, the US EPA published proposed regulations relating to coal combustion residuals that could result in their reclassification. For further discussion see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—    Note 10. Environmental Developments."Greenhouse Gas RegulationThere have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Any climate change regulation or other legal obligation that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions or that would impose additional costs or charges for the emission of GHGs could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels, and especially from coal-fired plants, as well as the cost of purchased power, which could adversely affect Edison International.Federal Legislative/Regulatory DevelopmentsIn June 2010, the US EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, known as the "GHG tailoring rule." This regulation generally subjects newly constructed sources of GHG emissions and newly modified existing major sources to the PSD air permitting program beginning in January 2011 (and later, to the Title V permitting program under the CAA); however the GHG tailoring rule significantly increases the emissions thresholds that apply before facilities are subjected to these programs. The emissions thresholds for CO2 equivalents in the final rule vary from 75,000 tons per year to 100,000 tons per year depending on the date and whether the sources are new or modified.Regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the PSD program could affect efforts to modify EMG's or SCE's facilities in the future, and could subject new capital projects to additional permitting or emissions control requirements that could delay such projects. In December 2010, the US EPA announced that it had entered into a settlement with various states and environmental groups to resolve a long-standing dispute over regulation of GHGs from electrical generating units pursuant to the New Source Performance Standards in the CAA and would propose performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants and emissions guidelines for existing power plants. The specific requirements will not be known until the regulations are finalized. Since January 2010, the US EPA's Final Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule has required all sources within specified categories, including electric generation facilities, to monitor emissions and to submit annual reports to the US EPA by March 31 of each year. EMG's 2011 GHG emissions were approximately 43 million metric tons. SCE's 2011 GHG emissions were approximately 5.8 million metric tons. Regional Initiatives and State LegislationRegional initiatives and state legislation may also require reductions of GHG emissions and it is not yet clear whether or to what extent any federal legislation would preempt them. If state and/or regional initiatives remain in effect after federal legislation is enacted, utilities and generators could be required to satisfy them in addition to the federal standards.Edison International subsidiary operations in California are subject to two laws governing GHG emissions. The first law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (also referred to as AB 32), establishes a comprehensive program to reduce GHG emissions. AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") to develop regulations, effective in 2012, that would reduce California's GHG emissions to 1990 levels in yearly increments by 2020. In December 2011, the CARB regulation was officially published establishing a California cap-and-trade program. The first compliance period under the regulations is for 2013 GHG emissions. CARB regulations implementing a cap-and-trade program and the cap-and-trade program itself, continue to be the subject of litigation. In December 2011, a federal district court enjoined the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, another AB 32 program regulating the carbon content of transportation fuels, on constitutional commerce clause grounds. Additional litigation challenging the cap-and-trade program on similar grounds is expected, though no suit has been filed to date. The second law, SB 1368, required the CPUC and the CEC to adopt GHG emission performance standards restricting the ability of California investor-owned and publicly owned utilities, respectively, to enter into long-term arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The standards that have been adopted prohibit these entities, including SCE, from entering into long-term financial commitments with generators that emit more than 1,100 pounds of CO2 per MWh, the performance of a combined-cycle gas turbine generator. SB 1368 may prohibit SCE from making emission control expenditures at Four Corners. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for information on the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners.20Table of ContentsCalifornia law has also required SCE to increase its electricity generated from renewable resources by at least 1% of its annual retail electricity sales per year so that 20% of its annual electricity sales are provided from such resources (the "RPS Program") by no later than December 31, 2010 or such later date as flexible compliance requirements permit. In accordance with the procurement rules and regulations, SCE demonstrated full compliance with the RPS Program in its March 2011 and August 2011 filings. In April 2011, California enacted a law requiring California retail sellers of electricity to procure 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute. The impact of the new 33% law will depend on how the CPUC and CEC implement the law, which remains uncertain. On December 1, 2011, the CPUC approved a decision setting procurement quantity requirements for CPUC-regulated retail sellers that incrementally increase to 33% over several periods between January 2011 and December 31, 2020. The quantity would remain at 33% of retail sales for each year thereafter. Currently SCE estimates its delivery of eligible renewable resources to customers to be 21% of its total energy portfolio for 2011.Litigation DevelopmentsLitigation alleging that GHG is a public and private nuisance may affect Edison International and its subsidiaries, whether or not they are named as defendants. The law is unsettled on whether this litigation presents questions capable of judicial resolution or political questions that should be resolved by the legislative or executive branches. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments."ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONALEdison International's subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory decisions and changes in applicable regulations or legislation.SCE operates in a highly regulated environment. SCE's business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. The CPUC regulates SCE's retail operations, and the FERC regulates SCE's wholesale operations. The NRC regulates SCE's nuclear power plants. The construction, planning, and project site identification of SCE's power plants and transmission lines in California are also subject to the jurisdiction of the California Energy Commission (for plants 50 MW or greater), and the CPUC. SCE must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders. Should SCE be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on SCE, SCE's business could be adversely affected. The process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by concerted community opposition and such delay or defeat would have an adverse effect on SCE's business.EMG's projects are subject to federal laws and regulations that govern, among other things, transactions by and with purchasers of power, including utility companies, the development and construction of generation facilities, the ownership and operations of generation facilities, and access to transmission. Generation facilities are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the geographical location, zoning, land use and operation of a project. EMG in the course of its business must obtain and periodically renew licenses, permits and approvals for its facilities. The FERC may impose various forms of market mitigation measures, including price caps and operating restrictions, where it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires mitigation. Independent System Operators and Regional Transmission Operators may impose bidding and scheduling rules, both to curb the potential exercise of market power and to facilitate market functions. EMG is required to surrender emission allowances equal to emissions of specific substances in connection with the operation of its facilities. This may require the purchase of allowances, which are subject to price volatility and which could be unavailable.This extensive governmental regulation creates significant risks and uncertainties for Edison International's business. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to SCE, EMG or their facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on Edison International's business or result in significant additional costs. In addition, regulation adopted via the public initiative process may apply to SCE or EMG, or its facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on Edison International's business or result in significant additional costs.21Table of ContentsEdison International's subsidiaries are subject to extensive environmental regulations that may involve significant and increasing costs and adversely affect them.Edison International's subsidiaries are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations and permitting requirements that involve significant and increasing costs and substantial uncertainty. SCE and EMG devote significant resources to environmental monitoring, emissions control equipment, mitigation projects, and emission allowances to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulatory requirements. However, the current trend is toward more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement greenhouse gas controls could adversely affect operations, particularly of the coal-fired plants. Other environmental laws, particularly with respect to air emissions, disposal of ash, wastewater discharge, and cooling water systems, are also generally becoming more stringent. The continued operation of SCE and EMG facilities, particularly the coal-fired facilities, is expected to require substantial capital expenditures for environmental controls or cessation of operations. Cessation of operations of such coal-fired plants at EMG would have a material adverse effect on EMG. SCE and EMG may also be exposed to risks arising from past, current or future contamination at its former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in its operations. Current and future state laws and regulations in California also could increase the required amount of power that must be procured from renewable resources. For further discussion of the environmental regulations applicable to Edison International and its subsidiaries, see "Item 1. Business—Environmental Regulation of Edison International and Subsidiaries" and "Item 8. SCE Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments."Edison International's liquidity depends on SCE's ability to pay dividends to Edison International and its subsidiaries' payment of tax-allocation payments that may become due to Edison International.Edison International is a holding company and, as such, it has no operations of its own. Edison International's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of SCE and its ability to make upstream distributions. Prior to paying dividends to Edison International, SCE has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. SCE and EMG may also owe tax-allocation payments to Edison International under applicable tax-allocation or payment agreements. Financial market and economic conditions may have an adverse effect on Edison International's subsidiaries. See "Risks Relating to SCE" and "Risks Relating to EMG" below for further discussion.The businesses of Edison International's subsidiaries may be adversely affected by technological developments.Technological advancements such as energy storage or self generation via solar panels may adversely affect the economics of SCE's business as a regulated utility. Other technological advancements in the area of power production that create or increase the supply of less expensive power, such as shale natural gas extraction technology, may adversely affect EMG's business as an independent merchant power producer. See "Risks Relating to SCE" and "Risks Relating to EMG" below for further discussion.The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of injury to employees and the general public.Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment. Injuries caused by such contact can subject SCE and EMG to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In the wake of recent natural disasters such as windstorms, which can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages, the CPUC has increased its focus on public safety issues with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. Such penalties and liabilities could be significant but are very difficult to predict. The range of possible penalties and liabilities includes amounts that could adversely affect SCE's and EMG's liquidity and results of operations.RISKS RELATING TO SCERegulatory RisksSCE's financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates.SCE's ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover from its customers in a timely manner its costs, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and FERC. SCE's financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. SCE's capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power, increasing environmental regulations, 22Table of Contentsmoderating demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. Increases in self generation also reduce the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered, while costs potentially increase due to system modifications that may be necessary to cope with the systemic effects of self-generation. Customers that self-generate their own power do not currently pay most transmission and distribution charges and are only subject to certain non-bypassable charges. The net result is to increase utility rates further for those customers who do not self-generate, which encourages more self generation and further rate increases. If SCE is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or to recover material amounts of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For further information on SCE's rate requests, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of SCE—2012 General Rate Case" and "—FERC Formula Rates" in the MD&A.SCE's energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity.SCE obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants, as well as through contracts with energy producers and sellers. California law and CPUC decisions allow SCE to recover through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. Nonetheless, SCE's cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes to commodity prices. In addition, SCE is subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely CPUC decisions about the compliance with SCE's procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs.SCE may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could adversely affect SCE's liquidity and results of operations. See "SCE: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Market Risk Exposures" in the MD&A.Operating RisksSCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in operating and improving its facilities.SCE's infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. In order to mitigate this risk, SCE is engaged in one of the largest infrastructure investment programs in its history, which involves multiple large-scale projects in multiple locations. This substantial increase in activity from SCE's historical levels elevates the operational risks and the need for superior execution in its activities. SCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in operating and improving its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous. SCE's inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs, system limitations and degradation, and interruptions in necessary supplies. For example, SCE has recently experienced significant additional costs and disruptions in the progress of its Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project. See "SCE: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Investment Plan" in the MD&A.SCE's systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.Regulators, such as the NERC, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, have noted that the U.S. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures have potential vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and disruptions and that such cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. SCE's operations require the continuous operation of critical information technology systems and network infrastructure. Although SCE actively monitors developments in this area and is involved in various industry groups and government initiatives, no security measures can completely shield such systems and infrastructure from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. If SCE's information technology systems security measures were to be breached or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, SCE could be unable to fulfill critical business functions and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could adversely affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations. See "Item 1. Business—Southern California Edison Company—Regulation—NERC" for further discussion.There are inherent risks associated with operating nuclear power generating facilities.Continued NRC scrutiny of San Onofre may result in additional corrective actions that will increase operations and maintenance costs or require additional capital expenditures.23Table of ContentsSan Onofre is subject to extensive oversight and scrutiny of the NRC. This scrutiny may result in SCE being required to take additional corrective actions and incur increased operations and maintenance expenses or new capital expenditures. If SCE is unable to take effective corrective actions required by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. See "Item 1. Business—Southern California Edison Company—Regulation—Nuclear Power Plant Regulation" for further discussion.Existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect SCE fully against losses from a nuclear incident.Federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection which is currently approximately $12.6 billion. SCE and other owners of the San Onofre and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $375 million per site. If nuclear incident liability claims were to exceed $375 million, the remaining amount would be made up from contributions of approximately $12.2 billion made by all of the nuclear facility owners in the U.S., up to an aggregate total of $12.6 billion. There is no assurance that the CPUC would allow SCE to recover the required contribution made in the case of one or more nuclear incident claims that exceeded $375 million. If this public liability limit of $12.6 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. There can be no assurance of SCE's ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Nuclear Insurance."Spent fuel storage capacity could be insufficient to permit long-term operation of SCE's nuclear plants.The U.S. Department of Energy has defaulted on its obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear industry participants by January 31, 1998. If SCE or the operator of Palo Verde were unable to arrange and maintain sufficient capacity for interim spent-fuel storage now or in the future, it could hinder the operation of the plants and impair the value of SCE's ownership interests until storage could be obtained, each of which may have a material adverse effect on SCE.SCE's insurance coverage for wildfires arising from its ordinary operations may not be sufficient and Edison International may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance on SCE's behalf for such occurrences.Edison International has been experiencing increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from SCE's ordinary operations. In addition, the insurance Edison International has obtained on SCE's behalf for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially and adversely affect Edison International's and SCE's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to Edison International. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments."Financing RisksAs a capital intensive company, SCE relies on access to the capital markets. If SCE were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations would be adversely affected.SCE regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. SCE's needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. SCE's ability to arrange financing as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest are dependent on numerous factors, including SCE's levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, its financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. SCE's failure to obtain additional capital from time to time would have a material adverse effect on SCE's liquidity and operations. See "SCE: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Investment Plan" and "—Historical Segment Cash Flows" in the MD&A.RISKS RELATING TO EMGLiquidity RisksEME and its subsidiaries have significant cash requirements, limited sources of capital and expect to incur substantial losses in 2012 and subsequent years.At December 31, 2011, EME had corporate cash and cash equivalents of $951 million and $498 million of available 24Table of Contentsborrowing capacity under its $564 million revolving credit facility maturing in June 2012 and Midwest Generation had cash and cash equivalents of $213 million and $497 million of available borrowing capacity under its $500 million credit facility maturing in June 2012. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, EME terminated its revolving credit facility and there can be no assurance that Midwest Generation will be eligible to draw on its credit facility prior to maturity. Any replacements of these credit lines will likely be on less favorable terms and conditions, and there is no assurance that EME will, or will be able to, replace these credit lines or any portion of them.As of December 31, 2011, EME's consolidated debt was approximately $4.9 billion, of which $1.2 billion was nonrecourse project debt of EME's subsidiaries and the balance was senior unsecured debt of EME. In addition, EME's subsidiaries had $2.6 billion of long-term, power plant lease obligations that are due over a period ranging up to 23 years. Compliance with current and forthcoming environmental requirements will add to EME's near-term liquidity needs.Unless energy and capacity prices increase, EME expects that it will experience further losses and reductions in cash flow in 2012 and subsequent years. EME's liquidity will be strained by a continuation of recent adverse trends combined with pending debt maturities, higher operating costs and the need to retrofit its coal-fired plants to comply with governmental regulations. EME's and Midwest Generation's deteriorating financial results and below-investment grade credit status may limit their ability to extend or replace credit facilities, including those maturing in 2012, should they choose to do so, and the terms and conditions of any refinancing could be substantially less favorable than those in previous credit facilities, depending on market conditions. In the case of a further downgrade, EME expects that these negative effects would become more pronounced. If cash flow and other means for assuring liquidity are unavailable or insufficient, EME may be unable to complete environmental improvements at its coal plants (which in turn could lead to unit shutdowns) or to pay its senior debt as it matures. If EME's credit facilities are not replaced, EME's ability to hedge its merchant coal exposure or carry out its trading activities may also be limited. The terms of EME's and its subsidiaries' debt instruments may restrict EME's ability to sell assets or incur secured indebtedness, and EME's subsidiaries' debt instruments may limit EME's ability to seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance debt to satisfy liquidity needs. For further discussion, see "EMG: Liquidity and Capital Resources" in the MD&A.EME receives tax-allocation payments from Edison International only if, and only to the extent that, EME is included in the consolidated tax returns of Edison International and Edison International is able to utilize tax losses and credits generated by EME. EME may be required to make tax-allocation payments to Edison International.EME's right to receive tax-allocation payments and the amount of and timing of those payments are dependent on the inclusion of EME in the consolidated income tax returns of Edison International and other factors, including the amount of consolidated taxable income and net operating losses of Edison International, and other tax items of EME, its subsidiaries, and other subsidiaries of Edison International. Edison International has not been able to fully utilize EME's consolidated tax losses and credits as a result of accelerated tax deductions taken by the consolidated group under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the 2010 Tax Relief Act and SCE's priority over EME in the utilization of available tax benefits. Realization of EME's tax losses and tax credits is not expected to begin again until at least 2013, subject to future changes in tax laws and Edison International's taxable income, and it may take several years before such benefits can be fully utilized. As of December 31, 2011, EME had recorded deferred tax assets of $520 million related to loss carryforwards and unused credits. EME expects to make tax-allocation payments to Edison International during 2012 of approximately $185 million as a result of the reallocation of tax obligations from an expected Edison International consolidated net operating loss in 2011.These arrangements are subject to the terms of the tax-allocation and payment agreements among Edison International, EME and other Edison International subsidiaries. The agreements under which EME makes and receives tax-allocation payments may be terminated by the immediate parent company at any time, by notice given before the first day of the first year with respect to which the termination is to be effective. However, termination does not relieve any party of any obligations with respect to any tax year beginning prior to the notice. See "EMG: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Intercompany Tax-Allocation Agreement" in the MD&A.Regulatory and Environmental RisksThe controls imposed on EMG's coal plants as a result of environmental regulations, including the Combined Pollutant Standard may require material expenditures or unit shutdowns.Capital expenditures relating to required environmental controls for EMG's coal plants (including the CPS, to which all of Midwest Generation's coal-fired generating units are subject) are expected to be significant. In February 2012, EME decided to shut down the Fisk Station by the end of 2012 and the Crawford Station by the end of 2014 and concluded it was less likely to install environmental controls at the Waukegan Station and Joliet Unit 6. EME may ultimately decide to shut down the Waukegan Station and Joliet Unit 6, and possibly other units, rather than make improvements. Unit shutdowns could have 25Table of Contentsan adverse effect on EMG's business, results of operation and financial condition. For more information about EMG's plans for environmental compliance, see "Item 1. Business—Environmental Regulation of Edison International and Subsidiaries—Air Quality—Nitrogen Oxide and Sulfur Dioxide," "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies" in the MD&A, and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments."Market RisksEMG has substantial interests in merchant energy power plants which are subject to market risks related to wholesale energy prices because they operate without long-term power purchase agreements. Wholesale energy prices have substantially declined in recent years.EMG's merchant energy power plants do not have long-term power purchase agreements. Because the output of these power plants is not committed to be sold under long-term contracts, these projects are subject to market forces which determine the amount and price of energy, capacity and ancillary services sold from the power plants. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced when it is to be used. As a result, the wholesale power markets are subject to significant and unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time. Due to the volume of sales into PJM from the coal plants, EMG has concentrated exposure to market conditions and fluctuations in PJM. Prices for power and capacity have declined significantly due largely to lower natural gas prices and have been affected in recent years by increased use of demand response technology, changes in final demand for power during the economic slowdown, and technological developments that have increased access to natural gas shale reserves, resulting in substantial declines in market prices for natural gas which supplies power plants that compete with EMG's coal plants.Market prices of energy, capacity and ancillary services sold from these power plants are influenced by multiple factors beyond EMG's control, and thus there is considerable uncertainty whether or when current depressed prices will recover. EMG's hedging activities may not cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility, and the level of coverage will vary over time. The effectiveness of EMG's hedging activities may depend on the amount of credit available to post collateral, either in support of performance guarantees or as cash margin, and liquidity requirements may be greater than EMG anticipates or will be able to meet. EMG cannot provide assurance that its hedging strategies will successfully mitigate market risks. For more detail on these matters, see "EMG: Market Risk Exposures—Commodity Price Risk" in the MD&A.EMG's financial results can be affected by changes in prices, transportation cost, and supply interruptions related to fuel, sorbents, and other commodities used for power generation and emission controls.In addition to volatile power prices, EMG's business is subject to changes in the cost of fuel, sorbents, and other commodities used for power generation and emission controls, and in the cost of transportation. These costs can be volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of EMG's control. The price at which EMG can sell its energy may not rise or fall at the same rate as a corresponding rise or fall in commodity costs. Operations at the coal plants are dependent upon the availability and affordability of coal which is available only from a limited number of suppliers and which, in the case of Midwest Generation, is transported by rail under a multi-year long-term transportation contract. All of these factors may have an adverse effect on EMG's financial condition and results of operations. See "EMG: Market Risk Exposures—Commodity Price Risk" in the MD&A.Competition could adversely affect EMG's businessEMG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business some of whom may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, greater ability to withstand losses, larger staffs or more experience than EMG. Multiple participants in the wholesale markets, including many regulated utilities, have a lower cost of capital than most merchant generators and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms, allowing them to build, buy and upgrade generation assets without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments. These factors could affect EMG's ability to compete effectively in the markets in which those entities operate. Newer plants owned by EMG's competitors are often more efficient than EMG's facilities and may also have lower costs of operation. Over time, some of EMG's merchant facilities may become obsolete in their markets, or be unable to compete with such plants.Operating RisksEMG's capital projects may not be successful.EMG's capital projects are subject to risks including, without limitation, risks related to financing, construction, permitting, 26Table of Contentsand governmental approvals. EME may be required to spend significant amounts before it can determine whether a project is feasible or economically attractive. The timing of such projects may be delayed beyond the date that equipment is ready for installation, in which case EMG may be required to incur material equipment and/or material costs with no deployment plan at delivery. Due to competing capital needs, EMG's further development of its renewable business will depend upon the availability of third-party equity capital.EMG's projects may be affected by general operating risks and hazards customary in the power generation industry. EMG may not have adequate insurance to cover all these hazards.The operation of power generation facilities is a potentially dangerous activity that involves many operating risks, including transmission disruptions and constraints, equipment failures or shortages, and system limitations, degradation and interruption. EMG's operations are also subject to risks of human performance and workforce capabilities. There can be no assurance that EMG's insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or protect against all hazards to which EMG may be subject, or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available, or at all. EMG has a number of older facilities that are subject to higher risks of failure or outage, and EMG has in the past experienced serial defects in certain models of wind turbines deployed at its wind projects.Uncertainties in EMG's future operations could affect its ability to attract and retain skilled people.Uncertainties concerning EMG's future operations could affect its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with experience in the energy industry. If EMG is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, its results of operations will be negatively affected.ITEM 1B
