PART I

ITEM
1.                Business

Business
Overview

Health Care Property
Investors, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint
ventures (collectively, “HCP” or the “Company”), invests primarily in real
estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. Health Care
Property Investors, Inc. is a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
organized in 1985. The Company is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with
operations in Nashville, Tennessee and Orlando, Florida, and its portfolio
includes interests in 731 properties. The Company acquires healthcare
facilities and leases them to healthcare providers and provides mortgage
financing secured by healthcare facilities. The Company’s portfolio includes: (i) senior
housing, including independent living facilities (“ILFs”), assisted living
facilities (“ALFs”), and continuing care retirement communities (“CCRCs”); (ii) medical
office buildings (“MOBs”); (iii) hospitals; (iv) skilled nursing
facilities (“SNFs”); and (v) other healthcare facilities, including
laboratory and office buildings. For business segment financial data, see our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

References herein to “HCP,”
the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” include Health Care Property Investors, Inc.
and its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context
otherwise requires.

On our internet website, www.hcpi.com, you can access,
free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, the SEC maintains an internet website
that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
regarding issuers, including HCP, that file electronically with the SEC at

Healthcare
Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the
United States, representing 16% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) in 2004
and growing at a rate faster than the overall economy.

The delivery of
healthcare services requires real estate and as a consequence, healthcare
providers depend on real estate to maintain and grow their businesses. HCP
believes that the current healthcare real estate market provides an investment
opportunity due to the:

·       Likelihood of consolidation
of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector;

·       Specialized nature of
healthcare real estate investing; and

·       Compelling demographics
driving the demand for healthcare services.

Senior citizens are the
largest consumers of healthcare services. According to the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid, on a per capita basis, the 75 years and older segment of the
population spends 75% more on healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old
segment and nearly 300% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

We are organized to invest
in healthcare-related facilities. Our primary goal is to increase shareholder
value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal
is based on three principles—opportunistic investing, portfolio
diversification, and conservative financing.

Opportunistic
Investing

We make real estate
investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term
shareholder value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take
advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria. We invest in
properties directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing,
depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.

Portfolio
Diversification

We believe in maintaining
a portfolio of healthcare-related real estate diversified by sector, geography,
operator and investment product. Diversification within the healthcare industry
reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business.
This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on
individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of 


 4 






maintaining
diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations under our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws on the percentage of our total assets
that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or
in the number of properties which we may invest in, lease or lend to a single
operator. With investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate, HCP
can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio
as a whole, rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific
property type.

Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative
balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic
investing approach and portfolio diversification principles. We maintain our
conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and
maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of
credit. Our debt is primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising
interest rates on our operations. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term
duration of our leases with long-term fixed-rate financing.

In underwriting our
investments, we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with
our assessment of risk. We may structure transactions as master leases, require
indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or
security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our
investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For
short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for
other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for
longer-term financing through public offerings or from institutional investors.
We may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock. We may
incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire. We may also
obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in
which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired.

Competition

Our properties compete
with the facilities of other landlords and healthcare providers. The landlords
and operators of these competing properties may have capital resources
substantially in excess of ours or of the operators of our facilities. The
occupancy and rental income at our properties depend upon several factors,
including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring
patients to the facilities, competing properties and healthcare providers, and
the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area. Private,
federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may
also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and
their tenants. Virtually all of our properties operate in a competitive
environment in which tenants, patients and referral sources, including
physicians, may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to
time.

Investing in real estate
is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment
companies, healthcare operators and other institutional investors when we
attempt to acquire properties. Increased competition reduces the number of
opportunities that meet our investment criteria. If we do not identify
investments that meet our investment criteria, our ability to increase
shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited.

Transaction Overview

Mergers with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and
CNL Retirement Corp.

On October 5, 2006,
we closed our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CRP”) for
aggregate consideration of approximately $5.3 billion. In the CRP merger, we
paid an aggregate of $2.9 billion of cash, issued 22.8 million shares of our
common stock, and we either assumed or refinanced approximately $1.7 billion of
CRP’s outstanding debt. We initially financed the cash consideration paid to
CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the transaction through an
offering of senior notes, a draw down under new term and bridge loan facilities
and a new three-year revolving credit facility. Our results of operations for
2006 include the results of the combined company beginning on October 5,
2006. For more information about the CRP merger, see Note 5 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Simultaneous with the
closing of the merger with CRP, we also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. (“CRC”)
for aggregate consideration of approximately $120 million, which included the
issuance of 4.4 million shares of our common stock.

Investment Transactions

During
2006, including the CRP merger discussed above, we acquired interests in
properties aggregating $5.9 billion with an average yield of 6.9%. Our 2006
investments were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 77% senior
housing facilities; (ii) 19% MOBs; (iii) 3% hospitals; and (iv) 1%
other healthcare facilities. Our 2006 real estate investments included the
following:

·       During the three months
ended March 31, 2006, we acquired 13 medical office buildings for $138
million, including non-managing member LLC units (“DownREIT units”) valued at
$6 million, in related transactions. The 13 buildings, with 730,000 rentable
square feet, have an initial yield of 7.3%.

·       On May 31, 2006, we
acquired nine assisted living and independent living facilities for $99
million, including assumed debt valued at $61 million, through a sale-leaseback
transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two
ten-year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0%
with annual CPI-based escalators.

·       On November 30, 2006,
we acquired four assisted living and independent living facilities for $51
million, through a sale-leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial
lease term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal options. The initial annual
lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual escalators based on the Consumer
Price Index (“CPI”).

During 2006, we sold 83
properties for $512 million and recognized gains of approximately $275 million.
These sales included 69 SNFs sold on December 1, 2006, for $392 million
with gains of approximately $226 million. On or before December 1, 2006,
tenants for nine SNFs exercised rights of first refusal to acquire such
facilities. The sales of the nine SNFs for $52 million are expected to be
completed by June 30, 2007.

On November 17, 2006,
we purchased $300 million senior secured notes issued by a HCA Inc. These notes
accrue interest at 9.625%, mature on November 15, 2016, and are secured by
second-priority liens on the HCA’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ assets.

On January 31, 2007,
we acquired three long-term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36
million in exchange for 11 skilled nursing facilities valued at approximately
$77 million. The three acquired properties have an initial lease term of ten
years, with two ten-year renewal options, and an initial 


 6 






contractual
yield of 12% with escalators based on the lessee’s revenue growth. The acquired
properties are included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties
leased to the same operator.

On February 9, 2007,
we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers,
six medical office buildings, and three parking garages, for approximately $347
million, including non-managing member LLC units (“DownREIT units’’) valued at
$174 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.3%.

Joint Venture Transactions

On October 27, 2006,
we formed an MOB joint venture with an institutional capital partner. The joint
venture includes 13 properties valued at $140 million and encumbered by $92
million of mortgage debt. Upon formation, we received approximately $36 million
in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of $0.7 million. We retained
an effective 26% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and
will receive ongoing asset management fees.

On November 30, 2006,
we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of General Electric Company in
HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (“HCP MOP”), for $141 million. We are now the
sole owner of the venture and its 59 MOBs, which have approximately four
million rentable square feet. At closing, $251 million of mortgage debt
encumbered these MOBs.

On January 5, 2007,
we formed a senior housing joint venture with an institutional capital partner.
The joint venture includes 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered
by a $686 million secured debt facility. Upon formation, we received
approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of
$5.4 million. Including the $446 million recently received from the secured
debt facility with Fannie Mae discussed below, we received $726 million in
total proceeds. We retained a 35% interest in the venture, will act as the
managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees.

Capital Market Transactions

During 2006, in addition
to the mortgage debt issued under the Fannie Mae facility discussed below, we
obtained $165 million of ten-year mortgage financing with a weighted average
effective yield of 6.36% in five separate transactions. We received net
proceeds of $162 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and
for other general corporate purposes.

On February 27, 2006,
we issued $150 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes
were priced at 99.071% of the principal amount for an effective yield of
5.788%. We received net proceeds of $149 million, which were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

On September 19,
2006, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300
million of floating rate notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in
2011, and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2016. We received net proceeds of
$994 million, which together with cash on hand and borrowings under the new
credit facilities were used to repay our then existing credit facility and to
finance the CRP merger.

On October 5, 2006,
in connection with the CRP merger, we entered into credit agreements with a
syndicate of banks providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The
credit facilities included a $0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two-year
term loan, and a $1.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. As of December 31,
2006, we had repaid the bridge loan and borrowings under the term loan were
reduced to $0.5 billion. In addition, through our capital market transactions
in January 2007, we fully repaid the balance outstanding under the term
loan.


 7










On November 10, 2006,
we issued 33.5 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $960 million, which were used to repay our bridge loan facility
and borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

On December 4, 2006,
we issued $400 million of 5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes
were priced at 99.768% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%.
We received net proceeds of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings
under our term loan facility.

On December 21, 2006,
in anticipation of our senior housing joint venture that closed on
January 5, 2007, we expanded an existing secured debt facility with Fannie
Mae to $686 million, receiving $446 million in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility
bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.66%. The funds from the expanded
debt facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility.

On January 19, 2007,
we issued 6.8 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $261 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term
loan facility.

On January 22, 2007,
we issued $500 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes
were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%.
We received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to repay borrowings
under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

Other Events

During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we issued approximately 797,000 shares of our common
stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average
price per share of $28.68 for proceeds of $22.9 million.

Quarterly dividends paid
during 2006 aggregated $1.70 per share. On January 29, 2007, we announced
that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of
$0.445 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 21,
2007, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 5,
2007. The annualized rate of distribution for 2007 is $1.78, compared with
$1.70 for 2006, which represents a 4.7% increase. Our Board of Directors has
determined to continue its policy of considering dividend increases on an
annual rather than quarterly basis.

for additional information on our business segments.



(1)          Senior
housing facilities are stated in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom
units). Medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities are measured
in square feet. Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are measured by
licensed bed count.

(2)          Investment for owned
properties represents the carrying amount of real estate assets, including
intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, and
excludes assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations.
Investment for direct financing leases represents the carrying amount of direct
financing leases, after deducting interest accretion. Investment for mortgage
loans receivable and unconsolidated joint ventures represents the carrying
amount of our investment.

(3)          On January 5, 2007,
we formed a joint venture for 25 senior housing assets and retained a 35%
interest in the venture. The carrying value of the 25 senior housing facilities
is classified as real estate held for contribution on our consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006. On October 13, 2006, we formed a joint
venture with 13 MOBs and retained an effective 26% interest in the venture. The
disposition of a portion of our interest in the 25 senior housing assets and 13
MOBs met the definition under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144
(“SFAS No. 144”) for the assets to qualify as held for sale, however, the
operations are not classified as discontinued operations resulting from our
continuing interest in the ventures. The operating results of these properties
prior to the formation of the ventures are included in the Company’s continuing
operations. The number of properties, capacity, square footage, and investment
for the 13 MOBs are included under the caption of unconsolidated joint
ventures.

(4)          Net
Operating Income from Continuing Operations (“NOI”) is a non-GAAP supplemental
financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate
properties. We define NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements,
less property level operating expenses, which excludes depreciation and
amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest
expense and discontinued operations. We believe NOI provides investors relevant
and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our
real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make
decisions about resource allocations and assess property level performance. We
believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP (U.S. generally
accepted accounting principals) measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an
alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP
since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may
not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may
use different methodologies for calculating NOI. The following reconciles NOI
to Net Income for 2006 (in thousands):

Healthcare Sectors and Property Types

We have investments in
senior housing facilities, medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing
facilities, and other healthcare facilities. Certain tenants of our properties
are reliant on government reimbursements, such as those from Medicare and
Medicaid. See “Governmental Regulation” for the potential impact on the value
of our investments and our results of operations. The following describes the
nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers.

Senior Housing Facilities.   We have interests in 337 senior housing facilities,
including four properties in unconsolidated joint ventures. Senior housing
properties include ILFs, ALFs and CCRCs, which cater to different segments of
the elderly population based upon their needs. Services provided by our tenants
in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through
private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs
such as Medicaid and Medicare.

·       Independent Living Facilities.   ILFsare designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to
live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as
housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need
assistance with activities of daily living (“ADLs”), including bathing, eating
and dressing. However, residents have the option to contract for these
services.

·       Assisted Living Facilities.   ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those
who need help with ADLs yet require limited medical care. The programs and
services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs,
beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions,
meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These
facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences
ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher
levels of personal assistance for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other
forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local
regulations.

·       Continuing Care Retirement Communities.   CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative
is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health
and medical needs change, thus allowing residents to “age in place.” Some CCRCs
require a substantial entry fee or buy-in fee, and most also charge monthly
maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.
CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and
independent upon entry.


 11 






Medical Office Buildings.   We
have interests in 260 MOBs, including 14 properties owned by unconsolidated
joint ventures. These facilities typically contain physicians’ offices and
examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service
space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation
clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to
commercial office buildings, they require more plumbing, electrical and
mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in
every room, brighter lights and special equipment such as medical gases.

Hospitals.   We
have interests in 35 hospitals, which include 13 acute care, 11 rehabilitation,
four long-term acute care and seven specialty hospitals. Services provided by our tenants in these
facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance
and HMOs), or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

·       Acute Care Hospitals.   Acute care hospitals offer a
wide range of services such as fully-equipped operating and recovery rooms,
obstetrics, radiology, intensive care, open heart surgery and coronary care,
neurosurgery, neonatal intensive care,
magnetic resonance imaging, nursing units, oncology, clinical laboratories,
respiratory therapy, physical therapy, nuclear medicine, rehabilitation
services and outpatient services.

·       Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals.   Long-term acute care
hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that
require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring, or emergency back-up
than that available in most skilled nursing-based programs.

·       Specialty Hospitals.   Specialty hospitals are licensed
as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as
cardiac, orthopedic and women’s conditions or specific procedures such as
surgery and are less likely to provide emergency services.

·       Rehabilitation Hospitals.   Rehabilitation hospitals
provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic
injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries,
orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.

Skilled Nursing
Facilities.   We have interests in 69 SNFs. SNFsoffer restorative, rehabilitative
and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and
sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenue
from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents
beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory
and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and
orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other
services. Certain skilled nursing facilities provide some of the foregoing
services on an out-patient basis. Skilled nursing services provided by our
tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources,
or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Other Healthcare
Facilities.   We have investments in 30 healthcare
laboratory and biotech research facilities. These facilities are designed to
accommodate research and development in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug
discovery and development, and predictive and personalized medicine. Our
investments include physician group practice clinic facilities, health and
wellness centers, and facilities used for other healthcare purposes. The
physician group practice clinics generally provide a broad range of medical
services through organized physician groups representing various medical
specialties. Health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative
health maintenance services.

Investment Products

Owned and Joint Venture Property Investments

The Company holds its
investments as wholly owned or in the form of unconsolidated joint ventures
with third-party investors. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in
731 properties, including 18 properties through joint ventures. Whether
owned wholly or through joint ventures, the owned properties may be
characterized as one of three types: triple-net leased property, operating
property or development property.

Triple-net Leased Properties:

Triple-net leased
properties are primarily single-tenant buildings leased to a healthcare
provider under a triple-net lease. Pursuant to triple-net leases, tenants pay
base rent and all operating expenses incurred at the property, including utilities,
property taxes, insurance, and repairs and maintenance. Certain leases contain
annual base rent escalations based on a predetermined fixed rate, an inflation
index or some other factor. Other leases may require tenants to pay additional
rent based upon the operator’s achievement of specific performance thresholds. The
amount of additional rent may be based on a percentage of the facility’s
revenues in excess of revenues for a specific base period or on the funds
available for lease payment after base rent and operating expenses. As of December 31,
2006, the weighted average remaining term, excluding unexercised renewal
options, on our triple-net leased properties is approximately 11 years.

We typically require credit enhancements to cover
short falls in the event the tenant does not generate enough cash flow to pay
rent. The ability of certain senior housing lessees to satisfy their
obligations under leases acquired from CRP depends primarily on the properties’
operating results. Some of these leases have credit enhancements that have
either expired or will expire either by the passage of time or upon the full
utilization of the credit enhancement. In addition, the terms of certain leases
acquired in the CRP acquisition also provide for the tenant to maintain
reserves to fund expenditures to refurbish buildings, premises and equipment to
maintain the facilities in a manner that allows for the operation of the
facilities for their intended purpose. To the extent the credit enhancements or
reserves are inadequate, the tenant may not be able to make rent payments to us
when due or we may be required to fund such amounts.

The
first year annual base rental rates on properties we acquired during 2006
ranged from 6.8% to 9.0% of the purchase price of the property. Rental rates
vary by lease, taking into consideration many factors, including:

·       creditworthiness
of the tenant;

·       operating
performance of the facility;

·       credit
support arrangements;

·       cost
of capital at the inception of the lease;

·       location,
type and physical condition of the facility;

·       barriers
to entry, such as certificates of need, competitive development and
constraining high land costs; and

·       lease term.


 13 






Operating
Properties:

Our operating properties
are typically multi-tenant medical office buildings that are leased to multiple
healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices) under a gross,
modified gross or net lease structure. Under a gross or modified gross lease,
all or a portion of operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants. Most of
our owned MOBs are managed by third-party property management companies and
21 are leased on a net basis while 239 are leased to multiple tenants
under gross or modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for
certain operating expenses. Regardless of lease structure, most of our leases
at operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses that are
either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index,
and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 15 years, with a
weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of December 31,
2006.

The following table
reflects the annual reduction in revenue (based on 2007 contractual lease
payments) for owned triple-net leased and operating properties resulting from
lease expirations, absent the impact of renewals, if any (in thousands):

(1)          Excludes direct
financing leases, assets classified as held for contribution, and assets held
for sale and classified as discontinued operations.

Development Properties:

We generally commit to
development projects only if they are at least 50% pre-leased. We use internal
and external construction management expertise to evaluate local market
conditions, construction costs and other factors to seek appropriate
risk-adjusted returns. During 2006, we completed and placed into service
approximately $36 million of development properties.

Investment Management Platform:

We co-invest in real
estate with institutional investors through partnerships, limited liability
companies, and joint ventures. We target investors with long-term investment
horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate. Typically,
we retain interests in the ventures ranging from 20% to 35% and serve as the
managing member. Our co-investment ventures generally allow us to earn
acquisition fees, asset management fees or priority distributions, and have the
potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on
performance of the venture. On October 27, 2006 and January 5, 2007,
a total of $1.3 billion in medical office and senior housing assets were placed
into joint ventures.

Investments in Secured Loans, Direct Financing Leases
and Debt Securities

We have investments in 10
mortgage loans secured by 11 properties that are owned and operated by 9 healthcare
providers. Our secured loan investments typically consist of senior mortgages
or mezzanine financing on individual properties or a pool of properties. At December 31,
2006, the carrying amount of these mortgage loans totaled $121.5 million. The
interest rates on mortgage loans outstanding at 


 14 






December 31,
2006 ranged from 7.5% to 13.5% per annum. Our mortgage loans generally include
prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions.

At December 31, 2006
we had investments in 32 properties that are accounted for under direct
financing leases with original terms that range from five to 35 years. Certain
leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the
properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial
investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements.

We also have investments
in senior secured second lien notes of HCA Inc., which are classified as debt
securities and are recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2006, the fair
value of these senior secured notes was $322.5 million and they are classified
as available for sale. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 9.625%, mature
in 2016, and are secured by second-priority liens on HCA’s and its subsidiary
guarantors’ assets. The issuer of these notes may elect to pay interest in
cash, by increasing the principal amount of the notes for the entire amount of
the interest payments, or by paying half of the interest in cash and half in
additional notes. The first payment due on May 15, 2007 is payable only in
cash. After November 15, 2011, all interest on these notes will be payable
in cash. If the issuer elects to pay with additional principal amounts or
additional notes, the accrual rate is at 10.375%.

(2)          106
properties managed by Sunrise and six properties managed by Brookdale were
acquired from CRP on October 5, 2006.

All of our properties
associated with the aforementioned operators are primarily under triple-net
leases. These operators, excluding Summerville, are subject to the
informational filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Financial and other information relating to these
operators may be obtained from their public reports.

According to public
disclosures by Tenet and Sunrise, these companies are experiencing various
legal, financial, and regulatory difficulties. We cannot predict with certainty
the impact, if any, of the outcome of these uncertainties on their financial
condition. The failure or inability of these operators to pay their obligations
could materially reduce our revenues, net income and cash flows, which could in
turn reduce the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends, cause
our stock price to decline and cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss
on the sale of the properties.

One of our hospitals
located in Tarzana, California is operated by Tenet and is affected by State of
California Senate Bill 1953, which requires certain seismic safety building
standards for acute care hospital facilities. See “Government Regulation—California
Senate Bill 1953” for more information.

Joint Ventures

Consolidated Joint
Ventures

At December 31,
2006, we held ownership interests in 23 consolidated limited liability
companies and partnerships that together own 85 properties and one mortgage,
and an interest in one unconsolidated joint venture including the following:

·       A
77% interest in Health Care Property Partners, which owns two hospitals, seven
skilled nursing facilities and has one mortgage on a skilled nursing facility.

·       A
93% interest in HCPI/Sorrento, LLC, which owns a life science facility.

·       A
90% interest in HCPI VPI Sorrento II, LLC, which owns four laboratory, office
and biotechnology manufacturing buildings.

·       A
95% interest in HCPI/Indiana, LLC, which owns six medical office buildings.

·       A
36% interest in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC, which owns 14 medical office buildings and
one assisted living facility.

·       A
70% interest in HCPI/Utah, LLC, which owns 18 medical office buildings.

assisted living facilities.

·       An 85% interest in HCP
Birmingham Portfolio LLC, which owns a 30% interest in HCP Ventures III, LLC. HCP
Ventures III, LLC owns 13 medical office buildings.

Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures

At December 31,
2006, we held ownership interests in six unconsolidated limited liability
companies and partnerships that together own 18 properties as follows:

·       An
effective 26% interest in HCP Ventures III, LLC which owns 13 medical office
buildings.

·       A
45% to 50% interest in each of four limited liability companies (Seminole
Shores Living Center, LLC—50%, Edgewood Assisted Living Center, LLC—45%,
Arborwood Living Center, LLC—45%, and Greenleaf Living Center, LLC—45%) which
each own an assisted living facility.

·       A 67% interest in Suburban
Properties, LLC which owns one medical office building.

Taxation of HCP

We believe that we have operated in such a manner as
to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year
ended December 31, 1985, and we intend to continue to operate in such a
manner. No assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to
continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof.

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will
generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion
of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment
substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., at the corporate and
stockholder levels) that generally 


 16 






results from investment in
a corporation. However, we will be required to pay federal income tax under
certain circumstances.

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or
association (i) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) the
beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by
transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) which would be
taxable, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as a domestic
corporation; (iv) which is neither a financial institution nor an
insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the
beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (vi) during
the last half of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the
outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or
fewer individuals; and (vii) which meets certain other tests, described
below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income
and assets. The Code provides that conditions (i) to (iv), inclusive, must
be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) must be met
during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.

There are presently two gross income requirements.
First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited
transactions” as defined below) for each taxable year must be derived directly
or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
property or from certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least
95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions)
for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75%
test and all other dividends, interest and gain from the sale or other
disposition of stock or securities. A “prohibited transaction” is a sale or
other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held for sale
to customers in the ordinary course of business.

At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we
must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at
least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate
assets, certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a
stock offering or long term public debt offering by us (but only for the
one-year period after such offering), cash, cash items and government
securities. Second, not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by
securities other than those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments
included in the 25% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned
by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and we may not own
more than 10% of the vote or value of the securities of a non-REIT corporation,
other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable REIT subsidiaries
or qualified REIT subsidiaries, each as defined below. Fourth, not more than
20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or
more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We own interests in various partnerships and limited
liability companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership
or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership
under the Code, Treasury Regulations provide that for purposes of the REIT
income and asset tests, the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share
of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company (determined in
accordance with its capital interest in the entity), subject to special rules related
to the 10% asset test, and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the
partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share. The
ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a
REIT may involve special tax risks, including the challenge by the Internal
Revenue Service (the “Service”) of the allocations of income and expense items
of the partnership or limited liability company, which would affect the
computation of taxable income of the REIT, and the status of the partnership or
limited liability company as a partnership (as opposed to an association
taxable as a corporation) for federal income tax purposes.

We also own interests in a number of subsidiaries
which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (each a “QRS”).
The Code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax
purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit
of such subsidiaries will be 


 17 






treated as our assets,
liabilities and such items. If any partnership, limited liability company, or
subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation
(and not as a partnership, QRS or taxable REIT subsidiary, as the case may be)
for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to satisfy the REIT asset
tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a REIT, unless
certain relief provisions apply. We believe that each of the partnerships,
limited liability companies, and subsidiaries (other than taxable REIT
subsidiaries) in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a
partnership, or disregarded entity (in the case of a 100% owned partnership or
limited liability company) or QRS, as applicable, although no assurance can be
given that the Service will not successfully challenge the status of any such
organization.

As of December 31, 2006, we owned interests in
two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries
(each a “TRS”). A REIT may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of
the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS,
provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally may engage in any
business, including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to
tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not manage or
operate a hotel or healthcare facility. A TRS is treated as a regular
corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income
and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be
imposed on a REIT if its rental, service or other agreements with its TRS, or
the TRS’s agreements with the REIT’s tenants, are not on arm’s-length terms.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to
distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in
an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “real
estate investment trust taxable income” (computed without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net
income, if any (after tax), from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid in the
taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared
before we timely file our tax return for such year, if paid on or before the
first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect
and specify the dollar amount in our tax return. To the extent that we do not
distribute all of our net long-term capital gain or distribute at least 90%,
but less than 100%, of our “real estate investment trust taxable income”, as
adjusted, we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax
rates. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year
at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95%
of our capital gain income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed
taxable income from prior periods, we would be required to pay a 4% excise tax
on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually
distributed.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, and certain relief provisions do not apply, we will be required
to pay tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable
income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in
which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required
to be made. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we
will also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to
state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory
relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce
distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial
indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial
investments in order to pay the resulting taxes.

We and our stockholders may be required to pay state
or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which
we or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us
and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences
discussed above.


 18 






We may also be subject to
certain taxes applicable to REITs, including taxes in lieu of disqualification
as a REIT, on undistributed income, on income from prohibited transactions, on
net income from foreclosure property and on built-in gains from the sale of
certain assets acquired from C corporations in tax-free transactions.

Government
Regulation

The healthcare
industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local laws. This government
regulation of the healthcare industry affects us because:

(1)         Governmental regulations
such as licensure, certification for participation in government programs, and
government reimbursement may impact the financial ability of some of our
operators to make rent and debt payments to us, which in turn may affect the
value of our investments, and

(2)         The amount of
reimbursement such operators receive from the government and other third
parties may affect the amounts we receive in additional rents, which are often
based on our operators’ gross revenue from operations.

These laws and regulations are subject to frequent and
substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and
regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law.
These changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or
impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and
the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. These
changes may be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing or effect of these
changes cannot be predicted. The failure of any tenant or borrower to comply
with such laws, regulations and requirements could affect its ability to
operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator’s
ability to make lease or debt payments to us, which in turn may affect the
value of our investments.

Fraud and Abuse Laws.   There
are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business
practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from or
are in a position to make referrals in connection with a government-sponsored
healthcare program, including, but not limited to, the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. These include:

·       The
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer,
payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or
to induce, the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients.

·       The
Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (Stark), which restricts physicians
from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment
may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the
physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship.

·       The
False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or
fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare
and Medicaid programs).

·       The
Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which is imposed by the Department of Health and
Human Services for fraudulent acts.

Each of these laws include criminal and/or civil
penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions, damage
assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments,
and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Imposition of any of
these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material
adverse effect on their operations, which could adversely affect our business.
Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals
to bring qui tam (whistleblower)
actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse 


 19 






laws. Some Medicare
Administrative Contractors (private companies that contract with Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to administer the Medicare
program) have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by skilled nursing
providers.

Environmental
Matters.   A wide variety of federal, state and
local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations
affect healthcare facility operations. Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a
secured lender (such as us) may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in
connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for
injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required
remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or
secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property,
and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of
such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such
property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, would
reduce our revenue. Although the mortgage loans that we provide and the leases
covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for
certain environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited
and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill
its indemnification obligations.

The
Medicare and Medicaid Programs.   Sources of
revenue for operators may include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid
programs, private insurance carriers, healthcare service plans and health
maintenance organizations, among others. Efforts to reduce costs by these
payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in
reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators. In
addition, the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and
regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicaid programs differ
from state to state but they are all subject to federally-imposed requirements.
At least 50% of the funds available under these programs are provided by the
federal government under a matching program. Medicaid programs generally pay
for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates;
skilled nursing facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates.
Medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenant-operated facilities,
and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may further reduce Medicaid
reimbursement, as the Act included cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over five
years to the Medicaid program. Increasingly, states have introduced managed
care contracting techniques into the administration of Medicaid programs. Such
mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement
to facilities. Other third-party payors in various states base payments on
costs, retail rates or, increasingly, negotiated rates. Negotiated rates can
include discounts from normal charges, fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated
rates.

Healthcare
Facilities.   The healthcare facilities in our
portfolio, including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living
facilities, and physician group practice clinics, are subject to extensive
federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and
regulations. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of
accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or
decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or
closure of the facility. Such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the
operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely
impact us.

Entrance
Fee Communities.   Certain of the senior housing
facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee
communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid
by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form
of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to
significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of
each facility’s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve
requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel
their contracts within a 


 20 






specified period of time,
lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and
similar matters. Such oversight and the rights of residents within these
entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the
operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us.

California Senate Bill
1953.   Our hospital located in Tarzana,
California is affected by State of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which
requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital
facilities. This hospital is operated by Tenet under a lease expiring in February 2009.
We and Tenet are currently reviewing the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital,
multiple plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for
completing the same, and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the
property. We cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to
be incurred prior to 2013 in order to make the facility SB 1953-compliant
through 2030, or the final allocation of any remediation costs between us and
Tenet. Rent on the hospital in 2006 and 2005 was $10.8 million in each year and
the carrying amount of the facility is $73.9 million at December 31, 2006.

Current
Developments

The healthcare industry continues to face various
challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure on
healthcare providers to control costs, the migration of patients from acute
care facilities into extended care and home care settings, and the vertical and
horizontal consolidation of healthcare providers.

Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing
laws, and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the
definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs
associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by
government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied
retroactively under certain circumstances. The ultimate timing or effect of
legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways.

In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was signed into
law. The Act established an 18-month moratorium on the “whole hospital
exception” to the Stark law, whereby physicians have been permitted to refer
patients for Designated Health Services to hospitals in which they have an
ownership interest. On August 8, 2006, CMS released its final report and
plan to address issues relating to physician investment in specialty hospitals.
Specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the
care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions, or hospitals
that perform certain surgical procedures. CMS’ strategic plan includes strict
enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws for improper investments,
disclosure of information regarding physician investment and compensation
arrangements, acceptance of emergency transfer cases even if the specialty
hospital lacks an emergency department, and changes to the hospital inpatient
prospective and ambulatory surgical center payment systems. CMS declined to
extend the moratorium on approving new specialty hospitals, despite a request
for an extension by two senators. In light of continued interest in specialty
hospital regulation, there is a risk that legislation could be adopted that
affects the operation of specialty hospitals. The specialty hospital issue is
controversial and after significant discussion and legislation, the current
federal government permitted operation of specialty hospitals; however, there
can be no assurance that a new Congress or Administration would continue
similar treatment of specialty hospitals. Our hospital tenants may face
additional competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals,
including specialty hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at tenant
hospitals.

In addition to the reforms enacted and considered by
Congress from time to time, state legislatures periodically consider various
healthcare reform proposals. Congress and state legislatures can be expected to
continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems, new
regulatory enforcement initiatives, and new payment methodologies.


 21










We believe that government
and private efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs will continue. These
trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for
certain services provided by some of our operators. In addition, recent trends
of hospitals providing more services to uninsured patients or on an outpatient
basis rather than inpatient basis may continue and could adversely affect the
profitability of our operators. We believe that the vast nature of the
healthcare industry, the financial strength and operating flexibility of our
operators, and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any
such trends. However, we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted, and
no assurance can be given that the healthcare reforms will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2006,
we had 165 full-time employees and no part-time employees, none of whom are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with
our employees to be good.

ITEM 1A.        Risk
Factors

You should
carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “Competition,”
“Government Regulation,” and “Taxation of HCP” and elsewhere in this report,
which risks are incorporated by reference into this section, before making an
investment decision regarding our company. The risks and uncertainties
described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional
risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely
to have a significant impact. All of these risks could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to
Our Operators

If our facility
operators are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to
generate income, they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us.

The healthcare industry is
highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the
future. Our operators are subject to competition from other healthcare
providers that provide similar services. Such competition, which has
intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate, has
caused the fill-up rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly
rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to
obtain for their services to decrease. The profitability of healthcare
facilities depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians
using the healthcare facilities or referring patients there, competitive
systems of healthcare delivery and the size and composition of the population
in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the
effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on
the revenues and income of the properties. If our operators are not competitive
with other healthcare providers and are unable to generate income, they may be
unable to make rent and loan payments to us, which could adversely affect our
cash flow and financial performance and condition.

The bankruptcy,
insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could
significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find
new operators.

Our financial position and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial
difficulties experienced by any of our major operators, including bankruptcy,
insolvency or a general downturn in the business, or in the event any of our
major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their
lease terms expire.

We are exposed to the risk
that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations, which may result
in their bankruptcy or insolvency. Although our leases and loans provide us the
right to terminate an investment, evict an operator, demand immediate repayment
and other remedies, the bankruptcy laws 


 22 






afford
certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An
operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid
rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding.

Tenet Healthcare
Corporation and Sunrise Senior Living account for a significant percentage of
our revenues and are currently experiencing significant legal, financial and
regulatory difficulties.

During 2006, Tenet
Healthcare Corporation and Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 9%
and 5%, respectively, of our revenues. The properties managed by Sunrise were
acquired from CRP on October 5, 2006. According to public disclosures,
Tenet and Sunrise are experiencing significant legal, financial and regulatory
difficulties. We cannot predict with certainty the impact, if any, of the
outcome of these uncertainties on our consolidated financial statements. The
failure or inability of Tenet or Sunrise to pay its obligations could
materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flows, which could adversely
affect the value of our common stock and could cause us to incur impairment
charges or a loss on the sale of the properties.

Our operators are
faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect
their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments.

In some states, advocacy
groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare
facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against operators. Also,
in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning
very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and
potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our
operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition,
the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may
continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting
the operations of healthcare facilities continues. Continued cost increases
could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage
payments, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and
litigation costs. Moreover, to the extent we are required to take back the
affected facilities, our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or
eliminated for an extended period of time.

Decline in the
skilled nursing sector and changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates
may have significant adverse consequences to us.

During 2006, our skilled
nursing properties accounted for approximately 7% of our revenues. Certain of
our skilled nursing operators and facilities continue to experience operating
problems in part due to a national nursing shortage, increased liability
insurance costs, and low levels of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Due to
economic challenges facing many states, nursing homes will likely continue to
be under-funded. These challenges have had, and may continue to have, an
adverse effect on our long-term care facilities and facility operators.

We may rely on
credit enhancements to our leases for minimum rent payments.

Our leases may have credit
enhancement provisions, such as guarantees or shortfall reserves provided by
tenants or operators. These credit enhancement provisions may terminate at
either a specific time during the lease term or once net operating income of
the property exceeds a specified amount. These provisions may also have limits
on the overall amount of the credit enhancement. After the termination of a
credit enhancement, or in the event that the maximum limit of a credit
enhancement is reached, we may only look to the tenant to make lease payments. In
the event that a credit enhancement has expired or the maximum limit has been
reached, or in the event that a provider of a credit enhancement is unable to
meet its obligations, our results of operations and our cash available for
distribution could be adversely affected if our properties are unable to
generate sufficient funds from operations to meet minimum rent payments and the
tenants do not otherwise have the resources to make the rent payments. Our
tenants may be thinly 


 23 






capitalized
entities that rely on the cash flow generated from the properties to fund rent
obligations under their lease.

Risks Related to Real Estate Investment and Our
Structure

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future
capital needs, and if our access to such capital is difficult or on
commercially unreasonable terms, we may not be able to meet maturing
commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

In
order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required,
among other things, to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of
our REIT taxable income. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not
be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection
with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, we rely on
external sources of capital. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all
or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make
the investments needed to grow our business, or to meet our obligations and
commitments as they mature, which could negatively affect the ratings of our
debt and even, in extreme circumstances, affect our ability to continue
operations. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which
we have little or no control, including:

·       general
market conditions;

·       the
market’s perception of our growth potential;

·       our
current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and

·       the market price of the
shares of our capital stock.

If we are unable to identify and purchase suitable
healthcare facilities at a favorable cost, we will be unable to continue to
grow through acquisitions.

Our ability to grow
through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to
identify suitable acquisition candidates that meet our criteria and are
compatible with our growth strategy. The acquisition and financing of
healthcare facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive. We may not be
successful in identifying suitable property or other assets that meet our
acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or
at all. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare
facilities at favorable prices, or if we are unable to finance such
acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business will suffer.

Unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of
new properties could reduce our profitability.

Our business strategy
contemplates future acquisitions. The acquisitions we make may not prove to be
successful. We might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures
relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities. Further,
newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that
would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We might never realize the
anticipated benefits of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our
profitability.

Since real estate investments are illiquid, we may not
be able to sell properties when we desire.

Real
estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to vary
our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market. This
inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely
affect our ability to service our debt. The real estate market is affected by
many factors that are beyond our control, including:

·       adverse
changes in national and local economic and market conditions;

·       changes
in interest rates and in the availability, costs and terms of financing;


 24 






·       changes
in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning and other
ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations;

·       the
ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;

·       changes
in operating expenses; and

·       civil
unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods,
which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses.

We cannot predict whether
we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us,
or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be
acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a
willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. In addition, there are
provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that may limit
our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.
These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to
adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Transfers of
healthcare facilities generally require regulatory approvals, and alternative
uses of healthcare facilities are limited.

Because transfers of
healthcare facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for
transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real
estate, there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor
operators or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor
operator. In addition, substantially all of our properties are healthcare
facilities that may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. If we
are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us, our revenue and
operations may suffer.

We may experience
uninsured or underinsured losses.

We generally require our
operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance
that covers us, as well as the operators, on most of our properties. Some types
of losses, however, either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure
against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur,
we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property,
as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event,
we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses
in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future.

Increases in
interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash
flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.

At December 31, 2006,
our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6.2 billion, of
which approximately $1.7 billion, or 27%, is subject to variable interest
rates. This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 6.1% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate
debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and
our ability to service our indebtedness.

Our acquisition of
additional properties may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity,
financial position, credit ratings and/or results of operations

As part of our business
strategy, we actively acquire healthcare facilities. Our recent acquisition of
CRP and CRC is an example of the execution of this strategy. We may acquire
healthcare facilities through various structures, including transactions
involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or
substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real
estate entities. We 


 25 






anticipate
that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods,
including proceeds from equity and/or debt offerings, advances under our credit
facilities and other incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. Any significant
acquisition or series of acquisitions financed by incurrence of indebtedness
may cause us to become highly leveraged and/or have a negative impact on the
credit ratings of our senior debt and preferred stock. Additionally, newly
acquired properties may fail to perform as expected. Inaccurate assumptions
regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic
estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating
expenses or the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards
established for its intended market position.

If we are unable to successfully integrate the
operations of CRP and other target companies, our business and earnings
may be negatively affected.

Mergers involve the
integration of companies that have previously operated independently.
Successful integration of the operations of these companies depend primarily on
our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and
personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. Mergers also pose other
risks commonly associated with similar transactions, including unanticipated
liabilities, unexpected costs and the diversion of management’s attention to
the integration of our operations with those of the target companies. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to integrate CRP or other target companies’
operations without encountering difficulties, including, but not limited to,
the loss of key employees, the disruption of its respective ongoing businesses
or possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.
Estimated cost savings are projected to come from various areas that our
management has identified through the due diligence and integration planning
process. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, we might not achieve
the economic benefits we expect to result from the merger, and this
may hurt our business and earnings. In addition, we may experience
greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of the
business of CRP or other target companies and/or may not realize expected
cost savings from mergers within the expected time frame, if at all.

Our business could be adversely impacted if we have
deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
financial reporting.

The design and
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or
misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial
reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the
time. In certain circumstances, the effectiveness of internal controls is
dependent on information received from independent third parties. For example,
we consolidate our investments in certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”)
when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If
management of the consolidated VIEs fails to provide us necessary financial
information either in a timely manner or at all, it could adversely impact our financial
reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. Deficiencies,
including any material weakness, in our internal controls over financial
reporting, which may occur in the future, could result in misstatements of our
results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in
our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We lease 76 properties to
a total of 9 tenants that have been identified as VIEs. We acquired these
leases (variable interests) on October 5, 2006 in our acquisition of CRP. CRP
determined they were not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, and we are
generally required to carry forward CRP’s accounting conclusions after the
acquisition relative to their primary beneficiary assessment. We may need to
reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in the future upon the
occurrence of a reconsideration event, as defined by FIN 46R. If we determine
that we are the primary beneficiary in the future and consolidate the 


 26 






tenant,
our financial statements would reflect the tenant’s facility level revenues and
expenses rather than lease revenue.

Federal Income Tax Risks

Loss of our tax status as a REIT would have
significant adverse consequences to us.

We currently operate and
have operated commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1985 in
a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Qualification as a REIT
involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances
not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must satisfy a number
of requirements regarding the composition of our assets. Also, we must make
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.
Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such
manner, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to
qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.

If we
lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will
substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and
interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our
stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

·       we
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing
our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

·       we
also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly
increased state and local taxes; and

·       unless
we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be
subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which
we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to
qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as
regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated
earnings and profits and we would not be required to make distributions to
stockholders.

As a result of all these
factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to
expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of
our common stock.

Certain property transfers may generate prohibited
transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
transaction.

From time to time, we may
transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal
Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as
inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business
would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100%
penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not
believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly
treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for
investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are
prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service
would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to
argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a
prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on
any gain allocable to us from the 


 27 






prohibited
transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely
affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real
estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes.

As a result of the CRP merger and the CRC merger, we
may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from CRP and CRC.

Prior to the CRP merger,
CRP was organized as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If CRP failed to
qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years, it would be required to pay
federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless statutory relief provisions
apply, CRP would have been disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which it lost qualification. Because
the CRP merger was treated for income tax purposes as if CRP sold all of its
assets in a taxable transaction to us, if CRP did not qualify as a REIT for the
taxable year of the merger, it would be subject to tax in respect of the
built-in gain in all of its assets. “Built-in gain” generally means the excess
of the fair market value of an asset over its adjusted tax basis. As
successor-in-interest to CRP, we would be required to pay these taxes. After
the merger, the nature of the assets that we acquired from CRP and the income
we derive from those assets may have an effect on our tax status as a REIT.

In connection with the CRP
merger, CRP’s REIT counsel rendered an opinion to us, dated as of the closing
date of the merger, to the effect that CRP qualified as a REIT under the Code
for the taxable years ending December 31, 1999 generally through December 31,
2005, CRP was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification
as a REIT, and CRP’s method of operation had enabled CRP to satisfy the
requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code for the taxable years
ending on or prior to the closing date of the merger. This opinion was based on
various assumptions and representations as to factual matters, including
representations made by CRP in a factual certificate provided by one of its
officers, as well as other oral and written statements of officers and other
representatives of CRP and others as to the existence and consequence of
certain factual and other matters.

As a result of the CRC
merger, we succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of CRC, including any
liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in connection with
the CRC merger. At the closing of the CRC merger, we received an opinion of CRC’s
counsel, and CRC and its stockholders received an opinion of their counsel,
substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations
and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, for federal income
tax purposes the CRC merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. To the extent that the CRC merger so
qualified, no gain or loss was recognized by CRC or us in the CRC merger. If
the CRC merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, the CRC merger would have been treated as a sale of CRC’s assets to
HCP in a taxable transaction, and CRC would have recognized taxable gain. In
such a case, as CRC’s successor-in-interest, we would be required to pay the
tax on any such gain.

Assuming that the CRC
merger qualified as a reorganization under the Code, we succeeded to the tax
attributes and earnings and profits of CRC. To qualify as a REIT, we must
distribute such earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which
the CRC merger occurred. Any adjustments of CRC’s income for taxable years
ending on or before the CRC merger, including as a result of an examination of
CRC’s tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, could affect the calculation
of CRC’s earnings and profits. If the Internal Revenue Service were to
determine that we acquired earnings and profits from CRC that we failed to
distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the CRC merger
occurred, we could avoid disqualification as a REIT by using “deficiency
dividend” procedures. Under these procedures, we generally would be required to
distribute any such earnings and profits to our stockholders within 90 days of
the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to
the Internal Revenue Service.


 28










The opinions of counsel
delivered in connection with the CRP merger and the CRC merger represent the
best legal judgment of counsel and are not binding on the Internal Revenue

ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the status of CRP as a REIT or
the tax consequences of the CRC merger, and there can be no assurance that the
Internal Revenue Service will agree with the conclusions in the above-described
opinions.
