Daniel J. Sullivan is the
President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. Mr. Sullivan will
retire effective January 5, 2007, and will be succeeded by David F.
Rebholz, who currently is FedEx Express’s Executive Vice President, Operations &
Systems Support. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and

FedEx Freight Segment

FedEx Freight

FedEx Freight provides
regional next-day and second-day and interregional LTL freight services and is
known for its exceptional service, reliability and on-time performance. Through
a comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems,
FedEx Freight provides regional LTL freight service to virtually all U.S. ZIP
Codes, including Alaska and Hawaii. FedEx Freight also offers a premium service
between all regions in the U.S., providing seamless coverage and industry-leading
transit times. FedEx Freight’s regional and interregional LTL freight service
is supported by a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally,
FedEx Freight serves Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America,
the Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased transportation. FedEx
Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge that applies to the majority of its
revenue. The indexed surcharge percentage is subject to weekly adjustment based
on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
of diesel fuel.

We are focused on expanding the FedEx Freight regional
LTL freight network — opening new service centers and increasing capacity at a
number of key locations — to better meet customer demand. For example, in 2006,
FedEx Freight opened four new service centers and expanded 12 others. In 2007,
FedEx Freight expects to add a long-haul LTL freight network and Canadian
operations by completing our pending acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian LTL
freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and certain affiliates. See “Strategy.”

FedEx Freight provides tailored shipping solutions to
help shippers meet tight deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx
Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with reduced transit times,
after-hours pickup or delivery, or same-day delivery. FedEx Freight specializes
in fast-cycle distribution. Currently, more than 85% of FedEx Freight shipments
are delivered next- or second-business-day. FedEx Freight’s fully integrated
Web site and other e-tools, including a bill of lading generator and e-mail
delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring customers closer
to their own account information. During 2006, FedEx Freight launched FedEx
Freight Advance Notice, a free service feature that provides customers with
greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. This new feature
uses the company’s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx
Freight customers via the Internet or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond
its estimated delivery date.

FedEx Freight has leveraged its relationships with
other FedEx operating companies to meet the increasingly global needs of
customers. For example, the FedEx Freight sales force sells FedEx Express 


 14 





freight services, and FedEx Services sales
representatives share LTL leads with their counterparts at FedEx Freight. The
sales effort is one phase of a broad initiative aimed at leveraging FedEx’s
competitive advantage in U.S. domestic freight services.

FedEx Freight subsidiary Caribbean Transportation
Services, Inc. (“CTS”) is the leading provider of airfreight forwarding
services between the United States and Puerto Rico, specializing in arranging
the shipment of heavyweight and oversized cargo. CTS, which also offers service
to the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, provides several delivery options for
door-to-door or airport-to-airport airfreight forwarder services, principally
to the medical, pharmaceutical and technology sectors.

As of May 31, 2006,
FedEx Freight had approximately 28,500 employees operating approximately 42,500
vehicles and trailers from a network of approximately 325 service centers. Douglas
G. Duncan is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which
is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary multiregional LTL
freight competitors are Con-Way Freight, a subsidiary of Con-way Inc. (formerly
CNF Inc.), YRC Regional Transportation (which comprises the USF regional
companies), a division of YRC Worldwide Inc. (formerly Yellow Roadway
Corporation), and UPS Freight (formerly Overnite Corporation).

FedEx Custom Critical

throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Among its divisions are
Surface Expedite, for exclusive-use and network-based transport of critical
shipments; White Glove Services, for shipments that require special
care-in-handling, such as temperature-sensitive materials; and Air Expedite,
which offers an array of air solutions to meet customers’ critical delivery
times. Service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including weekends

customers can quote, ship, track and map shipments; view and print out copies
of a shipment’s bill of lading, proof of delivery and invoice; and manage their
online accounts. FedEx Custom Critical utilizes approximately 1,400 trucks,
operated by owner-operators and their drivers, which are dispatched out of
approximately 150 geographically-based staging areas. FedEx Custom
Critical also provides door-to-door vehicle transport through its Passport Auto
Transport and AutoTrans subsidiaries.

FedEx Kinko’s Segment

FedEx Kinko’s is a global
leader in the document services market, offering a wide array of innovative business
solutions, including retail access to the full range of FedEx day-definite
ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services. We acquired
FedEx Kinko’s in February 2004. We have rebranded Kinko’s locations as
FedEx Kinko’s Office and Print Centers, converted FedEx World Service Centers
into full-service FedEx Kinko’s Ship Centers, and expanded FedEx Kinko’s
service offerings.

We are focused on
expanding the FedEx Kinko’s retail network, which will substantially increase
customer access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services and provide growth
opportunities in commercial document solutions and other business services. During
2006, FedEx Kinko’s opened 36 new locations, including eight internationally. In
2007, FedEx Kinko’s plans to open approximately 200 new locations.

As of May 31, 2006,
FedEx Kinko’s operations included approximately 1,300 FedEx Kinko’s Office &
Print Centers and Ship Centers in the United States and approximately 150
additional locations in ten other countries, as well as 40 commercial
production centers. These locations create an unmatched global network of
state-of-the-art printing and copying technology, which FedEx Kinko’s leverages
to provide highly differentiated, innovative solutions to its customers. In January 2006,
FedEx Kinko’s opened its new World Production Center, a 28,500 square foot
facility featuring state-of-the-art, commercial-grade 


 15 





printing equipment. The
World Production Center, which is located near the FedEx Express hub in
Memphis, allows FedEx Kinko’s to easily handle complex, large-scale orders from
commercial customers and quickly distribute the resulting documents anywhere in
the world.

FedEx Kinko’s specifically
focuses on key customer segments that are important to the other FedEx companies.
To small- and medium-sized business customers, FedEx Kinko’s provides complete
document management and meets basic office needs. To large corporate customers,
FedEx Kinko’s provides facilities management and outsourcing of copying,
printing and document management services. To the rapidly growing “mobile
professional” market segment, which includes business travelers and mobile
salespeople, FedEx Kinko’s provides a comprehensive “office on the road,”
including Internet access, videoconferencing and presentation support.

FedEx Kinko’s offers a
full range of black-and-white, color and custom printing, copying and binding
services and an increasingly broad array of other business services, including,
among others, facilities management and outsourcing, high-speed Internet access
and computer rental, Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) services, videoconferencing, and
signs and graphics production services. FedEx Kinko’s has capitalized on the
trend toward e-business, offering many Web-based services, including File,
Print FedEx Kinko’s, a free software tool that works over the Web to connect
Microsoft Windows desktop users to copying and printing services at FedEx Kinko’s
Office and Print Centers; and DocStore, an online ordering solution for digital
print-on-demand. FedEx Kinko’s also offers retail products, such as specialty
papers, greeting cards, printer cartridges, stationery and office supplies.

FedEx Kinko’s offers the
full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services at virtually all U.S.
locations and is adding FedEx shipping services at its international locations.
In addition, FedEx Kinko’s offers packing services at virtually all U.S. Office
and Print Centers, and packing supplies and boxes are included in FedEx Kinko’s
retail product assortment. By allowing customers to have unpackaged items
professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Kinko’s team members and then
shipped using any of the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and
time-definite global express shipping services, FedEx Kinko’s provides a
complete “pack-and-ship” solution.

FedEx Kinko’s is
headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Kenneth A. May is the President and Chief
Executive Officer of FedEx Kinko’s, which has approximately 22,000 employees.
FedEx Kinko’s competitors on the retail side of its business include locally
owned or franchised quick printers, office-supply superstores, such as
Staples, Inc., OfficeMax Incorporated and Office Depot, Inc., pack
and ship chains, such as The UPS Store, and small local and regional copy and
pack and ship shops. FedEx Kinko’s competitors on the facilities management and
corporate outsourcing side of its business include Xerox Global Services, IKON
Office Solutions, Inc. and Pitney Bowes Inc.

FedEx Services

FedEx Services provides a
convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling
us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of express and ground
services. FedEx Services provides much of the sales, marketing, information
technology and customer service support for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground.
Effective June 1, 2006, we moved several additional groups that are
responsible for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground customer information (credit,
collections and customer service) into a newly formed subsidiary of FedEx
Services named FedEx Customer Information Services, Inc. Bringing these
groups under a common management structure will help to ensure a consistent and
outstanding experience for our customers.


 16












Through FedEx Services, we
provide our customers with a high level of service quality, as evidenced by our
ISO 9001 certification for our global express and ground operations. ISO 9001
registration is required by thousands of customers around the world. FedEx’s
global certification, encompassing the processes of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground
and FedEx Services, enhances our single-point-of-access strategy and solidifies
our reputation as the quality leader in the transportation industry. ISO 9001
is currently the most rigorous international standard for Quality Management
and Assurance. ISO standards were developed by the International Organization
for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland to promote and facilitate
international trade. More than 150 countries, including European Union members,
the United States and Japan, recognize ISO standards.

T. Michael Glenn is the
President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in
Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2006, FedEx Services had approximately
10,150 employees.

Technology

In 1979, FedEx founder
Frederick W. Smith said, “The information about a package is as important as
the delivery of the package itself.”  Mr. Smith’s
vision for FedEx technology in 1979 was a radical idea. Yet, today’s FedEx is a
world leader in technology, and his vision remains at the core of our
comprehensive technology strategy.

Our technology strategy is
driven by our desire for customer satisfaction. We strive to build technology
solutions that will solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity,
convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our strategy is our
award-winning Web site, together with our integration solutions.

The fedex.com
Web site was launched over ten years ago, and during that time, customers have
used the Web site to track the status of over a billion packages online. The fedex.com Web site is widely recognized for its speed, ease
of use and customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our
customers ship packages, determine international documentation requirements,
track package status, pay invoices and access FedEx Kinko’s office and printing
services. Our FedEx Insight application provides customers with visibility and
package status of their inbound and outbound FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and
FedEx Freight shipments. Our FedEx Global Trade Manager online resource enables
customers to more easily navigate the complexities of international commerce by
helping them identify the documents they need to ship to and from specific
countries. FedEx Global Trade Manager also offers a currency converter,
profiles of regulatory information by country, a customs regulation guide and,
through its “Estimate Duties and Taxes” features, customers can estimate
applicable governmental charges, duties and fees. FedEx Billing Online provides
customers real-time access to their accounts, invoices and paid shipment
details.

We have extended the reach
of the fedex.com Web site to be accessible from
most wireless devices, making it faster and easier for U.S. and Canadian
customers to access real-time package status tracking information, rates and
drop-off location data for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments. Our
wireless service is available through Web-enabled devices, such as mobile
telephones, personal digital assistants and Research In Motion (RIM) devices
(such as the BlackBerry). FedEx also uses wireless data collection devices to
scan bar codes on shipments. Our data collection device, the FedEx PowerPad,
uses Bluetooth wireless technology to give our couriers wireless access to the
FedEx network, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package information
available to our customers.

We design our e-commerce
tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our customers’ applications,
as well as into third-party software being developed by leading e-procurement,
systems integration and enterprise resource planning companies. Our FedEx Ship
Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers
manage their shipping and associated processes.

Marketing

The
FedEx brand name is a symbol for high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx
is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. Special emphasis is
placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important
assets. In addition to traditional print and broadcast advertising, we promote
the FedEx brand through corporate sponsorships and special events. For example,
FedEx sponsors:

·       The
National Football League, as its “Official Delivery Service Sponsor”

·       The
PGA TOUR and the Champions Tour golf organizations, as their “Official Shipping
Company”

·       A
Joe Gibbs Racing car in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series

·       FedExField,
home of the NFL’s Washington Redskins

·       The
FedEx Orange Bowl, host of one of college football’s Bowl Championship Series games

·       FedExForum,
the home of the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies

·       The
FedEx Kinko’s Classic, a PGA Champions Tour event

·       The
BMW WilliamsF1 Formula One racing team

·       The
French Open tennis tournament

In 2006, FedEx and the PGA
TOUR announced the establishment of the FedEx Cup, a new season-long points
bonus program for players and the centerpiece to the entire PGA TOUR season. The
inaugural FedEx Cup program will begin in January 2007.

FedEx Global Supply Chain Services

FedEx Services offers a
range of supply chain solutions, including transportation management,
fulfillment and fleet services, through its FedEx Global Supply Chain Services
subsidiary. FedEx Global Supply Chain Services focuses on information
technology-sensitive business to meet the needs of its customers and to drive
transportation business to other FedEx operating companies. FedEx Global Supply
Chain Services’ service offerings use advanced electronic data interchanges to
speed communications between customers and their suppliers, resulting in more
cost-effective solutions and enhanced levels of customer service. The
operations of FedEx Global Supply Chain Services were included in the FedEx
Ground segment through 2006.

In June 2006, FedEx
Global Supply Chain Services introduced FedEx Critical Inventory Logistics, a
new supply chain service that will enable customers to more efficiently manage
high-value and time-critical inventory. FedEx Critical Inventory Logistics will
focus on customers in telecommunication, semiconductor, biomedical and other
high-technology industries. The new service will use the varied transportation
networks of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom
Critical and will allow customers to deploy replacement parts and devices at
FedEx Kinko’s locations throughout the United States.

Trademarks

The “FedEx” trademark,
service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx,
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Kinko’s, FedEx Services,
FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx
Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are
trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation for
which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file. We have
authorized, 


 18 





through licensing
arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade
names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our
business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service
marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing
brand awareness.

Regulation

Air.   Under
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of
Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise
regulatory authority over FedEx Express.

The FAA’s regulatory
authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation,
including aircraft standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as
personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability
of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx
Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119
of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration
and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety
and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.

The DOT’s authority
relates primarily to economic and security aspects of air transportation. The
DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory
matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx
Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express
to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on
a worldwide basis. FedEx Express’s international authority permits it to carry
cargo and mail from several points in its U.S. route system to numerous points
throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and
is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment
of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to
serve foreign points is subject to the DOT’s approval and generally requires a
bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier
must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide
specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation
rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its
air network in the most efficient manner.

In 2001, the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act transferred responsibility for aviation security
from the FAA to the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) within the
DOT, and ultimately, the Department of Homeland Security. In May 2006, the
TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security requirements for air
cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft. The TSA is currently seeking
comments on a draft version of a new all-cargo aircraft security program, which
would implement the new rules. Until the required security program is
finalized, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have
on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible,
however, that these rules or other future security requirements for air
cargo carriers could impose material costs on us.

FedEx Express participates
in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S.
Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express’s
wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national
emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft
requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established
each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation
in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military
cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other
carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for charter flights.

Ground.   The
ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air
transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration
Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the
rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most 


 19 





motor carriers. States may
now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is
registered in those states that require registration.

The operations of FedEx
Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are
currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal
legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in
intrastate freight transportation.

Like other interstate
motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements
governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions
remain subject to both federal and state regulations.

Communication.   Because
of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its
aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the
Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the
Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express’s
activities pertaining to satellite communications.

Environmental.   Pursuant
to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing
aircraft noise. FedEx Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current
noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. FedEx Express’s aircraft
are also subject to, and are in compliance with, the regulations governing engine
emissions. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport
operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type
of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on
FedEx Express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply
but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express’s significant markets.
Congress’s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a
National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction
and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express’s international
operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in
which it operates.

We are subject to federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other
things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of
waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Kinko’s
copy machines and photo film developing operations. Additionally, we are
subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks,
hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of
effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management
programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.

Customs.   Our activities, including customs brokerage and
freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and
Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security
(customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission
(ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore
operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of
foreign jurisdictions.
