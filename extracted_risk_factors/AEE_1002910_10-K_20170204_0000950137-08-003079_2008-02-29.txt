    ITEM 1A.
    RISK FACTORS


 


    The electric and gas rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are
    allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings
    and are subject to legislative actions, which are largely
    outside of our control. Any such events that prevent UE, CIPS,
    CILCO or IP from recovering their respective costs or from
    earning appropriate returns on their investments could have a
    material adverse effect on future results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.


 


    The rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge
    for their services are the single most important item
    influencing the results of operations, financial position, and
    liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The electric and gas utility
    industry is highly regulated. The regulation of the rates that
    we charge our customers is determined, in large part, by
    governmental entities outside of our control, including the
    MoPSC, the ICC, and FERC. Decisions made by these entities could
    have a material adverse effect on results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.


 


    Our electric and gas utility rates are typically established in
    a regulatory proceeding that takes up to 11 months to
    complete. Rates established in those proceedings are primarily
    based on historical costs and include an allowed return on our
    investments by the regulator.


 


    Our company, and the industry as a whole, is going through a
    period of rising costs, including increases in fuel, purchased
    power, labor and material costs, coupled with significant
    increases in capital, operation and maintenance and financing
    costs targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and
    environmental compliance. Due to rising costs and the fact that
    our rates are primarily based on historical costs, UE, CIPS,
    CILCO and IP are not earning the allowed return established by
    their regulators (often referred to as regulatory lag). As a
    result, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to be entering a period
    where more frequent rate cases and



    13



Table of Contents




    requests for cost recovery mechanisms will be necessary. A
    period of increasing rates to our customers could result in
    additional regulatory, legislative, political, economic and
    competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.


 



    Illinois


 



    Pending Delivery
    Service Rate Cases


 


    Due to inadequate recovery of costs and low returns on equity
    experienced in 2007 and expected in 2008, CIPS, CILCO and IP
    filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase their
    annual revenues for electric delivery service by
    $180 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $31 million, CILCO – $10 million, and
    IP – $139 million). In addition, CIPS, CILCO and
    IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase
    their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by
    $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS –
    $15 million increase, CILCO – $4 million
    decrease and IP – $56 million increase). The ICC
    has until the end of September 2008 to render a decision in
    these rate cases. It could materially reduce the amount of the
    increase requested, or even reduce rates.


 



    Illinois Electric
    Settlement Agreement


 


    Due to the magnitude of rate increases that went into effect
    following the end of a rate freeze on January 2, 2007 under
    the Illinois Customer Choice Law, various legislators supported
    legislation that would have reduced and frozen the electric
    rates of CIPS, CILCO and IP at the level in effect prior to
    January 2, 2007, or would have imposed a tax on electric
    generation in Illinois to help fund customer assistance
    programs. The Illinois governor also supported rate rollback and
    freeze legislation. The rate rollback and freeze legislation
    would have prevented the Ameren Illinois Utilities from
    recovering from retail customers substantial portions of the
    cost of electric energy that the Ameren Illinois Utilities are
    obligated to purchase under wholesale contracts, and would also
    have caused the Ameren Illinois Utilities to under-recover their
    delivery service costs until the ICC could approve higher
    delivery service rates.


 


    In order to address these concerns, the Illinois electric
    settlement agreement was reached in 2007. Ameren, on behalf of
    Marketing Company, Genco and AERG, the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities, Exelon, on behalf of Exelon Generation Company LLC,
    Commonwealth Edison Company, Exelon’s Illinois electric
    utility subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings, Inc., Midwest Generation,
    LLC, and MidAmerican Energy Company agreed to contribute an
    aggregate of $1 billion over four years to fund both rate
    relief programs and a new power procurement agency, the IPA.
    Approximately $488 million of the funding is earmarked as
    rate relief for customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The
    Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG agreed to make
    aggregate contributions of $150 million over a four-year
    period, which commenced in 2007, with $60 million coming
    from the Ameren Illinois Utilities (CIPS –
    $21 million; CILCO – $11 million;
    IP – $28 million), $62 million from Genco
    and $28 million from AERG. The Illinois electric settlement
    agreement provides that if legislation freezing or reducing
    retail electric rates or imposing or authorizing a new tax,
    special assessment or fee on generation of electricity is
    enacted before August 1, 2011, then the remaining funding
    commitments will expire. Any funds set aside in support of those
    commitments will be refunded to the utilities and electric
    generators. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory
    Matters to our financial statements under Part II,
    Item 8, of this report for additional information on the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement.


 


    The following factors resulting from implementation of the
    Illinois electric settlement agreement could have a material
    adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position
    or liquidity of Ameren, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco or
    AERG:


 




    
    



        •    

        uncertainty as to the implementation of the new power
    procurement process in Illinois for 2008 and 2009, including ICC
    review and approval requirements, the role of the IPA, timely
    procurement of power and recovery of costs from the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities’ customers, and the ability of the
    Ameren Illinois Utilities or other electric distribution
    companies to lease or invest in generation facilities;








        •    

        the extent to which the IPA may exercise its statutory authority
    to build or invest in generation facilities;








        •    

        the increase in short-term or long-term borrowings by the Ameren
    Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG to fund contributions under
    the Illinois electric settlement agreement or to pay for or
    collateralize their obligations under future power purchase
    agreements;








        •    

        the failure by the electric generators that are party to the
    settlement agreement to perform in a timely manner under their
    respective funding agreements, which permit the Ameren Illinois
    Utilities to seek reimbursement for a portion of the rate relief
    that will be provided to certain of their electric
    customers; and








        •    

        the extent to which Genco and AERG will be successful in making
    future sales to meet a portion of Illinois’ total electric
    demand through the revised power procurement mechanism.





 


    If, notwithstanding the Illinois electric settlement agreement,
    any decision is made or any action occurs that impairs the
    ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully recover purchased power
    or distribution costs from their electric customers in a timely
    manner, and such decision or action is not promptly enjoined, it
    could result in material adverse consequences to Ameren, CIPS,
    CILCORP, CILCO and IP.


 



    Missouri


 


    With the expiration of multiyear electric and gas rate
    moratoriums, effective July 1, 2006, UE filed requests with
    the MoPSC in July 2006 for an electric rate increase of
    $361 million and for a natural gas delivery rate increase
    of $11 million. In March 2007, a stipulation and agreement
    approved by the MoPSC authorized an increase in annual natural
    gas delivery revenues of $6 million, effective
    April 1, 2007. As part of this stipulation and agreement,
    UE agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before
    March 15,



    
    14



Table of Contents




    2010. This agreement did not prevent UE from filing to recover
    infrastructure costs through an ISRS during this three-year rate
    moratorium. In February 2008, the MoPSC approved UE’s
    petition requesting the establishment of an ISRS to recover
    annual revenues of $1 million effective March 29, 2008.


 


    In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an order authorizing a
    $43 million increase in UE’s base rates for electric
    service based on a return on equity of 10.2%. Certain aspects of
    the MoPSC decision have been appealed by UE, the Office of
    Public Counsel and the Missouri attorney general to the Court of
    Appeals for the Western District of Missouri. In its order, the
    MoPSC denied UE the use of a fuel and purchased power cost
    recovery mechanism. UE expects to incur significant increases in
    fuel and related transportation costs over the next three years.
    Without a rate recovery mechanism, UE may experience regulatory
    lag and not fully recover these costs.


 


    Increased federal and state environmental regulation will
    cause UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI to incur large
    capital expenditures and increased operating costs. Future
    limits on greenhouse gas emissions would likely require UE,
    Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI to incur significant
    additional increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. Such expenses, if excessive, could result in the closures
    of coal-fired generating plants.


 


    About 61% of Ameren’s (UE – 54%,
    Genco – 60%, AERG – 95%, EEI –
    95%) generating capacity is coal-fired. About 84%
    (UE – 76%, Genco – 96%, AERG –
    99%, EEI – 100%) of its electric generation was
    produced by its coal-fired plants in 2007. The remaining
    electric generation comes from nuclear, gas-fired,
    hydroelectric, and oil-fired power plants. The EPA has issued
    final regulations with respect to
    SO2,
    NOx, and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. These
    regulations require significant additional reductions in the
    emissions from UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases,
    beginning in 2009, and significant capital expenditures.
    Missouri has adopted rules that substantially follow the federal
    regulations.


 


    Illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are
    significantly stricter than the federal regulations. In 2006,
    Genco, AERG, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an agreement
    that was incorporated into Illinois’ mercury emission
    regulations. Under the regulations, Illinois generators may
    defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by
    90% in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and
    SO2
    controls. In 2009, Genco, AERG and EEI will begin putting into
    service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions.


 


    In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated the federal
    Clean Air Mercury Rule. The court ruled that the EPA erred in
    the method used to remove electric generating units from the
    list of sources subject to the maximum available control
    technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The
    Court’s decision is subject to appeal, and it is uncertain
    how the EPA will respond. At this time, we are unable to
    determine the impact that this action would have on our
    estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules,
    our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.


 


    Ameren’s estimated capital costs based on current
    technology to comply with both the federal Clean Air Interstate
    Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule and related state implementation
    plans range from $4 billion to $5 billion by 2017
    (UE – $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion;
    Genco – $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion,
    AERG – $620 million to $760 million,
    EEI – $310 million to $410 million).


 


    Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming are subject to active consideration in the
    U.S. Congress. Ameren believes that currently proposed
    legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending
    upon proposed
    CO2
    emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits,
    and the method of allocating allowances. The moderate scenarios
    include provisions for a “safety valve” that provides
    a ceiling price for emission allowance purchases. As a result of
    our diverse fuel portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse gases
    varies among our generating facilities, but coal-fired power
    plants are significant sources of
    CO2,
    a principal greenhouse gas. Ameren’s current analysis shows
    that under some policy scenarios being considered in Congress,
    household costs and rates for electricity could rise
    significantly. The burden could fall particularly hard on
    electricity consumers and the Midwest economy because of the
    region’s reliance on electricity generated by coal-fired
    power plants. When consumed natural gas emits about half the
    amount of
    CO2
    as coal. As a result, economy-wide shifts favoring natural gas
    as a fuel source for electric generation also would affect the
    cost of nonelectric transportation, heating for our customers
    and many industrial processes. Under some policy scenarios being
    considered by Congress, Ameren believes that wholesale natural
    gas costs could rise significantly as well. Higher costs for
    energy could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and
    natural gas.


 


    Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate
    limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in
    significant increases in capital expenditures and operating
    costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or
    regulations might force Ameren and other similarly-situated
    electric power generators to close some coal-fired facilities.
    Mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on
    Ameren’s, UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s and
    EEI’s results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity.


 


    The EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative to
    determine whether modifications at a number of coal-fired power
    plants owned by electric utilities in the United States are
    subject to New Source Review requirements or New Source
    Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s
    inquiries focus on whether the best available emission control
    technology was or should have been used at such power plants
    when major maintenance or capital improvements were made.


 


    In April 2005, Genco received a request from the EPA for
    information pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air



    
    15



Table of Contents




    Act seeking detailed operating and maintenance history data with
    respect to its Meredosia, Hutsonville, Coffeen and Newton
    facilities, EEI’s Joppa facility, and AERG’s E.D.
    Edwards and Duck Creek facilities. In December 2006, the EPA
    issued a second Section 114(a) request to Genco regarding
    projects at the Newton facility. All of these facilities are
    coal-fired power plants. We are currently in discussions with
    the EPA and the state of Illinois regarding these matters, but
    we are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions.
    Resolution of the matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the future results of operations, financial position, or
    liquidity of Ameren, Genco, AERG and EEI. A resolution could
    result in increased capital expenditures, increased operations
    and maintenance expenses, and fines or penalties. We believe
    that any potential resolution would probably require the
    installation of emission control technology, some of which has
    already been planned for compliance with other regulatory
    requirements, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the
    Illinois mercury emission rules.


 


    New environmental regulations, voluntary compliance guidelines,
    enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a
    significant increase in capital expenditures and operating
    costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements,
    penalties and closure of power plants for UE, Genco, AERG and
    EEI. Although costs incurred by UE would be eligible for
    recovery in rates over time, subject to MoPSC approval in a rate
    proceeding, there is no similar mechanism for recovery of costs
    by Genco, AERG or EEI. We are unable to predict the ultimate
    impact of these matters on our results of operations, financial
    position or liquidity.


 


    The construction of, and capital improvements to, UE’s,
    CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s electric and gas utility
    infrastructure as well as to Genco’s, CILCO’s (through
    AERG) and EEI’s non-rate-regulated power generation
    facilities involve substantial risks, particularly as the Ameren
    Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over
    the next five years and beyond for compliance with environmental
    regulations and to make significant investments in our utility
    infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Should
    construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, it
    could have a material adverse impact on Ameren’s,
    UE’s, CIPS’, Genco’s, CILCORP’s,
    CILCO’s and IP’s results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.


 


    The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures
    over the next five years for compliance with environmental
    regulations and to make significant investments in their
    electric and gas utility infrastructure and their
    non-rate-regulated power generation facilities. The Ameren
    Companies estimate that they will incur up to $10.6 billion
    (UE – up to $4.9 billion; CIPS – up to
    $505 million; Genco – up to $2.1 billion;
    CILCO (Illinois Regulated) – up to $425 million;
    CILCO (AERG) – up to $870 million; IP –
    up to $1.1 billion; EEI – up to
    $555 million, Other – up to $205 million) of
    capital expenditures during the period from 2008 through 2012,
    including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and
    allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco,
    which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and
    estimated expenditures for compliance with EPA and state
    regulations regarding
    SO2
    and NOx emissions and mercury emissions from coal-fired power
    plants. Costs for these types of projects continue to escalate.


 


    Investment in Ameren’s regulated operations is expected to
    be recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts
    expended in non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether
    market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions
    reflecting increased costs generally for generators.


 


    The ability of the Ameren Companies to successfully complete
    those facilities currently under construction, and those
    projects yet to begin construction within established estimates
    is contingent upon many variables and are subject to substantial
    risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project
    management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor
    and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits,
    shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and
    contractors not performing as required under their contracts,
    changes in the scope and timing of projects, and other events
    beyond our control may occur that may materially affect the
    schedule, cost and performance of these projects. With respect
    to capital expenditures related to the installation of pollution
    control equipment, there is a risk that such electric generating
    plants would not be permitted to continue to operate if
    pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed
    deadlines or does not perform as expected. Should any such
    construction efforts be unsuccessful, the Ameren Companies could
    be subject to additional costs and the loss of their investment
    in the project or facility. The Ameren Companies may also be
    required to purchase additional electricity or gas to supply its
    customers until the projects are completed. All of these risks
    may have a material adverse effect on the Ameren Companies’
    results of operations, financial position or liquidity.


 


    Our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.


 


    We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various
    arrangements who owe us money, energy, coal or other commodities
    or services will not be able to perform their obligations.
    Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform,
    we might be forced to replace or to sell the underlying
    commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we
    might incur losses, or our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.


 


    Certain of the Ameren Companies have obligations to other Ameren
    Companies or other Ameren subsidiaries because of transactions
    involving energy, coal, or other commodities and services and
    because of hedging transactions. If one Ameren entity failed to
    perform under any of these arrangements, other Ameren entities
    might incur losses. Their results of operations, financial
    position or liquidity could be adversely affected, resulting in
    such nondefaulting Ameren entity being unable to meet its
    obligations to unrelated third parties. Hedging activities are
    generally undertaken with a view



    
    16



Table of Contents




    to the Ameren-wide exposures. Some Ameren Companies may
    therefore be more or less hedged than if they were to engage in
    such hedging alone.


 


    Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit
    retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee-related
    benefits may adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position, or liquidity.


 


    We offer defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover
    substantially all of our employees. Assumptions related to
    future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, and other
    actuarial matters have a significant impact on our earnings and
    funding requirements. In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an electric
    rate order that allows UE to recover through customer rates
    pension expense incurred under GAAP. Ameren expects to fund its
    pension plans at a level equal to the pension expense. Based on
    Ameren’s assumptions at December 31, 2007, and
    reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make
    annual contributions of $40 million to $65 million in
    each of the next five years. We expect UE’s, CIPS’,
    Genco’s, CILCO’s, and IP’s portion of the future
    funding requirements to be 65%, 8%, 11%, 5%, and 11%,
    respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change with
    actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any
    pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary
    contributions.


 


    In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of
    providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees
    have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that
    our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans
    for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.
    The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with
    our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and
    other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity.


 


    UE’s, Genco’s, AERG’s, Medina Valley’s
    and EEI’s electric generating facilities are subject to
    operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant
    outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses,
    liability, and increased purchased power costs.


 


    UE, Genco, AERG, Medina Valley, and EEI own and operate
    coal-fired, nuclear, gas-fired, hydroelectric, and oil-fired
    generating facilities. Operation of electric generating
    facilities involves certain risks that can adversely affect
    energy output, efficiency levels, operating costs, and
    investment levels. Among these risks are:


 




    
    



        •    

        increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation;








        •    

        facility shutdowns due to operator error or a failure of
    equipment or processes;








        •    

        longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages;








        •    

        disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate
    inventories;








        •    

        lack of water for cooling plant operations;








        •    

        labor disputes;








        •    

        inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;








        •    

        disruptions in the delivery of electricity;








        •    

        increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due
    to environmental regulation;








        •    

        unusual or adverse weather conditions, including
    drought; and








        •    

        catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, or other
    similar occurrences affecting electric generating facilities.





 


    Even though agreements have been reached with state and
    federal authorities, the breach of the upper reservoir of
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility could
    continue to have an adverse effect on Ameren’s and
    UE’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial
    condition.


 


    In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at
    UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. This
    resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which
    damaged a state park.


 


    In October 2006, FERC approved a stipulation and consent
    agreement between UE and FERC’s Office of Enforcement that
    resolves all issues arising from an investigation by FERC’s
    Office of Enforcement into alleged violations of license
    conditions and FERC regulations by UE, as the licensee of the
    Taum Sauk hydroelectric facility, that may have contributed to
    the breach of the upper reservoir. In November 2007, UE entered
    into a settlement agreement with the state of Missouri
    represented by the Missouri attorney general, the Missouri
    Conservation Commission and the Missouri Department of Natural
    Resources. The agreement resolved the state of Missouri’s
    lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief related to the
    December 2005 Taum Sauk breach. A business owners’ suit,
    which was filed in the Missouri Circuit Court of Reynolds County
    and remains pending, seeks damages relating to business losses
    and lost profit and unspecified punitive damages.


 


    In February 2007, UE submitted to FERC an environmental report
    to rebuild the upper reservoir at Taum Sauk. UE received
    approval from FERC in August 2007 and hired a contractor in
    November 2007. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir
    is in the range of $450 million. The Taum Sauk plant is
    expected to be out of service at least through the fall of 2009.


 


    As part of the settlement agreement with the state of Missouri,
    UE agreed not to attempt to recover from ratepayers in any
    future rate increase any in-kind or monetary payments to the
    state parties required by the settlement agreement or any costs
    incurred in the rebuilding of the upper reservoir (expressly
    excluding, however, enhancements, costs incurred due to
    circumstances or conditions that are currently not reasonably
    foreseeable, and costs that would have been incurred absent the
    December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at the Taum Sauk
    plant).


 


    If UE needs to purchase power because of the unavailability of
    the Taum Sauk facility during the rebuild of the upper
    reservoir, UE has committed to not seek these additional costs
    from ratepayers. The Taum Sauk incident is expected to reduce
    Ameren’s and UE’s 2008 pretax earnings by
    $15 million to $20 million. UE expects to face
    higher-cost sources of

    power, reduced interchange sales, and increased expenses, net of
    insurance reimbursement for replacement power costs.


 


    UE believes that substantially all damages and liabilities
    caused by the breach, including costs related to the settlement
    agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the
    plant, and the cost of replacement power, up to $8 million
    annually, will be covered by insurance. Insurance will not cover
    lost electric margins and penalties paid to FERC. Under
    UE’s insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are
    subject to review by its insurance carriers. Until litigation
    has been resolved and the insurance review is completed, among
    other things, we are unable to determine the total impact the
    breach may have on Ameren’s and UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond those
    amounts already recognized.


 


    The Missouri Parks Association and the Missouri Coalition for
    the Environment initiated legal proceedings over FERC’s
    decision to authorize the rebuilding of the upper reservoir at
    Taum Sauk. They seek injunctive and other relief. If they obtain
    injunctive relief, it could delay the construction of the
    rebuild and could delay the return of the plant to service.


 


    Genco’s, AERG’s, and EEI’s electric generating
    facilities must compete for the sale of energy and capacity,
    which exposes them to price risks.


 


    In December 2006, Genco and Marketing Company, and AERG and
    Marketing Company, entered into new power supply agreements
    whereby Genco and AERG sell and Marketing Company purchases all
    the capacity available from Genco’s and AERG’s
    generation fleets and such amount of associated energy
    commencing on January 1, 2007. All of Genco’s and
    AERG’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through
    Marketing Company.


 


    On December 31, 2005, EEI’s power supply contract with
    its affiliates, including UE, CIPS and IP, expired. EEI entered
    into a power supply agreement with Marketing Company whereby EEI
    sells 100% of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. All
    of EEI’s generating capacity now competes for the sale of
    energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through
    Marketing Company.


 


    To the extent that electricity generated by these facilities is
    not under a fixed-price contract to be sold, the revenues and
    results of operations of these non-rate-regulated subsidiaries
    generally depend on the prices that they can obtain for energy
    and capacity in Illinois and adjacent markets. Among the factors
    that could influence such prices (all of which are beyond our
    control to a significant degree) are:


 




    
    



        •    

        current and future delivered market prices for natural gas, fuel
    oil, and coal and related transportation costs;








        •    

        current and forward prices for the sale of electricity;








        •    

        the extent of additional supplies of electric energy from
    current competitors or new market entrants;








        •    

        the regulatory and pricing structures developed for evolving
    Midwest energy markets and the pace at which regional markets
    for energy and capacity develop outside of bilateral contracts;








        •    

        changes enacted by the Illinois legislature, the ICC, the IPA or
    other government agencies with respect to power procurement
    procedures;








        •    

        the potential for reregulation of generation in some states;








        •    

        future pricing for, and availability of, services on
    transmission systems, and the effect of RTOs and export energy
    transmission constraints, which could limit our ability to sell
    energy in our markets;








        •    

        the growth rate in electricity usage as a result of population
    changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of
    conservation programs;








        •    

        climate conditions in the Midwest market; and








        •    

        environmental laws and regulations.





 


    UE’s ownership and operation of a nuclear generating
    facility creates business, financial, and waste disposal
    risks.


 


    UE owns the Callaway nuclear plant, which represents about 12%
    of UE’s generation capacity and produced 19% of UE’s
    2007 generation. Therefore, UE is subject to the risks of
    nuclear generation, which include the following:


 




    
    



        •    

        potential harmful effects on the environment and human health
    resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the
    storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;








        •    

        the lack of a permanent waste storage site;








        •    

        limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
    available to cover losses that might arise in connection with UE
    or other U.S. nuclear operations;








        •    

        uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment
    amounts if insurance coverage is inadequate;








        •    

        increased public and governmental concerns over the adequacy of
    security at nuclear power plants;








        •    

        uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial
    aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their
    licensed lives (UE’s facility operating license for the
    Callaway nuclear plant expires in 2024);








        •    

        limited availability of fuel supply; and








        •    

        costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled
    maintenance.





 


    The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose
    licensing and safety requirements for nuclear generation
    facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the
    authority to impose fines, shut down a unit, or both, depending
    upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
    compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated
    by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at
    nuclear plants such as UE’s. In addition, if a serious
    nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material but
    indeterminable adverse effect on UE’s results of
    operations, financial position, or liquidity. A major incident
    at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC
    to limit or prohibit the operation or relicensing of any
    domestic nuclear unit.

    UE’s Callaway nuclear plant’s next scheduled refueling
    and maintenance outage is in the fall of 2008. During an outage,
    which occurs approximately every 18 months, maintenance and
    purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power
    available for sale decreases, compared with non-outage years.


 


    Operating performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant has
    resulted in unscheduled or extended outages. The operating
    performance at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant declined both in
    comparison with its past operating performance and in comparison
    with the operating performance of other nuclear plants in the
    United States. Ameren and UE are actively working to address the
    factors that led to the decline in Callaway’s operating
    performance. Management and supervision of operating personnel,
    equipment reliability, maintenance worker practices, engineering
    performance, training, and overall organizational effectiveness
    have been reviewed. Some actions have been taken. However,
    Ameren and UE cannot predict whether such efforts will result in
    an overall improvement of operations at Callaway. Any additional
    actions taken are expected to result in incremental operating
    costs at Callaway. Further, additional unscheduled or extended
    outages at Callaway could have a material adverse effect on the
    results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of
    Ameren and UE.


 


    Our energy risk management strategies may not be effective in
    managing fuel and electricity procurement and pricing risks,
    which could result in unanticipated liabilities or increased
    volatility in our earnings and cash flows.


 


    We are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas,
    fuel, electricity, emission allowances, and transmission
    congestion. Prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and
    emission allowances may fluctuate substantially over relatively
    short periods of time and expose us to commodity price risk. We
    use long-term purchase and sales contracts in addition to
    derivatives such as forward contracts, futures contracts,
    options, and swaps to manage these risks. We attempt to manage
    our risk associated with these activities through enforcement of
    established risk limits and risk management procedures. We
    cannot ensure that these strategies will be successful in
    managing our pricing risk or that they will not result in net
    liabilities because of future volatility in these markets.


 


    Although we routinely enter into contracts to hedge our exposure
    to the risks of demand, weather, and changes in commodity
    prices, we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations
    from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, our ability to
    hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility depends on
    liquid commodity markets. To the extent that commodity markets
    are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management
    strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions
    than we would prefer at a given time. To the extent that
    unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can
    adversely affect our results of operations, financial position,
    or liquidity.


 


    Our facilities are considered critical energy infrastructure
    and may therefore be targets of acts of terrorism.


 


    Like other electric and gas utilities, our power generation
    plants, fuel storage facilities, and transmission and
    distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities
    that could result in disruption of our ability to produce or
    distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such
    disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or
    significant additional costs for repair, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    position, or liquidity.


 


    Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the
    capital markets successfully. We may not have access to
    sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed.


 


    We use short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant
    source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not
    satisfied by our operating cash flow, including requirements
    related to future environmental compliance. As a result of
    rising costs and increased capital and operations and
    maintenance expenditures, coupled with near-term regulatory lag,
    we expect to need more short-term and long-term debt financing.
    The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly
    during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could
    negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our
    businesses. Our current credit ratings cause us to believe that
    we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However,
    events beyond our control, such as the recent collapse of the
    subprime mortgage market may create uncertainty that could
    increase our cost of capital or impair our ability to access the
    capital markets. Certain of the Ameren Companies rely in part on
    Ameren for access to capital. Circumstances that limit
    Ameren’s access to capital, including those relating to its
    other subsidiaries, could impair its ability to provide those
    Ameren Companies with needed capital. See the Credit Ratings
    section in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report for a
    discussion of credit rating changes in response to actions in
    Illinois with respect to the matter of power procurement
    commencing in 2007.
