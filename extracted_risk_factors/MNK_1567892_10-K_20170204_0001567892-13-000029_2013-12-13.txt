. Risk Factors included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Businesses and Product StrategiesWe manage our business in two reportable segments: Specialty Pharmaceuticals and Global Medical Imaging. Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Information regarding the product portfolios and business strategies of these segments is included in the following discussion. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, as well as other geographical information, is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.6Specialty PharmaceuticalsOur Specialty Pharmaceuticals segment has two major components (1) Brands, which we believe will continue to be a growth area for our business, and (2) Generics and API, which we expect will continue to grow and generate significant cash.Our Brands business markets branded pain drugs, including Exalgo, to physicians. In addition, we have an organic pipeline of branded pain products that are either in clinical trials or awaiting approval from the FDA. We also provide generic drugs, including a variety of product formulations containing hydrocodone, oxycodone, methylphenidate and several other controlled substances. We have a pipeline of controlled substance generic products either in development or awaiting approval from the FDA. Our API business provides bulk API products, including opioids and acetaminophen, to a wide variety of pharmaceutical companies, many of which are direct competitors of our Brands and Generics businesses. In addition, we use our API for internal manufacturing of our finished dosage products. In fiscal 2013, our Specialty Pharmaceuticals segment accounted for 56.5% of net sales from our operating segments. We expect this segment will represent a larger percentage of our net sales over the long term.We are committed to responsible prescribing, dispensing, use and storage of opioid analgesics to avoid misuse, abuse, addiction, diversion and overdose. In 2010, we started the Collaborating & Acting Responsibly to Ensure Safety Alliance ("the C.A.R.E.S. Alliance"), which offers free non-branded tools and materials to patients, pharmacists and physicians to foster the safe use of opioid pain medications. The C.A.R.E.S. Alliance sponsors drug take back programs among other initiatives. In addition to educational efforts, we work closely with our major distributors to monitor suspicious controlled substance orders and take active steps to limit potential diversion.BrandsWe started our Brands product portfolio in 2001 with the acquisition of a suite of products, including RESTORIL™ (temazepan) capsules, which is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia, and TOFRANIL-PM™ (imipramine pamoate) capsules, which is indicated for the relief of symptoms of depression, from Novartis International AG. In 2010, we shifted our focus to pain management and launched several dosage strengths of our then newly acquired pain product, Exalgo. We subsequently gained approval for a 32 mg dosage strength of Exalgo in August 2012. In addition, our NDA for Pennsaid 2% was accepted for filing in August 2013. Our development pipeline contains two extended-release formulations of controlled substance analgesics, Xartemis XR and MNK-155. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, our filing of Xartemis XR was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review. In November 2013, in response to additional data we submitted, the FDA extended their review of the Xartemis XR NDA by three months. MNK-155 has completed Phase III clinical trials and our NDA is expected to be filed with the FDA during the second half of fiscal 2014. These two development products are combination products formulated with potentially abuse-deterrent characteristics to address unmet needs in the acute pain market. Our long-term strategy is to advance these pipeline products and bring them to market to expand the size and profitability of our Brands business. Moreover, we plan to enhance our branded commercial infrastructure by building upon our controlled substance core and entering into attractive adjacencies in our U.S. markets while focusing on priority markets internationally, through product launches, co-promotions, line extensions and selective acquisitions, such as our acquisition of CNS Therapeutics in October 2012. We promote our branded products directly to physicians (including pain specialists, anesthesiologists and orthopedic surgeons) with our own direct sales force of over 200 sales representatives. To support the product launch of Xartemis XR, we have entered into an agreement to increase our Brands sales force by 150 to 200 contracted sales representatives. We also use our Brands sales force to promote other Brands products. Our products are purchased by wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains, among others, and are eventually dispensed by prescription to patients. We also market our branded products directly to managed care organizations to gain access to drug formularies and allow patients access to these medications. The following is a description of select products in our Brands product portfolio:•Exalgo, which was acquired in June 2009, is the only long-acting, once-daily form of hydromorphone in the U.S. market. In August 2012, the FDA approved a 32 mg tablet of Exalgo, which further expanded the patient population that Exalgo can effectively treat with a single daily dose. The 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg dosages of Exalgo were approved by the FDA in March 2010 for the treatment of chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients requiring continuous around-the-clock opioid analgesia for an extended amount of time, and have shown significant prescription growth since launch in April 2010. Exalgo was granted marketing exclusivity in the U.S. as a prescription medicine through March 2013 and is protected by two Orange Book-listed patents for a method of treating moderate to severe pain. Beginning in November 2013 for the 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg dosages and May 2014 for the 32 mg dosage, a third party will have the right, pursuant to agreements with us, to sell a generic version of Exalgo, contingent upon their obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. We expect sales of Exalgo to decrease in fiscal 2014 (compared with $126.1 million in fiscal 2013) when the third party enters the market pursuant to these agreements. Additionally, our patents for the 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg dosages expire in July 2014.7•GABLOFEN® (baclofen injection), which was acquired in October 2012 with the acquisition of CNS Therapeutics, is indicated for use in management of severe spasticity of cerebral or spinal origin in patients age four years and above. Gablofen is offered in three concentrations in vials and, after FDA approval in January 2013, in pre-filled syringes. Pre-filled syringes were created to reduce preparation steps, helping to simplify the pump refill process for patients receiving ITB TherapySM (Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy). Gablofen is delivered to the patient via intrathecal administration (an injection into the sheath around the spinal cord). Along with the acquisition of CNS Therapeutics came a developmental pipeline of an additional presentation and concentration of Gablofen, as well as several investigational pain products for intrathecal administration.Generics and APIWe market our API products to other pharmaceutical companies around the world, many of which are competitors of our Brands and Generics businesses. Additionally, we use our API for internal manufacturing of our finished dosage products. We are among the largest manufacturers of bulk acetaminophen in the world and the only producer of acetaminophen outside of Asia. We manufacture controlled substances under DEA quota restrictions and in calendar 2012 we believe we received approximately 40% of the total DEA quota provided to the U.S. market for the controlled substances we manufacture. We believe that our strong market position in the API business and allocation of opioid raw materials from the DEA is a competitive advantage for our API business and, in turn, for our Generics and Brands businesses. The strategy for our API business is based on manufacturing large volumes of high-quality product and customized product offerings, responsive technical services and timely delivery to our customers.We believe our Generics and API businesses represent the broadest available product line of opioid and other controlled substances (primarily DEA Schedules II and III). Our Generics and API businesses have a strong position in the controlled substance generics market with products, including hydrocodone, hydrocodone-containing tablets, oxycodone and oxycodone-containing tablets, all of which are significant products in the overall pain products industry, as well as methylphenidate and other controlled substance products. Historically, our primary competition has been other U.S. participants due to importation restrictions on controlled substance API and finished products. Our commitment to investment in our R&D infrastructure and capabilities has resulted in a pipeline of generic controlled substances, many of which are long-acting or hard to formulate products, which are under development or pending approval by the FDA. For example, we were the first company to receive FDA approval to manufacture and market a generic version of Concerta, a branded pharmaceutical for the treatment of ADHD. We market our generic products principally to drug wholesalers, large- and medium-size retail pharmacy chains, food store chains with pharmacies, pharmaceutical benefit managers that have mail order pharmacies and hospital buying groups.The following is a list of significant products and product families in our Generics and API product portfolio:•acetaminophen (API) products (represent 10%, 11% and 11% of our total net sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively);•hydrocodone (API) and hydrocodone-containing tablets;•oxycodone (API) and oxycodone-containing tablets; and •methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets USP (CII) ("Methylphenidate ER"), our generic form of Concerta.Global Medical ImagingOur Global Medical Imaging segment develops, manufactures and markets products in two areas: CMDS, used in CT and MRI imaging, and Nuclear Imaging, which provides radiopharmaceuticals used in single photon emission computed tomography ("SPECT") imaging for myocardial perfusion cardiac imaging and bone scans. In fiscal 2013, our Global Medical Imaging segment accounted for 43.5% of net sales from our operating segments. We believe our Global Medical Imaging segment provides a platform for growth in select markets outside the U.S. and provides cash flow that we will use to fund growth in our Specialty Pharmaceuticals segment. Therefore, we are focused on driving operating efficiencies in the Global Imaging segment to maximize operating margins and cash flow.8Contrast Media and Delivery SystemsOur contrast media include the brands Optiray for CT and Optimark™ for MRI, which are packaged in pre-filled syringes, vials and bottles. Our delivery systems include power injectors to allow delivery of contrast media into the patient, coordination of the timing of the injection with the CT or MRI scanner and delivery of the contrast media at a specific rate and volume. Our CMDS product strategy is based on differentiating our Optiray and Optimark brands with pre-filled syringes as opposed to vials or bulk containers that must be transferred to a syringe for injection. Pre-filled syringes offer a safer alternative to self-filled doses and offer risk reduction benefits that address The Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) and U.S. Pharmacopeia <797> guidelines. In addition, our pre-filled syringes are color coded and pre-labeled for easier medication management. Our delivery systems are marketed under the brand Optivantage™ Dual-Head ("Optivantage DH") for CT, Optistar™ for MRI and Illumena™ for cardiac catheterization laboratories. All of our injectors can accept both pre-filled syringes and our disposable syringes for use with saline and contrast media. We sell our CMDS products primarily to hospitals and imaging centers through group purchasing organizations ("GPOs").The following are significant products in our CMDS product portfolio:•Optiray (ioversol injection) is a low osmolar, lower viscosity and nonionic organically bound solution of iodine with a broad range of indications in CT imaging procedures, including peripheral and coronary arteriography, angiography and venography. Optiray is available in a Radio Frequency Identification ("RFID")-enabled Ultraject pre-filled syringe that, when combined with a RFID-enabled Optivantage DH CT Contrast Delivery System (a medical device used to synchronize the injection of contrast media with the CT scanner), provides a safer and more efficient method of delivering contrast media. Sales of our Optiray product represent 14%, 17% and 19% of our total net sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Optiray has been on the market for over 25 years. The high capital intensity in manufacturing API for Optiray products and our significant scale have contributed to the longevity of this product. •Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) is a non-ionic extracellular Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent ("GBCA") indicated for use with MRI in patients where abnormal vascularity of the brain or liver is suspected. It is the only GBCA approved by the FDA for administration by power injector and is available in pre-filled syringes to help reduce medication errors and improve patient safety.Nuclear ImagingOur Nuclear Imaging business manufactures radioactive isotopes for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Our nuclear radiopharmaceutical product offering includes both "hot" radioisotopes (primarily Tc-99m, used in approximately 82% of nuclear medicine imaging procedures) and "cold" kits (tagging agents that are paired with "hot" radioisotopes for diagnostic procedures). We have significant expertise in managing the highly regulated nature of the radioactive materials used to manufacture the isotope generators and the short half-life of isotopes, which precludes stockpiling and requires exacting execution along all aspects of the supply chain. We believe that our investment in Tc-99m generators in North America and Europe, our own Mo-99 processing facility and a very well-coordinated logistics network provides us with a competitive advantage. Our strategy for our Nuclear Imaging business is focused on bolstering the Tc-99m/Mo-99 supply chain through supplier diversification and our investments in generator manufacturing lines. We have entered into agreements to obtain Mo-99 from the Maria nuclear research reactor in Poland, the High Flux Reactor in the Netherlands and the BR2 reactor in Belgium, and are also able to purchase finished Mo-99 from other suppliers in the marketplace with whom we do not have long-term supply agreements. Going forward, we will continue to seek further diversification of our supplier base.We intend to ultimately eliminate the use of high enriched uranium ("HEU") in favor of using low enriched uranium ("LEU"). We currently use HEU targets for the production of Mo-99. In 2004, the U.S. National Security Administration established its Global Threat Initiative to, as quickly as possible, identify, secure and remove or facilitate the disposition of vulnerable, high-risk nuclear and radiological materials around the world. Included as one of the stated initiatives is the conversion by research reactors and isotope production facilities to LEU from HEU. We are in the process of converting our Mo-99 production operation in the Netherlands to LEU targets. For a discussion of how Mo-99 is used in our business, refer to "Raw Materials" within this Item 1. Business and . Risk Factors included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.11Intellectual PropertyWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and have also developed brand names and trademarks for other products. Generally, our Brands business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license or any group of patents, trademarks or licenses.The majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the branded pharmaceutical industry, an innovator product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there often are very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product's sales. The rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have some market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection or is based on the difficulties associated with replicating the product formulation or bioavailability.Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the product. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms, and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of pharmaceuticals. For example, the U.S., European Union ("E.U.") and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of certain new drugs during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity is also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, orphan drugs (drugs that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis or treatment of rare diseases or conditions) and medicines that may be useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity is independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict with certainty the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, the relative success or lack thereof by potential competitors' experience in product development and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registrations of such trademarks are for fixed terms and subject to renewal as provided by the laws of the particular country.Research and DevelopmentWe devote significant resources to the research and development of products and proprietary drug delivery technologies. We incurred R&D expenses of $165.7 million, $144.1 million and $141.5 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in R&D activities, as well as enter into license agreements to supplement our internal R&D initiatives. We intend to focus our R&D investments in the Specialty Pharmaceuticals segment, specifically investments to support our Brands business, where we believe there is the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Our low-risk, high productivity R&D approach will remain a key contributor to this growth. We currently expect our R&D investments to be in the range of 6% to 8% of annualized net sales. As noted in "Our Business and Product Strategies" included within this Item 1. Business, we market our products to pain specialists, anesthesiologists, neurologists and other physician specialists. In targeting future R&D spending, we focus on new product innovations that can be sold to these physician specialists.12The focus of our R&D within each of our businesses is noted below:•Brands. Our R&D strategy focuses on branded product development in the area of pain, other central nervous system areas, such as spasticity, and adjacent areas.•Generics and API. R&D within our Generics business is focused on developing Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") products that incorporate DEA-controlled substances and difficult to replicate formulations. Our API R&D is focused on process improvements to our core products, which is focused on increasing manufacturing yields to reduce our costs. We also selectively add API products to our portfolio where we believe we have created a unique, cost-effective and competitive manufacturing process. While we patent some of these API process improvements, many more are kept as trade secrets.•Global Imaging. Our R&D efforts in our Global Medical Imaging segment are primarily focused on driving efficiency throughout CMDS. In our Nuclear Imaging business, our efforts relate to expanding our portfolio of radioisotopes and better utilizing existing capacity. Key Areas of StudyOur R&D group is comprised of a number of highly experienced, trained and skilled individuals with nearly 25% holding Ph.D. degrees, who have developed expertise in a number of platform technologies, including:•formulation of oral solids in novel ways to mimic patented delivery systems;•formulation of parenteral products to provide sustained blood levels of select small molecules;•linker technology to attach small molecules to radioisotopes; and•abuse-deterrent characteristics for oral solids in both immediate-release as well as extended-release to limit the abuse and misuse of controlled substances.While many of these programs are in pre-clinical development, we anticipate that some of these will form the basis of novel products in the future. However, there is no guarantee that any of the studies underway will lead to the development of a product or whether or when such product will be further developed, launched and become commercially viable.Select Products in DevelopmentWe are presently developing a number of branded and generic products, some of which utilize novel drug-delivery systems, through a combination of internal and collaborative programs. As of September 27, 2013, we had two NDAs and five ANDAs awaiting review in the U.S. Our pipeline portfolio contains various products and product candidates that are reformulations of existing molecules for the treatment of pain and adjacent areas. The following are our most promising pipeline products:•Xartemis XR. Xartemis XR is a controlled-release, long-acting oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen that we are pursuing an indication for treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. Xartemis XR was formulated as a low-dose product to fulfill an unmet clinical need in the market with potentially abuse-deterrent characteristics. The formulation uses the patented Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed") Acuform™ drug-delivery technology, which we licensed in 2009. In July 2013, the FDA accepted our Xartemis XR NDA, filed as MNK-795, and granted it priority review. This acceptance marks a major milestone for us and is further evidence of our ability to advance our pipeline in both branded and generic products. In November 2013, in response to additional data we submitted, the FDA extended their review of the Xartemis XR NDA by three months. If approved, we anticipate launching Xartemis XR during the first half of fiscal 2014.•MNK-155. MNK-155 is a controlled-release, long-acting oral formulation of hydrocodone and acetaminophen that we are pursuing an indication for treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. MNK-155 was formulated as a low-dose product to fulfill an unmet clinical need in the market with potentially abuse-deterrent characteristics. The formulation uses the patented Depomed Acuform drug-delivery technology. MNK-155 has completed Phase III clinical trials and our NDA is expected to be filed with the FDA during the second half of fiscal 2014.•Pennsaid 2%. Pennsaid 2% is a new 2% formulation of diclofenac topical solution which we anticipate will be indicated for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee, and an extension of our Pennsaid franchise. This new formulation was studied using a twice-daily administration and is dispensed for topical usage by a new metered dose pump bottle. The NDA for Pennsaid 2%, originally filed as MNK-395, was submitted in June 2012 and, after repeating a pharmacokinetic study and submitting the results to the FDA, the application was accepted for filing in August 2013. If approved, we expect to launch this product in the second half of fiscal 2014.13•Intrathecal Product Development. Our acquisition of CNS Therapeutics in October 2012 provided us approved concentrations of Gablofen and a R&D pipeline that included an additional presentation and concentration of Gablofen, including the pre-filled syringes that were approved in January 2013. The R&D pipeline also included several investigational pain products, in various stages of development, which could provide an alternative to products that are only available today through compounding pharmacies. Additionally, this R&D pipeline may present opportunities for development of products that may be eligible to receive orphan drug designation from the FDA.•Methylphenidate ER 18 mg. Methylphenidate ER, a generic version of the branded Concerta, is for the treatment of ADHD. In February 2013, we submitted a supplement to our approved ANDA to include the 18 mg dosage strength. The FDA has accepted this supplement and granted it priority review. If approved, we expect to launch this product in the second half of fiscal 2014. We would then have all four dosage strengths available on the market, as we currently offer the 27 mg, 36 mg and 54 mg dosage strengths.Regulatory MattersQuality Assurance RequirementsThe FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs and medical devices conform to current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP"). The cGMP regulations that the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, and are designed to ensure that the finished products meet all the required identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulations, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("the FFDCA"). Other regulatory authorities have their own cGMP rules. Ensuring compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packaging, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs and ANDAs. If the FDA concludes that the facilities to be used do not or did not meet cGMP, good laboratory practice ("GLP") or good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements, it will not approve the application. Corrective actions to remedy the deficiencies must be performed and are usually verified in a subsequent inspection. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and API used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection, although the inspection can be waived when the manufacturer has had a passing cGMP inspection in the immediate past. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device facilities to assess their cGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, imported API and other components needed to manufacture products could be rejected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, usually after conferring with the FDA. In the case of domestic facilities, the FDA could initiate product seizures or, in some instances, require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product's manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an "unacceptable supplier," thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.United StatesIn general, drug manufacturers operate in a highly regulated environment. In the U.S., we must comply with laws, regulations, guidance documents and standards promulgated by the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS"), the DEA, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the NRC, the Customs Service and state boards of pharmacy.The FDA's authority to regulate the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals comes from the FFDCA. In addition to reviewing NDAs, for branded drugs, and ANDAs, for generic drugs, the FDA has the authority to ensure that pharmaceuticals introduced into interstate commerce are neither "adulterated" nor "misbranded." Adulterated means that the product may cause or has caused injury to patients when used as intended because it fails to comply with current cGMP. Misbranded means that the labels of, or promotional materials for, the product contain false or misleading information. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other federal and state regulations could result in product recalls or seizures, partial or complete suspension of manufacturing or distribution, refusal to approve pending NDAs or ANDAs, monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.14In order to market and sell a new prescription drug product in the U.S., a drug manufacturer must file with the FDA a NDA that shows the safety and effectiveness of (a) a new chemical entity that serves as the API, known as a 505(b)(1) NDA; or (b) a product that has significant differences from an already approved one, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA. Alternatively, in order to market and sell a generic version of an already approved drug product, a drug manufacturer must file an ANDA that shows that the generic version is "therapeutically equivalent," or behaves almost the same when taken by a patient to the branded drug product and, therefore, is substitutable.For all pharmaceuticals sold in the U.S., the FDA also regulates sales and marketing to ensure that drug product claims made by manufacturers are neither false nor misleading. Manufacturers are required to file copies of all product-specific promotional materials to the FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion prior to their first use by sales representatives. In general, such advertising does not require FDA prior approval. Failure to implement a robust internal company review process and comply with FDA regulations regarding advertising and promotion increases the risk of enforcement action by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Justice.For both NDAs and ANDAs, the manufacture, marketing and selling of certain drug products may be limited by quota grants for controlled substances by the DEA. Refer to "Drug Enforcement Administration" within this Item 1. Business for further information.NDA Process. The path leading to FDA approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity begins when the drug product is merely a chemical formulation in the laboratory. In general, the process involves the following steps:•Completion of formulation, laboratory and animal testing in accordance with GLP that fully characterizes the drug product from a pre-clinical perspective and provides preliminary evidence that the drug product is safe to test in human beings;•Filing with the FDA an Investigational New Drug Application that will permit the conduct of clinical trials (testing in human beings under adequate and well-controlled conditions);•Designing and conducting clinical trials to show the safety and efficacy of the drug product in accordance with GCP;•Submitting the NDA for FDA review, which provides a complete characterization of the drug product;•Satisfactory completion of FDA pre-approval inspections regarding the conduct of the clinical trials and the manufacturing processes at the designated facility in accordance with cGMP;•If applicable, satisfactory completion of a FDA Advisory Committee meeting in which the Agency requests help from outside experts in evaluating the NDA;•Final FDA approval of the full prescribing information, labeling and packaging of the drug product; and•Ongoing monitoring and reporting of adverse events related to the drug product, implementation of a REMS program, if applicable, and conduct of any required Phase IV studies.Clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, although they may overlap. The four phases are as follows:•Phase I trials are typically small (less than 100 healthy volunteers) and are designed to determine the toxicity and maximum safe dose of the drug product.•Phase II trials usually involve 100 to 300 participants and are designed to determine whether the drug product produces any clinically significant effects in patients with the intended disease or condition. If the results of these trials show promise, then a larger Phase III trial may be conducted.•Phase III trials are often multi-institution studies that involve a large number of participants and are designed to show efficacy. Phase III (and some Phase II) trials are designed to be pivotal, or confirmatory trials. The goal of a pivotal trial is to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product by eliminating biases and increasing statistical power.•In some cases, the FDA requires Phase IV trials, which are usually performed after the NDA has been approved. Such post-marketing surveillance is intended to obtain more information about the risks of harm, benefits and optimal use of the drug product by observing the results of the drug product in a large number of patients. A drug manufacturer may conduct clinical trials either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., but in all cases must comply with GCP, which includes (a) a legally effective informed consent process when enrolling participants; (b) an independent review by an Institutional Review Board to minimize and manage the risks of harm to participants; and (c) ongoing monitoring and reporting of adverse events related to the drug product.15In addition, a drug manufacturer may decide to conduct a clinical trial of a drug product on pediatric patients in order to obtain a form of marketing exclusivity as permitted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA"). Alternatively, the FDA may require a drug manufacturer, using its authority under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, to conduct a pediatric clinical trial. The goal of conducting pediatric clinical trials is to gather data on how drug products should best be administered to this patient population.The path leading to FDA approval of a NDA for a drug product that has significant differences from an already approved one is somewhat shorter. The FDA requires a drug manufacturer to submit data from either already published reports or newly conducted studies that show the safety and efficacy of those differences. Significant differences include different dosage strengths or route of administration.Under the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has the authority to collect fees from drug manufacturers who submit NDAs for review and approval. These user fees help the FDA fund the drug approval process. For fiscal 2014, the user fee rate has been set at $2,169,100 for a 505(b)(1) NDA and $1,084,550 for a NDA not requiring clinical data, generally a 505(b)(2) NDA. We expense these fees as they are incurred. The average review time for a NDA is approximately six months for priority review and ten months for standard review.ANDA Process. The path leading to FDA approval of an ANDA is much different from that of a NDA. By statute, the FDA waives the requirement for a drug manufacturer to complete pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and instead focuses on data from bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies generally involve comparing the absorption rate and concentration levels of a generic drug in the human body to that of the branded drug or Reference Listed Drug ("RLD"). In the event that the generic drug behaves in the same manner in the human body as the RLD, the two drug products are considered bioequivalent. The FDA considers a generic drug therapeutically equivalent, and therefore substitutable, if it also contains the same active ingredients, dosage form, route of administration and strength.In August 2013, it was reported that the average review time for an ANDA is about 35 months. In 2010, U.S. Congress passed into law the Generic Drug User Fee Act to address the FDA's backlog, which at the time was over 2,000 ANDAs. This legislation granted the FDA authority to collect, for the first time, user fees from generic drug manufacturers who submit ANDAs for review and approval, and the fees collected will help the FDA fund the drug approval process. For fiscal 2014, the user fee rate is set at $63,860 for an ANDA and $31,930 for a prior approval supplement to an ANDA. The FDA also will collect from generic drug manufacturers a separate one-time Drug Master File fee and separate annual manufacturing facility fees for API and finished drug products. These fees are expensed as incurred. The FDA anticipates that the approval process timeframe will not begin to improve until fiscal 2015.Aside from the backlog described above, the timing of FDA approval of ANDAs depends on other factors, including whether an ANDA holder has challenged any listed patents to the RLD and whether the RLD is entitled to one or more periods of marketing exclusivity under the FFDCA (such as pediatric exclusivity under the BPCA). In general, the FDA will not approve (but will continue to review) an ANDA in which the RLD holder has sued, within 45 days of receiving notice of the ANDA filing, the ANDA holder for patent infringement until either the litigation has been resolved or 30 months has elapsed, whichever is later.Patent and Non-Patent Exclusivity Periods. A sponsor of a NDA is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in a publication referred to as the Orange Book. Any person that files a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the type of NDA that relies upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed, or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of a previous drug, must make a certification in respect to listed patents. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for the RLD of the bases upon which the patents are challenged, and the holder of the RLD does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. If an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: (a) 30 months after receipt of the notice by the holder of the NDA for the RLD; (b) entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; (c) such time as the court may order; or (d) the expiration of the patent.One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day market exclusivity period ("generic exclusivity") granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to make a Paragraph IV certification and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patent(s) or is not sued. For a variety of reasons, there are situations in which a company may not be able to take advantage of an award of generic exclusivity. The determination of when generic exclusivity begins and ends is very complicated.The holder of the NDA for the RLD may also be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product. Generally, if the RLD is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept for filing any application that references the innovator's NDA for five years from the approval of the innovator's NDA. However, this five-year period is shortened to four years where a filer's ANDA includes a Paragraph IV certification. In other cases, where the innovator has provided certain clinical study information, the FDA may accept for filing, but may not approve, an application that references the innovator's NDA for a period of three years from the approval of the innovator's NDA.16Certain additional periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for use in a rare disease or condition or is studied for pediatric indications.Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies. For certain drug products or classes, such as transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products and extended-release and long-acting opioids, the FDA has the authority to require the manufacturer to provide a REMS that is intended to ensure that the benefits of a drug product (or class of drug products) outweigh the risks of harm. The FDA may require that a REMS include elements to ensure safe use to mitigate a specific serious risk of harm, such as requiring that prescriber have particular training or experience or that the drug product is dispensed in certain healthcare settings. The FDA has the authority to impose civil penalties on or take other enforcement action against any drug manufacturer who fails to properly implement an approved REMS program. Separately, a drug manufacturer cannot use an approved REMS program to delay generic competition.In December 2011, the FDA approved a single, class-wide REMS program for transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl ("TIRF") products (called "the TIRF REMS Access Program") in order to ease the burden on the healthcare system. TIRF products are opioids used to manage pain in adults with cancer who routinely take other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock. We were part of the original industry working group that collaborated to develop and implement the TIRF REMS Access Program. The goals of this program are to ensure patient access to important medications and mitigate the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and serious complications due to medication errors by: (a) prescribing and dispensing only to appropriate patients, including use only in opioid-tolerant patients; (b) preventing inappropriate conversion between fentanyl products; (c) preventing accidental exposure to children and others for whom such products were not prescribed; and (d) educating prescribers, pharmacists and patients on the potential for misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose. This program started in March 2012 and requires manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, dispensers and patients to enroll in a real-time database that maintains a closed-distribution system.In February 2009, the FDA requested that drug manufacturers help develop a single, shared REMS for extended-release and long-acting opioid products that contain fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and oxymorphone. In April 2009, the FDA announced that the "REMS would be intended to ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks associated with: (1) use of high doses of long-acting opioids and extended-release opioid products in non-opioid-tolerant and inappropriately selected individuals; (2) abuse; (3) misuse; and (4) overdose, both accidental and intentional." We were part of the original industry working group that collaborated to develop and implement this REMS program. Upon FDA approval of Exalgo in March 2010, we implemented the product-specific REMS program that was developed internally while continuing to collaborate on the class-wide REMS program. In July 2012, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program (called "the Extended-Release and Long-Acting Opioid Analgesics REMS") that affected more than 30 extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics (both branded and generic products). This REMS program requires drug manufacturers to make available training on appropriate prescribing practices for healthcare professionals who prescribe these opioid analgesics and to distribute educational materials on their safe use to prescribers and patients.As part of our ongoing commitment to the responsible prescribing, dispensing and safe use of prescription opioids beyond the FDA's REMS requirements, we launched the C.A.R.E.S. Alliance in September 2010. For further discussion on the C.A.R.E.S. Alliance, refer to "Our Business and Product Strategies" within this Item 1. Business.Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 ("CSA"). The CSA classifies drugs and other substances based on identified potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances, such as heroin and LSD, have a high abuse potential and have no currently accepted medical use; thus, they cannot be lawfully marketed or sold. Opioids, such as oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are either Schedule II or III controlled substances. Consequently, the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of these substances are highly regulated.The DEA regulates the availability of API, products under development and marketed drug products that are Schedule II or III by setting annual quotas. Every year, we must apply to the DEA for manufacturing quota to manufacture API and procurement quota to manufacture finished dosage products. Given that the DEA has discretion to grant or deny our manufacturing and procurement quota requests, the quota the DEA grants may be insufficient to meet our commercial and R&D needs. To date in calendar 2013, manufacturing and procurement quotas granted by the DEA have been sufficient to meet our sales and inventory requirements on most products. During calendar 2012, the initial hydrocodone manufacturing and procurement quota grants we received from the DEA were below the amounts requested and were therefore insufficient to meet customer demand. While we were granted additional quota, these shortfalls did result in lost sales of hydrocodone products, the amount of which was not significant. Future delay or refusal by the DEA to grant, in whole or in part, our quota requests could delay or result in stopping the manufacture of our marketed drug products, new product launches or the conduct of bioequivalence studies and clinical trials.In October 2013, the FDA announced its recommendation that the DEA reschedule hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin® (registered trademark of AbbVie Inc.) and our developmental product MNK-155) from Schedule III to Schedule II, thereby increasing regulatory controls on these drug products. The FDA expects to issue its formal recommendation to the DHHS in December 2013. This recommendation will begin a process that will lead to a final decision by the DEA on the scheduling of these products. At this time, it is too early to determine the degree of impact the hydrocodone rescheduling, if adopted, will have on our business. 17DEA regulations make it extremely difficult for a manufacturer in the U.S. to import finished dosage forms of controlled substances manufactured outside the U.S. These rules reflect a broader enforcement approach by the DEA to regulate the manufacture, distribution and dispensing of legally produced controlled substances. Accordingly, drug manufacturers who market and sell finished dosage forms of controlled substances in the U.S. typically manufacture or have them manufactured in the U.S.The DEA also requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring ("SOM") system includes well-defined due diligence, "know your customer" efforts and order monitoring.To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.We and, to our knowledge, our third-party API suppliers, dosage form manufacturers, distributors and researchers have all necessary registrations, and we believe all registrants operate in conformity with applicable registration requirements, under controlled substance laws.Government Benefit Programs. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, Tricare and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels, including requiring that all pharmaceutical companies pay rebates to individual states based on a percentage of their net sales arising from Medicaid program-reimbursed products. The federal and state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures, which could have material adverse consequences for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole and, consequently, also for us. However, we believe we have provided for our best estimate of potential refunds based on current information available.From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 created a new prescription drug coverage program for people with Medicare through a new system of private market drug benefit plans. This law provides a prescription drug benefit to seniors and individuals with disabilities in the Medicare program ("Medicare Part D"). Congress continues to examine various Medicare policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the Medicare program.In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, "the Healthcare Reform Act") provides for major changes to the U.S. healthcare system, which may transform the delivery and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. While some provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have already taken effect, most of the provisions to expand access to healthcare coverage will not be implemented until 2014 and beyond. The combination of these measures, which include the elimination of lifetime caps and no rescission of policies or denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions, could expand health insurance coverage by an estimated 32 million people in the U.S., improving patients' ability to obtain and maintain health insurance. Since much of the implementation is yet to take place, there are still many challenges and uncertainties ahead. Such a comprehensive reform measure will require expanded implementation efforts on the part of federal and state agencies embarking on rule-making to develop the specific components of their new authority. We intend to monitor closely the implementation of the Healthcare Reform Act and related legislative and regulatory developments. The overall impact of the Healthcare Reform Act reflects a number of uncertainties; however, we believe that the impact to our business will be largely attributable to changes in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, the imposition of an annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers and increased rebates in the Medicaid Fee-For-Service Program and Medicaid Managed Care plans. There are a number of other provisions in the legislation that collectively are expected to have a small impact, including originator average manufacturers' price for new formulations and the expansion of 340B pricing to new entities. 18Healthcare Fraud and Abuse LawsWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations, including the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state statutes, the U.S. Federal Sunshine Law and other parts of the Healthcare Reform Act, the False Claims Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products and are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. In addition, some states in the U.S. have enacted compliance and reporting requirements aimed at drug manufacturers.We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.Compliance ProgramsIn order to systematically and comprehensively mitigate the risks of non-compliance with regulatory requirements described within this Item 1. Business, we have developed what we believe to be a robust compliance program based on the April 2003 Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the Code of Ethics of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Anti-Bribery guidance, and other relevant government guidances and national or regional industry codes of behavior. We conduct ongoing compliance training programs for all employees and maintain a 24-hour ethics and compliance reporting hotline.As part of our compliance program, we have implemented internal cross-functional processes to review and approve all product-specific promotional materials, presentations and external communications to address the risk of misbranding or mislabeling our products through our promotional efforts. For example, we have established programs to monitor promotional speaker activities and field sales representatives, which includes a "ride along" program for field sales representatives similar to those included in recent Corporate Integrity Agreements from the OIG in order to obtain first-hand observations of how these approved materials are used. We have also implemented a comprehensive controlled substances compliance program, including anti-diversion efforts that go beyond the DEA's SOM requirements and we regularly assist federal, state and local law enforcement and prosecutors in the U.S. by providing information and testimony on our products and placebos for use by the DEA and other law enforcement agencies in investigations and at trial. As part of this program, we also work with some of our customers to help develop and implement what we believe are best practices for SOM and other anti-diversion activities.We believe our compliance program design also addresses our FDA, healthcare anti-kickback and anti-fraud, and anti-bribery-related activities.Outside the United StatesOutside the U.S., we must comply with laws, guidelines and standards promulgated by other regulatory authorities that regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, Health Canada, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the U.K., the Irish Medicines Board, the European Medicines Agency and member states of the E.U., the State Food and Drug Administration in China, the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan, the European Pharmacopoeia of the Council of Europe and the International Conference on Harmonization. Although international harmonization efforts continue, many laws, guidelines and standards differ by region or country.We currently market our products in Canada, in various countries in the E.U., and in the Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asia-Pacific regions. The approval requirements and process vary by country, and the time required to obtain marketing authorization may vary from that required for FDA approval. Certain drug products and variations in drug product lines also must meet country-specific and other local regulatory requirements. The following discussion highlights some of the differences in the approval process in other regions or countries outside the U.S.19European Union. Marketing authorizations are obtained either pursuant to a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which provides for a single marketing authorization valid for all E.U. member states, is mandatory for the approval of certain drug products and is optional for novel drug products that are in the interest of patient health. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted for review to the European Medicines Agency, which makes a recommendation on the application to the European Commission, who determines whether or not to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for concurrent mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.The E.U. has also adopted directives and other laws that govern the labeling, marketing, advertising, supply, distribution and drug safety monitoring and reporting of drug products. Such directives set regulatory standards throughout the E.U. and permit member states to supplement such standards with additional requirements.European governments also regulate drug prices through the control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of such costs to patients. Many regulate the pricing of a new drug product at launch through direct price controls or reference pricing and, recently, some have also imposed additional cost-containment measures on drug products. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between E.U. member states. Many European governments also advocate generic substitution by requiring or permitting prescribers or pharmacists to substitute a different company's generic version of a brand drug product that was prescribed, and patients are unlikely to take a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government.Japan. The Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency ("PMDA") is responsible for reviewing marketing authorizations of drug products. The PMDA may require bridging studies (a clinical trial with a smaller sub-population than the original clinical trials) to demonstrate that clinical trial data obtained in trials conducted outside of Japan are applicable to Japanese patients. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports its findings to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which either approves or denies the application.Japan's national health insurance system maintains a Drug Price List that specifies which drug products are eligible for reimbursement and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets pricing for such drug products. In general, the Japanese government introduces a round of price cuts every other year and mandates price reductions for specific drug products. However, new drug products that are judged innovative or useful, indicated for pediatric use, or target orphan diseases may be eligible for premium prices. Similar to other countries, the Japanese government also advocates the prescribing and use of generic drugs, where available.Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets continue to evolve their regulatory review and oversight processes. At present, such countries typically require prior regulatory approval or marketing authorization from large, developed markets (such as the U.S.) before they will initiate or complete their review. Some countries also require the applicant to conduct local clinical trials as a condition of marketing authorization. Many emerging markets continue to implement measures to control drug product prices, such as implementing direct price controls or advocating the prescribing and use of generic drugs.EnvironmentalOur operations, like those of other pharmaceutical companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing processes and, as such, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be in full compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at all times. Certain environmental laws assess strict (i.e., can be imposed regardless of fault) and joint and several liability on current or previous owners of real property and current or previous owners or operators of facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. We have, from time to time, received notification from the EPA and from state environmental agencies in the U.S. that conditions at a number of sites where the disposal of hazardous substances requires investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial actions. These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the cost of investigation and cleanup of these sites including compensation for damage to natural resources. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations, as further described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 18 to Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and generally have become more stringent over time. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and to address liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances. However, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 20Further, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental matters, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs that, in management's opinion, are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but could be material to the results of operations in any one accounting period.Certain radiological licenses at certain manufacturing sites owned by us require the establishment of decommissioning programs which will require remediation in accordance with regulatory requirements upon cessation of operations at these sites.Raw MaterialsWe contract with various third-party manufacturers and suppliers to provide us with raw materials used in our products, finished goods and certain services. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required for our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The active ingredients in the majority of our current pharmaceutical products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl, methylphenidate and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation and the DEA limits both the availability of these active ingredients and the production of these products. As discussed in "Regulatory Matters" within this Item 1. Business, we must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain and produce these substances. The DEA has complete discretion to adjust these quotas from time to time during the calendar year and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to conduct bioequivalence studies and clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in granting, in whole or in part, our quota requests for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of the manufacture of our pharmaceutical products, our clinical trials or product launches and could require us to allocate product among our customers.Our radiopharmaceutical product offering includes "hot" radioisotopes including Mo-99, a critical ingredient of our Ultra-Technekow DTE Tc-99m generators. Mo-99 is produced in nuclear research reactors utilizing HEU or LEU targets. These targets, either tubular or flat and of varying sizes, are fabricated from HEU or LEU and, in either case, aluminum. The targets are placed in or near the core of the nuclear reactor where fission reactions occur resulting in the production of Mo-99 and other isotopes. This process, which takes approximately six days, is known as target irradiation. There are currently eight reactors around the world producing the global supply of Mo-99. We have agreements to obtain Mo-99 from three of these reactors and we rely predominantly on two of these reactors for our Mo-99 supply. These reactors are subject to scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns which can have a significant impact on the amount of Mo-99 available for processing. Mo-99 produced at these reactors is then finished at one of five processing sites located throughout the world, including our processing facility located in the Netherlands. At the processing facility, the targets are dissolved and chemically separated. In this process, the Mo-99 is isolated as a radiochemical. We transport finished Mo-99 from our processing facility in the Netherlands to our facility in Maryland Heights, Missouri, where it, together with Mo-99 received from other third-party processors, is loaded into our Tc-99m generators. Mo-99 has a 66 hour half-life and degrades into, among other things, Tc-99m, which has a half-life of only six hours. The radiopharmacies or hospitals prepare dosages from the Tc-99m generators for use in SPECT imaging medical procedures.In November 2012, the High Flux Reactor ("HFR") in the Netherlands, one of two primary reactors we utilize, experienced an unscheduled shutdown. We were able to receive increased target irradiations at the two other reactors and purchased additional Mo-99 from other sources to continue meeting customer orders; however, the additional Mo-99 we procured from alternative sources came at a higher than normal cost. The HFR resumed production in June 2013. In October 2013, the HFR experienced another unscheduled shutdown. In addition, our own Mo-99 processing facility in the Netherlands also experienced a shutdown. Until these facilities resume normal production, we expect to fulfill customer orders through procurement of Mo-99 from alternative sources at higher than historical costs. Ongoing increased raw material and manufacturing costs will limit our ability to return the Global Medical Imaging segment to historical operating margins.Sales, Marketing and CustomersSales and MarketingWe market our branded, generic and CMDS products to physicians, pharmacists, pharmacy buyers, radiologists and radiology technicians. We distribute these products to major drug wholesalers, retail pharmacy chains, hospital networks and governmental agencies. In addition, we contract with GPOs and managed care organizations to improve access to our products. We sell and distribute API directly or through distributors to other pharmaceutical companies. In the U.S., we market and distribute our nuclear imaging products to radiopharmacies which, in turn, supply hospitals and standalone imaging centers with patient-customized doses. Outside the U.S., we market and distribute our nuclear imaging products to hospitals. 21We often negotiate with parties that enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities, including GPOs, integrated delivery networks, large and medium size retail pharmacy chains, nuclear pharmacy chains, wholesalers and, solely outside the U.S., with governments through a tender process. For further information on our sales and marketing strategies, refer to "Our Businesses and Product Strategies" included within this Item 1. Business.CustomersNet sales to distributors that accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011Cardinal Health, Inc.18% 19% 19%McKesson Corporation15% 14% 13%Amerisource Bergen Corporation9% 9% 10%No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the past three fiscal years.Manufacturing and DistributionWe presently have ten manufacturing sites, including seven located in the U.S., as well as sites in Canada, Ireland and the Netherlands, which handle production, assembly, quality assurance testing, packaging and sterilization of our products. We estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2013 (as measured by cost of production) was as follows:U.S.79%Europe13%Canada8%We maintain distribution centers in 17 countries. In addition, in certain countries outside the U.S. we utilize third-party distribution centers. Products generally are delivered to these distribution centers from our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, product, such as nuclear medicine, is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products by road, rail, sea and air.BacklogAt September 27, 2013, the backlog of firm orders was less than 1% of net sales. We anticipate that substantially all of the backlog as of September 27, 2013 will be shipped during fiscal 2014.SeasonalityThere are no significant seasonal aspects to our business; however, DEA quotas are allocated in each calendar year to companies and may impact our sales until the DEA grants additional quotas, if any. Impacts from quota limitations are most commonly experienced during the third and fourth calendar quarters, which represent our fourth and first fiscal quarters, respectively.EmployeesAt September 27, 2013, we had approximately 5,500 employees, approximately 4,100 of which are based in the U.S. Certain of these employees are represented by unions or work councils. We believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees, and with the unions and work councils that represent certain employees.22Executive OfficersSet forth below are the names, ages as of December 1, 2013, and current positions of our executive officers.NameAgeTitleMark Trudeau52President, Chief Executive Officer and DirectorMatthew Harbaugh43Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPeter Edwards52Senior Vice President and General CounselHugh O'Neill50Senior Vice President and President of Specialty PharmaceuticalsStephen Merrick53Senior Vice President and President, Commercial Operations, InternationalGary Phillips47Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy OfficerMario Saltarelli53Senior Vice President and Chief Science OfficerIan Watkins51Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources OfficerMeredith Fischer60Senior Vice President, Communications and Public AffairsSet forth below is a brief description of the position and business experience of each of our executive officers.Mark Trudeau is our President and Chief Executive Officer, and also serves on our board of directors.

Our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Risks Related to Our BusinessWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The DEA regulates the availability of controlled substances that are API, drug products under development and marketed drug products. At times, the procurement and manufacturing quotas granted by the DEA may be insufficient to meet our commercial and R&D needs.The U.S. DEA is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the CSA. The CSA classifies drugs and other substances based on identified potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances, such as heroin and LSD, have a high abuse potential and have no currently accepted medical use; thus, they cannot be lawfully marketed or sold. Schedule II or III controlled substances include molecules such as oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone and methylphenidate. 24The manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of these controlled substances are permitted, but highly regulated. The DEA regulates the availability of API, products under development and marketed drug products that are Schedule II or III by setting annual quotas. Every year, we must apply to the DEA for manufacturing quota to manufacture API and procurement quota to manufacture finished dosage products. Given that the DEA has discretion to grant or deny our manufacturing and procurement quota requests, the quota the DEA grants may be insufficient to meet our commercial and R&D needs. To date in calendar 2013, manufacturing and procurement quotas granted by the DEA have been sufficient to meet our sales and inventory requirements on most products. During calendar 2012, the initial hydrocodone manufacturing and procurement quota grants we received from the DEA were below the amounts requested and were therefore insufficient to meet customer demand. While we were granted additional quota, these shortfalls did result in lost sales of hydrocodone products, the amount of which was not significant. Future delay or refusal by the DEA to grant, in whole or in part, our quota requests could delay or result in stopping the manufacture of our marketed drug products, new product launches or the conduct of bioequivalence studies and clinical trials. Such delay or refusal also could require us to allocate marketed drug products among our customers. These factors, along with any delay or refusal by the DEA to provide customers who purchase API from us with sufficient quota, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, and our business could suffer if we, or our suppliers, encounter manufacturing or supply problems.The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory and manufacturing requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors. If a batch of finished product fails to meet quality standards during a production run, then that entire batch of product may have to be discarded. These problems could lead to backorders, increased costs (including contractual damages for failure to meet supply requirements), lost revenue, damage to customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating, correcting and preventing the root causes and, depending on the root causes, similar losses with respect to other products. In fiscal 2012, we experienced disruptions in supplying products to our customers due to a number of factors, including mechanical, capacity and packaging quality control issues and the implementation of a new production planning system at our Hobart, New York manufacturing facility. These issues resulted in higher than usual backorders and obligations to pay contractual damages for failure to meet supply requirements. During fiscal 2012, our Generics business incurred approximately $13 million of expenses for such contractual damages, a substantial portion of which was attributable to the issues experienced at this facility. We did not experience material expenses in fiscal 2013 related to manufacturing problems. In the event that manufacturing problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we also could incur product recall and product liability costs. If we incur a product recall or product liability costs involving one of our products, such product could receive reduced market acceptance and thus reduced product demand and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. Significant manufacturing problems could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global supply of fission-produced Mo-99 is limited. Our inability to obtain and/or to timely transport Mo-99 to our Tc-99m generator production facilities could prevent us from delivering our Ultra-Technekow DTE Tc-99m generators to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframe, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues or increased costs if we procure supply from other sources.Mo-99 is a critical ingredient of our Tc-99m generators. Mo-99 is produced in nuclear research reactors utilizing HEU or LEU targets. These targets, either tubular or flat and of varying sizes, are fabricated from HEU or LEU and, in either case, aluminum. The targets are placed in or near the core of the nuclear reactor where fission reactions occur resulting in the production of Mo-99 and other isotopes. This process, which takes approximately six days, is known as target irradiation. There are currently eight reactors around the world producing the global supply of Mo-99. We have agreements to obtain Mo-99 from three of these reactors and we rely predominantly on two of these reactors for our Mo-99 supply. These reactors are subject to scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns which can have a significant impact on the amount of Mo-99 available for processing. Mo-99 produced at these reactors is then finished at one of five processing sites located throughout the world, including our processing facility located in the Netherlands. At the processing facility, the targets are dissolved and chemically separated. In this process, the Mo-99 is isolated as a radiochemical. Once finished, Mo-99 must be transported to generator facilities where it is loaded into our Tc-99m generators that are sold, in the U.S., principally to nuclear radiopharmacies as well as hospitals and, in Europe and other markets, principally to hospitals, where single unit doses are then prepared. Mo-99 has a 66-hour half-life and decays primarily into Tc-99m, which has a half-life of only six hours. The radiopharmacies or hospitals prepare dosages from the Tc-99m generators for use in SPECT imaging medical procedures. Given the product's radioactive decay, if we encounter delays in transporting Mo-99 to our generator facilities, or if the generator facilities experience delays in loading Mo-99, we may be limited in the amount of Ultra-Technekow DTE generators that we could manufacture, distribute and sell, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.25In November 2012, the HFR in the Netherlands, one of two primary reactors we utilize, experienced an unscheduled shutdown. We were able to receive increased target irradiations at the two other reactors and purchased additional Mo-99 from other sources to continue meeting customer orders; however, the additional Mo-99 we procured from alternative sources came at a higher than normal cost. The reactor resumed production in June 2013. In October 2013, the HFR experienced another unscheduled shutdown. In addition, our own Mo-99 processing facility in the Netherlands also experienced a shutdown. Until these facilities resume normal production, we expect to fulfill customer orders through procurement of Mo-99 from alternative sources at higher than historical costs. Future unplanned shutdowns of nuclear reactors that we use to irradiate targets could impact the amount of available Mo-99, which could result in global shortages, continued increased raw material costs and decreased sales. While we are pursuing additional sources of Mo-99 from potential producers around the world to augment our current supply, it is not certain whether these possible additional sources of Mo-99 will produce commercial quantities of Mo-99 for our business, or that these suppliers, together with our current suppliers, will be able to deliver a sufficient quantity of Mo-99 to meet our needs. Ongoing increased raw material and manufacturing costs will limit our ability to return the Global Medical Imaging segment to historical operating margins.In response to the U.S. National Security Administration's Global Threat Initiative, we are in the process of converting our Mo-99 production operation in the Netherlands from HEU targets to LEU targets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing this conversion.We currently use HEU targets for the production of Mo-99. In 2004, the U.S. National Security Administration established its Global Threat Initiative to, as quickly as possible, identify, secure and remove or facilitate the disposition of vulnerable, high-risk nuclear and radiological materials around the world. Included as one of the stated initiatives is the conversion by research reactors and isotope production facilities to LEU from HEU. We are in the process of converting our Mo-99 production operation in the Netherlands to LEU targets. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing the conversion. If we are successful in converting to LEU targets, we expect that the manufacturing costs will be higher than those incurred while utilizing HEU targets, which may negatively impact the profitability of our Global Medical Imaging segment.Our customer concentration may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We primarily sell our products to a limited number of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains. In turn, these wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains supply products to pharmacies, hospitals, governmental agencies and physicians. Sales to two of our distributors that supply our products to many end user customers, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, each accounted for 10% or more of our total net sales in each of the past three fiscal years. Additionally, AmerisourceBergen Corporation accounted for 10% of our total net sales in fiscal 2011. If we were to lose the business of these distributors, or if these distributors were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Cost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations could materially adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.In an effort to reduce cost, many existing and potential customers for our products within the U.S. have become members of GPOs and integrated delivery networks ("IDNs"). GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain contracts with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability. While having a contract with a GPO or IDN for a given product can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, having a contract is no assurance that sales volume of those products will be maintained. GPOs and IDNs increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for a certain product, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days prior notice. Accordingly, although we have contracts with many major GPOs and IDNs, the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors, which could result in a decline in our net sales and results of operations.26Distributors of our products are negotiating terms of sale more aggressively in an effort to increase their profitability. Failure to negotiate distribution arrangements having advantageous pricing and other terms of sale could cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Outside the U.S., we have experienced pricing pressure due to the concentration of purchasing power in centralized governmental healthcare authorities and increased efforts by such authorities to lower healthcare costs. We frequently are required to engage in competitive bidding for the sale of our products to governmental purchasing agents. Our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could materially adversely affect our net sales and results of operations in these markets.We may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products or adapt to a changing technology and diagnostic treatment landscape and, as a result, our results of operations may suffer.Our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products, including:•developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory and quality standards in a timely manner;•receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner, or at all;•the availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including API and other key ingredients;•developing and commercializing a new product is time-consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors, including legal actions brought by our competitors, that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of new products;•unanticipated costs;•payment of prescription drug user fees to the FDA to defray the costs of review and approval of marketing applications for branded and generic drugs;•experiencing delays as a result of limited resources at the FDA or other regulatory authorities;•changing review and approval policies and standards at the FDA or other regulatory authorities; •potential delay in the commercializing of generic products by up to 30 months resulting from the listing of patents with the FDA; and•effective execution of the planned launch in a manner that is consistent with anticipated costs.As a result of these and other difficulties, products currently in development by us may or may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or approvals at all, as to one or more dosage strengths. This risk particularly exists with respect to the development of proprietary products due to the uncertainties, higher costs and length of time associated with R&D of such products and the inherent unproven market acceptance of such products. In addition, we face heightened risks in connection with our development of extended-release products because of the technical complexities and evolving regulatory and quality requirements related to such products. Moreover, the FDA regulates the facilities, processes and procedures used to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Manufacturing facilities must be registered with the FDA and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA. Compliance with cGMP regulations requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant expenditures. The FDA periodically inspects both our facilities and procedures to ensure compliance. The FDA may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug is required by the FDA to curtail or cease operations, or otherwise becomes inoperable, obtaining the required FDA authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.With respect to generic products for which we are the first developer to have its application accepted for filing by the FDA, and which filing includes a certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed (known as a "Paragraph IV certification"), our ability to obtain and realize the full benefits of 180-days of market exclusivity is dependent upon a number of factors, including, for example, being the first to file, the status of any litigation that might be brought against us as a result of our filing or our not meeting regulatory, manufacturing or quality requirements or standards. If any of our products are not timely approved, or if we are unable to obtain and realize the full benefits of the 180-day market exclusivity period for our products, or if our products cannot be successfully manufactured or timely commercialized, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products.27Also, new products, including contrast agents, are being developed and existing products are being refined in the field of diagnostic imaging. Our own diagnostic imaging agents compete not only with other similarly administrated imaging agents, but also with imaging agents employed in different and often competing diagnostic modalities. New imaging agents in a given diagnostic modality may be developed that provide benefits superior to the then-dominant agent in that modality, resulting in commercial displacement. Similarly, changing perceptions about comparative efficacy and safety, including, among other things, with respect to comparative radiation exposure, and changing availability of supply may favor one agent over another or one modality over another.We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or we may be subject to claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, market exclusivity gained from the regulatory approval process and other intellectual property to support our business strategy. However, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.Our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents, or the patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors. Existing patents may be found to be invalid or insufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from using methods or making or selling products similar or identical to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Regulatory agencies may refuse to grant us the market exclusivity that we were anticipating, or may unexpectedly grant market exclusivity rights to other parties. In addition, our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights is limited by the unique laws of each country. In some countries it may be particularly difficult to adequately obtain or enforce intellectual property rights, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in such countries by utilizing technologies and product features that are similar or identical to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our patents. Competitors may diminish the value of our trade secrets by reverse engineering or by independent invention. Additionally, current or former employees may improperly disclose such trade secrets to competitors or other third parties. We may not become aware of any such improper disclosure, and, in the event we do become aware, we may not have an adequate remedy available to us.We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation, and we may from time to time be a party to such litigation. In Tyco Healthcare Group LP, et al. v. Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc., we filed a patent infringement suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., et al. (collectively, "Mutual") on March 20, 2007 pursuant to procedures set out in the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, after Mutual submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking to sell a generic version of our 7.5 mg Restoril sleep aid product. Mutual also filed antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims. The patents at issue have since expired or been found invalid. On January 18, 2013, the trial court issued an opinion and order granting our motion for summary judgment regarding Mutual's antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims. On May 1, 2013, Mutual appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.The pursuit of or defense against patent infringement, such as the case discussed above, is costly and time-consuming and we may not know the outcomes of such litigation for protracted periods of time. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, patent litigation can result in significant damage awards, including the possibility of treble damages and injunctions. Additionally, we could be forced to stop manufacturing and selling certain products, or we may need to enter into license agreements that require us to make significant royalty or up-front payments in order to continue selling the affected products. Given the nature of our industry, we are likely to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We face significant competition and may not be able to compete effectively.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition takes many forms, such as price reductions on products that are comparable to our own, development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products that may be more cost-effective than or have performance superior to our products, and the introduction of generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection or market exclusivity. For further discussion on the competitive nature of our business, as well as intellectual property rights and market exclusivity, refer to Item 1. Business included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of this competition. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.28Any acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses may be difficult to integrate, could materially adversely affect our relationships with key customers and/or could result in significant impairment charges.We regularly review potential acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses complementary to our business. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating operations, personnel, technologies and products. If we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, we may not obtain the advantages and synergies that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, the due diligence that we conduct in conjunction with an acquisition may not sufficiently discover risks and contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition target and, consequently, we may consummate an acquisition for which the risks and contingent liabilities are greater than were projected. In addition, in connection with acquisitions, we could experience disruption in our business, technology and information systems, and our customer or employee base, including diversion of management's attention from our continuing operations. There is also a risk that key employees of companies that we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize technologies and products that we acquire may seek employment elsewhere, including with our competitors. Furthermore, there may be overlap between our products or customers and the companies which we acquire that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. Additionally, the time between our expenditures to acquire new products, technologies or businesses and the subsequent generation of revenues from those acquired products, technologies or businesses (or the timing of revenue recognition related to licensing agreements and/or strategic collaborations) could cause fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period. Finally, if we are unable to successfully integrate products, technologies, businesses or personnel that we acquire, we could incur significant impairment charges or other adverse financial consequences.We may incur product liability losses and other litigation liability.We are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries and investigations, including, but not limited to, patent infringement, product liability, antitrust matters, breach of contract, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements claims, or compliance with laws relating to marketing and sales or controlled substance distribution practices, including those relating to the establishment of SOM programs. Such proceedings, inquiries and investigations may involve claims for, or the possibility of fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties and exclusion from participation in various government healthcare-related programs. If any of these legal proceedings, inquiries or investigations were to result in an adverse outcome, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.With respect to product liability and clinical trial risks, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our marketed products or products in development have caused, or could cause, serious adverse events or other injury. Any such claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in an increase in our insurance premiums. We retain liability for the first $2.5 million per claim and purchase, through a combination of primary and umbrella/excess liability policies, $150 million of coverage beyond the retained liabilities. We believe this coverage level is adequate to meet our current business exposure. However, some claims brought against us might not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, where the claim is covered by our insurance, if our insurance coverage is inadequate, we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. We may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all since insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain. Our failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage or successfully defend against product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The implementation of healthcare reform in the U.S. may materially adversely affect us.In March 2010, the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted into law in the U.S. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and the medical imaging procedures in which our drug products are used. For example, the Healthcare Reform Act includes a provision that imposes a $28 billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years, starting in 2011, and a $2.8 billion annual fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry thereafter. To the extent that the market share of our Brands business grows, the portion of this fee that we will be obligated to pay will increase.There can be no assurance that the Healthcare Reform Act as currently enacted, and when fully implemented, will not materially adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, nor can we predict with certainty how federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare will affect our business.29Sales of our products are affected by the reimbursement practices of a small number of large public and private insurers. In addition, reimbursement criteria and the use of tender systems outside the U.S. could reduce prices for our products or reduce our market opportunities.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are reimbursed by governmental health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Our potential customers' ability to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from these third-party payors affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. In addition, demand for new products may be limited unless we obtain reimbursement approval from governmental and private third-party payors prior to introduction. Reimbursement criteria, which vary by country, are becoming increasingly stringent and require management expertise and significant attention to obtain and maintain qualification for reimbursement.In addition, a number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for products. The company that wins the tender receives preferential reimbursement for a period of time. Accordingly, the tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. Certain other countries may consider implementation of a tender system. Even if a tender system is ultimately not implemented, the anticipation of such could result in price reductions. Failing to win tenders, or the implementation of similar systems in other markets leading to price declines, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, are complex. Any determination of failure to comply with these obligations or those relating to healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs, and rebates and other governmental programs, are complex. Because our processes for these calculations and the judgments used in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in material adjustments to amounts previously paid.Any governmental agencies that have commenced, or may commence, an investigation of Mallinckrodt relating to the sales, marketing, pricing, quality or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose, based on a claim of violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments, and even in the absence of any such ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions. For example, from time to time states attorneys general have brought cases against us that allege generally that we and numerous other pharmaceuticals companies reported false pricing information in connection with certain drugs that are reimbursable under Medicaid, resulting in overpayment by state Medicaid programs for those drugs, and generally seek monetary damages and attorneys' fees. For example, we are named as a defendant in State of Utah v. Actavis US, Inc., et al., filed May 8, 2008, which is pending in the Third Judicial Circuit of Salt Lake County, Utah. While we intend to contest this case and explore other options as appropriate, any such penalties or sanctions that we might receive in this or other actions could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in laws and regulations may materially adversely affect us.The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Changes in laws and regulations could affect us in various ways. For example, both the federal and state governments have given increased attention to the public health issue of opioid abuse, overdose and diversion. At the federal level, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy continues to coordinate efforts between the FDA, DEA and other agencies to address this problem. In January 2013, the FDA released draft guidance on incorporating abuse-deterrent characteristics into extended-release opioids. When the FDA finds that a new formulation has abuse-deterrent characteristics, the agency has the authority to require that generics also have abuse-deterrent characteristics. One of our ANDAs that is currently under review in the U.S. refers to a NDA that did not have abuse-deterrent characteristics. From a compliance standpoint, the DEA continues to increase its efforts to hold manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies accountable through various enforcement actions as well as the implementation of compliance practices for controlled substances, including SOM activities for Schedule II opioids. In addition, many state legislatures continue to consider various bills intended to reduce opioid abuse, overdose and diversion, for example by establishing prescription drug monitoring programs, mandating prescriber education and prohibiting the substitution of generic versions of opioids that lack abuse-deterrent characteristics for branded products that have them. Future legislation and regulation in the markets that we serve 30could affect access to healthcare products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, change healthcare delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. These and other changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In October 2013, the FDA announced its recommendation that the DEA reschedule hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin and our developmental product MNK-155) from Schedule III to Schedule II, thereby increasing regulatory controls on these drug products. The FDA expects to issue its formal recommendation to the DHHS in December 2013. This recommendation will begin a process that will lead to a final decision by the DEA on the scheduling of these products. At this time, it is too early to determine the degree of impact the hydrocodone rescheduling, if adopted, will have on our business. Global economic conditions could harm us.Over the course of the last few years, global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging, with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession (including concerns that certain European countries may default on payments due on their national debt), energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished growth expectations for developed and developing economies. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have resulted in a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in consumer spending may materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition as well as our share price.Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We operate globally with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, Australia and North America. We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be violated, for example inadvertently or through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our results of operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and prevent or mitigate these risks and manage difficulties as they arise.In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:•longer payment cycles in countries like Spain and Italy and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain non-U.S. legal systems;•political and economic instability, including, most notably, the risks and uncertainty associated with the current concerns regarding the stability of the Eurozone and the related possibility of sovereign defaults in countries such as Spain and Italy, and the possibility that such a default or the exit of one or more member countries from the Eurozone or from the E.U. entirely may lead to difficulties for other members of the E.U.;•potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and trade barriers; and•failure to successfully implement our new non-U.S. operating structure, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations. These or other factors or any combination of them may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.31Currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.We do business and generate sales in numerous countries outside the U.S. As such, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in such international operations. Some of our operating expenses are incurred in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in those countries where we have operations could increase our costs and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We also have significant intercompany financing arrangements that may result in gains and losses in our results of operations. In an effort to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate effects we may hedge certain of these intercompany transactions; however, our hedging strategies may not fully offset gains and losses recognized in our results of operations. In addition, we report our operating results in U.S. dollars, so the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to such other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations expose us to the risk of material health, safety and environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:•the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;•emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;•investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;•chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal, mandatory recycling and take-back programs; and•the health and safety of our employees. We may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in full compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not in full compliance with these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Environmental laws are becoming more stringent, including outside the U.S., resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property and current or previous owners or operators of facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive, strict (i.e., can be imposed regardless of fault) and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. Certain radiological licenses at certain manufacturing sites owned by us require the establishment of decommissioning programs which will require remediation in accordance with regulatory requirements upon cessation of operations at such sites. We have received notification from the EPA and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where the disposal of hazardous substances requires investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial action. These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites, including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims arising from such sites.In the ordinary course of our business planning process, we take into account our known environmental matters as we plan for our future capital and operating expenditures requirements. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. We concluded that, as of September 27, 2013, it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of $46.4 million to $81.5 million. We also concluded that, as of September 27, 2013, the best estimate within this range was $46.4 million. For further information on our environmental obligations, refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon information known to date, we believe our current capital and operating plans are adequate for costs associated with the investigation, cleanup and potential remedial action for our known environmental matters.While we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental laws, our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.32If we are unable to retain our key personnel, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical, regulatory and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical, regulatory and commercial personnel, or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical, regulatory and commercial personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.Our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information technology infrastructure, and failures of this infrastructure could harm our operations.To remain competitive in our industry, we must employ information technologies to support manufacturing processes, quality processes, distribution, R&D and regulatory applications that capture, manage and analyze, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, the large streams of data generated in our clinical trials. We rely extensively on technology to allow concurrent work sharing around the world. As with all information technology, our systems are vulnerable to potential damage or interruptions from fires, blackouts, telecommunications failures and other unexpected events, as well as physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage, piracy or intentional acts of vandalism. Given the extensive reliance of our business on technology, any substantial disruption or resulting loss of data that is not avoided or corrected by our backup measures could harm our business, operations and financial condition.We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring activities and our restructuring activities may adversely affect our business.From time to time, we initiate restructuring programs as we continue to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and look for opportunities to achieve operating efficiencies that will reduce costs. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated when we launched our restructuring programs. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring activities we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganizations and restructurings can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to the SeparationThe following discussion highlights some of the risks we face as a result of the Separation. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We have not operated as an independent company for a significant period of time, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved had we been an independent, publicly-traded company for the entirety of the periods presented, and may not be an accurate indicator of our future results of operations.Historical information about Mallinckrodt for periods prior to the Separation reflects the results of the Pharmaceuticals business of Covidien, as operated by and integrated with Covidien, and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Covidien. Accordingly, this historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the entirety of the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future for various factors, including those described below.•Our business had historically been operated by Covidien as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company, particularly in relation to our non-U.S. locations. Covidien or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as accounting, information technology and finance. Covidien will continue to provide some of these functions to us for a period of time pursuant to a transition services agreement. Our historical financial results for periods prior to the Separation include allocations of corporate expenses from Covidien for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we will incur operating as an independent, publicly-traded company.•We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of being an independent, publicly-traded company including, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, reporting fees with the SEC, New York Stock Exchange listing fees, transfer agent fees, increased auditing and legal fees. These expenses may be significant and may negatively impact our results of operations as compared to periods prior to the Separation.33•Our financial results for periods prior to the Separation include costs incurred to separate Mallinckrodt from Covidien, which primarily related to legal, accounting, tax and other professional fees. We continue to incur separation related costs as a result of our transition services agreement with Covidien, as well as other transitional costs, such as costs to implement our own information and accounting systems. Our future separation related costs may fluctuate based on the nature and timing of our separation activities.•We will need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure and personnel that were formerly available to us through Covidien. The initiatives to develop our independent operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement, and we may not be able to operate our business efficiently or at comparable costs, which may cause our profitability to decline.•Prior to the Separation, our working capital and capital for our general corporate purposes had been provided as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Covidien. In the future, we may need to obtain additional financing from lenders, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.•The cost of debt or equity capital for our business may be significantly different than that of Covidien.•Prior to the Separation, we were able to use Covidien's purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and had shared economies of scope and scale in vendor relationships. As a standalone company, we may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the Separation, which could decrease our overall profitability. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Covidien. Additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined financial statements is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.As we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.We continue to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support our critical business functions, particularly in relation to areas outside the U.S., including systems relating to accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. We may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively from Covidien's existing transactional and operational systems and data centers and the transition services that support these functions as we replace these systems. We may not be successful in effectively and efficiently implementing our new systems and transitioning our data, and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Our failure to avoid operational interruptions as we implement the new systems and replace Covidien's information technology services, or our failure to implement the new systems and replace Covidien's services effectively and efficiently, could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If we are unable to satisfy our reporting requirements or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Prior to the Separation, our financial results were included within the consolidated results of Covidien, and our reporting of internal control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company. Prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10, we were not directly subject to reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act") and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("the Sarbanes-Oxley Act").As an independent, publicly-traded company, we are now subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as other reporting requirements. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports about our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management to report on its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management report on internal controls and our auditors' report are not contained in this report due to a transition period established under SEC rules for newly public companies. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require demands on our management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources. To comply with these requirements we are upgrading our systems, including computer hardware infrastructure, implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and have hired additional accounting, finance and information technology staff. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply 34to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to meet our reporting requirements or achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may have received more favorable or less favorable terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Covidien.We entered into agreements with Covidien in connection with the Separation, including a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. Since such agreements were negotiated in the context of the Separation, the terms of such agreements may be more favorable or less favorable than the terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.Covidien may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation, or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.In connection with the Separation, we entered into various agreements with Covidien, including a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement. For further information on these agreements, refer to Exhibits 2.1, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2013. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the Separation. We will rely on Covidien to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Covidien is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction or long-term agreements terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We continue the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Covidien provided to us prior to the Separation, and is continuing to provide us pursuant to these agreements. These systems and services may be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services Covidien is providing during the transition period.Potential indemnification liabilities to Covidien pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially adversely affect us.The separation and distribution agreement with Covidien provided for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Separation, certain conditions to the distribution and provisions governing the relationship between us and Covidien following the Separation. The separation and distribution agreement was filed with the SEC as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on July 1, 2013. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement will provide for indemnification obligations principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Covidien's remaining business with Covidien, among other indemnities. If we are required to indemnify Covidien under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. These potential indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and the Separation may materially adversely affect our business.We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation was expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) our ability to focus on our own strategic and operational plans and capital structure; (ii) an appropriate capital structure for Mallinckrodt; (iii) a distinct investment identity allowing investors to evaluate the merits, performance and future prospects of us separately from Covidien; and (iv) more effective share-based compensation and currency for acquisitions.We may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) the Separation required significant amounts of management's time and effort, which may have diverted management's attention from operating and growing our business; (b) as an independent, publicly-traded company, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Covidien; (c) our business is less diversified than Covidien's business prior to the Separation; and (d) the continuing actions required to separate Covidien's and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.35Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe have significant indebtedness, which could impact our ability to pay dividends and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position.As of September 27, 2013, we had $919.8 million of total debt. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness may impose restrictions on us that could have material adverse consequences by:•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;•imposing restrictive covenants on our operations;•requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to paying the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes; and•making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures. In connection with the Separation, we incurred a significant amount of debt for which Covidien retained a significant portion of the cash proceeds. As a result, the amount of leverage in our business has significantly increased. This has increased the riskiness of our business and of an investment in our ordinary shares.Our ability to meet expense and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including government regulation, product development, intellectual property matters and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, incur additional debt or issue equity. These actions may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares.Our credit facility bears interest at variable rates and credit spreads. If interest rates or credit spreads increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow if we were to have borrowings outstanding under this facility.The agreements governing our revolving credit facility and senior notes contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.The agreements governing our revolving credit facility and senior notes contain various affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, among other things. In addition, some of our debt agreements contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum performance levels. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.Challenges in the commercial and credit environment may materially adversely affect our ability to issue debt on acceptable terms and our future access to capital.Our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be materially adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, or if other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur. In addition, volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.36We may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable or acceptable terms, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.We may need to seek additional financing for general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in R&D activities or need funds to make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Depending on market conditions, adequate funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms and we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest.Risks Related to Tax MattersIf the distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then Mallinckrodt and Mallinckrodt's shareholders could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.Covidien received a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") ruling substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) certain transactions effected in connection with the Separation qualified as transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ("the Code"), and (ii) the distribution of Mallinckrodt shares qualified as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition to obtaining the IRS ruling, Covidien received a tax opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which relied on the effectiveness of the IRS ruling, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualified as transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code. The IRS ruling and tax opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, certain representations from Covidien and us regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters, and certain undertakings made by Covidien and us. Notwithstanding the IRS ruling and tax opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion that are not covered by the IRS ruling. If the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend to shareholders of Mallinckrodt, who acquired their shares through distribution to Covidien shareholders at the Separation date, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and they could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liability. In addition, Covidien or we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement ("the Tax Matters Agreement") that we entered into with Covidien, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable.We could have significant tax liabilities under the Tax Matters Agreement with Covidien for periods during which our subsidiaries and operations were those of Covidien and of Tyco International Ltd.Our tax returns are subject to examination by various tax authorities, including the IRS. The IRS is examining our U.S. federal income tax returns for periods during which certain of our subsidiaries and operations were those of Covidien. In addition, the IRS continues to examine the U.S. federal income tax returns of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International") for periods during which certain of our subsidiaries and operations were those of Tyco International. Our potential liability under the Tax Matters Agreement with Covidien for any taxes related to periods prior to the Separation (after taking into account certain tax benefits realized by us), including those which are subject to the provisions of the tax sharing agreement by and among Covidien, Tyco International and TE Connectivity Ltd. ("the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement"), is anticipated to be approximately $175 million, which excludes associated tax benefits from such payments, and will be subject to an overall limitation of $200 million, net of any benefits. For further information on the Tax Matters Agreement, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2013.  The resolution of the matters arising during periods in which certain of our subsidiaries and operations were subsidiaries and operations of Covidien will be subject to the provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement. Under this agreement, Covidien will have the right to administer, control and settle, in its sole and absolute discretion, all tax audits that do not relate solely to non-U.S. taxes for periods prior to the Separation that are not covered by the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement. The outcome of any such examination, and any associated litigation which might arise, is uncertain and could result in a significant increase in our liability for taxes arising during these periods, subject to the overall $200 million limitation described above. The timing and outcome of such examination or litigation is highly uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Covidien will agree to provide to us information it receives related to examinations of tax matters for which we may be liable but we will not otherwise be permitted to control or participate in the settlement or defense of such examinations.37The resolution of the matters arising during periods in which certain of our subsidiaries and operations were subsidiaries and operations of Tyco International will be subject to the provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement and the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement. Under the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and TE Connectivity Ltd. are responsible for 42%, 27% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities prior to the 2007 separation of Covidien, Tyco International and TE Connectivity Ltd. We are not a party to the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement. Under the Tax Matters Agreement we will, however, be liable for certain taxes relating to our subsidiaries and operations arising during periods governed by the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement. Although we will be liable to Covidien for certain taxes arising during periods governed by the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement, we will not be liable to Tyco International or TE Connectivity Ltd. under the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement, nor will we share in the receivable that Covidien has from Tyco International or TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition, Covidien will retain all reimbursements from Tyco International or TE Connectivity Ltd. pursuant to the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement, including reimbursements for taxes that are borne by us pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement.Under the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to the separation from Tyco International. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International has appealed certain of the proposed tax adjustments and all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments has been resolved. With respect to the remaining unresolved matter, Tyco International is contesting the adjustments through litigation. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain and could result in a significant increase in our liability for taxes arising during these periods, subject to the overall $200 million limitation described above. While we believe that the amounts recorded as income taxes payable related to these adjustments are adequate, the timing and outcome of such litigation is highly uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Covidien has agreed to provide to us information it receives from Tyco International related to examinations of tax matters for which we may be liable that are governed by the Tyco Tax Sharing Agreement.Examination and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments.We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. It is Covidien's intention to vigorously defend our prior tax returns. However, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations to our global operations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities associated with these returns. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the reserves generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which we are ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may not be able to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate.We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.Risks Related to Our Jurisdiction of IncorporationLegislative action in the U.S. could materially adversely affect us.Legislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim, override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the U.S. imposes on our worldwide operations. Such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate and/or require us to take further action, at potentially significant expense, to seek to preserve our effective tax rate. In addition, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability as an Irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could incur additional tax expense or otherwise incur business detriment.38Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.A judgment obtained against us will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are met: (i) U.S. courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule) and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where however the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive. However, Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the U.S. courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (i) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (ii) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (iii) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (iv) the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain U.S. laws which will not be enforced in Ireland; or (v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Ireland Superior Courts Rules.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.Irish law imposes restrictions on certain aspects of capital management.Irish law allows our shareholders to pre-authorize shares to be issued by our board of directors without further shareholder approval for up to a maximum of five years. Our current authorization will therefore lapse approximately five years after the date of the Separation, June 28, 2013, unless renewed by shareholders, and we cannot guarantee that such renewal will always be approved. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the opt-out that is included in our articles of association, Irish law grants statutory pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash. This opt-out also expires approximately five years after the Separation, unless renewed by further shareholder approval, and we cannot guarantee that such renewal of the opt-out from pre-emptive rights will always be approved. We cannot assure you that these Irish legal restrictions will not interfere with our capital management. Risks Related to Our Ordinary SharesOur share price may fluctuate significantly.The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;•changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the operating and share price performance of comparable companies;•actual or anticipated sales of our ordinary shares;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment in which we operate; and•U.S. and worldwide economic conditions. 39In addition, when the market price of a company's ordinary shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that an active trading market for our ordinary shares will continue to exist.A number of our ordinary shares are eligible for future sale, which may cause our share price to decline.We have approximately 58.0 million of our ordinary shares outstanding as of December 6, 2013. These shares are tradable without restriction or further registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("the Securities Act"), unless the shares are owned by one of our "affiliates," as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Any sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. Those sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity and equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we consider appropriate.Your percentage of ownership in Mallinckrodt may be diluted.Your percentage ownership in Mallinckrodt may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards granted to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, our articles of association entitle our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to cause us to issue preferred shares with such terms as the board of directors may determine. Preferred shares may be preferred as to dividends, rights on a winding up or voting in such manner as our board of directors may resolve. The preferred shares may also be redeemable at the option of the holder of the preferred shares or at the option of us, and may be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any other class or classes of our shares, depending on the terms of such preferred shares. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our ordinary shares. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred shares the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred shares could affect the residual value of our ordinary shares.Pursuant to a rights agreement entered into at the Separation, we issued one preferred share purchase right (collectively, "the Rights") for each outstanding ordinary share to shareholders of record on July 9, 2013. The Rights will not be exercisable until ten days after the public announcement that a person or group has become an "acquiring person" by obtaining beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding ordinary shares of Mallinckrodt. The Rights will expire on June 28, 2014. In the event the Rights are exercised, this may dilute the percentage of ownership of our other shareholders.Certain provisions in our articles of association, among other things, could prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares.Our articles of association contain provisions that could have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices, inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers. These provisions include, amongst others:•provisions of our articles of association which allow our board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan (commonly known as a "poison pill") upon such terms and conditions as the board of directors deems expedient and in the best interests of our company; •a provision of our articles of association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested shareholder, subject to certain exceptions;•rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;•the right of our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, subject to applicable law; and•the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors in certain circumstances.40We believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in the best interests of our company and its shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent. We also will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our ordinary shares in certain circumstances. Also, Irish companies, including us, may only alter their memorandum of association and articles of association with the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the company's shares present and voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company.The agreements that we entered into with Covidien in connection with the Separation generally required Covidien's consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable. Moreover, an acquisition or further issuance of our ordinary shares after the separation could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, even if the distribution and certain related transactions undertaken in connection therewith otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment. Under Section 355(e) of the Code, we or Covidien could incur tax upon certain transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our ordinary shares or Covidien ordinary shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation. Any acquisitions or issuances of our ordinary shares or Covidien ordinary shares within two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Covidien, as applicable, may be able to rebut that presumption. Moreover, under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with Covidien, we will be restricted from engaging in certain transactions within two years of the distribution which potentially could trigger application of Section 355(e) of the Code. During such period, these restrictions may limit the ability that we, or a potential acquirer of us, have to pursue certain strategic transactions that might increase the value of our ordinary shares.Item 1B
