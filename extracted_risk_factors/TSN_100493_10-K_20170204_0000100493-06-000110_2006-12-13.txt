Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included in the Company’s September 30, 2006, Annual Report filed on Form 10-K.

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

 

These risks should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

TYSON FOODS, INC.




Fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and energy, could negatively impact the Company’s earnings. 

 

Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains, live cattle, live swine and ingredients, as well as the selling prices for our products, many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. Corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry, representing roughly 37% of the cost of growing a chicken. As a result, fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients can significantly affect our earnings. The production of feed ingredients is affected by, among other things, weather patterns throughout the world, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as the agricultural policies of the U.S. and foreign governments. 

 

We do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle in the United States; however, our beef facility in Canada has a feed yard that supplies approximately 21% of its live cattle needs. At times in the United States, we raise a small number of cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties; however, most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers. We have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market. We also enter into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily start-up operations at our facilities. The majority of our live swine supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers. We employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are required for
processing. In addition, we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight, and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of Company owned live swine for our own processing needs. Any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase our per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization, which could adversely affect our financial results. 

 

Market demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from global and domestic food processors. 

 

We face competition from other global, national and regional food producers and processors. The factors on which we compete include: 

 





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            price;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            product safety and quality;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            brand identification;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            breadth and depth of the product offering;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            availability of our products;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            customer service; and  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            credit terms.  



 

Demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins, which at times affect demand for our products. 

 

We attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect, in part, the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products.  If we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increase, we may be unable to maintain positive margins.

 

Outbreaks of livestock diseases can significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products. 

 

The demand for our products can be affected significantly by outbreaks of livestock diseases, and such occurrences can have a significant impact on our financial results. Efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock. However, the outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products, consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our 

 

11















TYSON FOODS, INC.




Chicken segment, could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. Furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken, beef or other products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers. This could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results. 

 

H5N1. There has been substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, known as H5N1.  H5N1 has been affecting Asia since 2002 and has been found in other parts of the world as recently as 2006.  It is widely believed H5N1 is spread by migratory birds, such as ducks and geese. There also have been some cases where H5N1 is believed to have passed from birds to humans, as humans came into contact with live birds infected with the disease. Public concerns about H5N1 led, for a period of time, to a reduction in demand and price for our poultry products outside of the United States. Although H5N1 has not yet been identified in North America, there have been outbreaks of other low pathogenic strains of avian influenza in North America, including in the United States in 2002 and 2004 and in Mexico for the past several years that, from time to time, have
impacted our operations. Further, these low pathogenic outbreaks have not generated the same level of concern or received the same level of publicity or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for poultry products in certain countries as that associated with the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. Accordingly, even if the H5N1 strain does not spread to North America, there can be no assurance it will not significantly adversely affect demand for North American produced poultry internationally and/or domestically, and, if it were to spread to North America, it could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations and/or demand for our products, in each case in a manner having a significant adverse effect on our financial results. 

 

BSE. In December 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) had been diagnosed in a Washington State dairy cow. The origin of the animal was subsequently traced to a farm in Canada. Shortly after the announcement, several countries (including Japan and South Korea) closed their borders to the importation of edible beef products from the United States. Responding to the loss of export markets, live cattle prices in the United States declined by approximately 18% during the following week. Also in 2003, the Canadian government announced the first confirmed case of BSE in Canada which led the USDA to close the United States’ border to the import of live Canadian cattle. This reduced the supply of live cattle available for processing at our domestic facilities and contributed to lower facility capacity
utilization. The confirmed case in Canada also led several countries to close their borders to the import of edible beef products from Canada, which affected the international sales of our Lakeside, Alberta, facility. In June 2005, the USDA announced a second confirmed case of BSE in the United States and in March 2006, announced the third confirmed case, furthering uncertainty as to whether or when certain closed markets may reopen, and whether or when existing open markets may close. A number of these countries subsequently reopened their borders to U.S. and Canadian beef; however, some of the countries, including Japan and South Korea, have restrictive conditions which limit the types of product that can be imported. 

 

We are subject to risks associated with our international operations, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries, as well as our operations and assets in such countries. 

 

In fiscal 2006, the Company exported our products to more than 80 countries and incurred a loss before taxes from foreign operations of $36 million.  Our major export markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan.  Our export sales for fiscal 2006 totaled $2.1 billion. In addition, we had approximately $197 million of long-lived assets located in foreign countries, primarily Canada and Mexico, at the end of fiscal 2006. 

 

As a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: 

 





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the import of poultry, beef and pork products, in addition to various import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            the closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of poultry, beef and pork due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling, the Brazilian real and the Chinese yuan;  







    
        
              
        
            -

political and economic conditions;





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            difficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcing remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.  



 

The occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other developing markets could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. 

 

We depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our employees. 

 

We have approximately 107,000 employees, of whom approximately 33,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. Our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions. If we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our operating results. 

 

We depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock. 

 

We contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations. A majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell the livestock to the Company under marketing contracts or on the open market. If we do not attract and maintain contracts with our growers, or maintain marketing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively affected. 

 

If our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls. 

 

Our products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and generic E. coli. These pathogens are found generally in the environment; therefore, there is a risk they, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. These pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing, foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. We have little, if any, control over proper handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls (which may not entirely mitigate the risk of
product liability claims), increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. Any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results. 

 

Our operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. 

 

We are involved on an on-going basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders, employees or injured persons, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could significantly adversely affect our financial results.

Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact the Company’s business and liquidity position. 

 

At September 30, 2006, we had approximately $4.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding.  However, when adjusted for the $750 million short-term investment which the Company had on deposit at September 30, 2006, and was used for the repayment of its $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006, the Company’s net debt position at September 30, 2006, was $3.2 billion.  The Company had a borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion, consisting of $481 million available under our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $591 million under our accounts receivable securitization program at September 30, 2006. We expect our indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit agreements, may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. Our consolidated indebtedness level could significantly affect our
business because: 

 





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            it may significantly limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            a downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes, which amount would increase if prevailing interest rates rise; and  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            it may restrict our ability to pay dividends.  



 

In addition, our debt agreements require us to meet specified financial ratios and limit our ability to enter into various transactions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will meet those ratios.  If we default on any of our indebtedness, or if we are unable to obtain necessary liquidity, our indebtedness would be due and payable immediately, and our business could be significantly adversely affected. 

 

Domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs. 

 

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising and labeling of our products. Our facilities for processing chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, and to the health and safety of our employees. Our chicken, beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the government’s Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program and are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. In addition, our chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products are subject
to inspection prior to distribution, primarily by the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and accounting standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. 

 

A material acquisition could affect our operations and financial condition. 

 

We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies, processing plants, technologies, products and services from others, which could include material acquisitions. A material acquisition may involve a number of risks, including: 

 





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating acquisitions and integrating the businesses acquired;  







    
        
              
        
            - 
        
             
   



 

14















TYSON FOODS, INC.




exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and





    
        
              
        
            - 
        
            the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any acquisition which, if obtained, could significantly affect our various financial ratios.  



 

We may not be able to address these problems and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units of our company. If we are unable to do this, expansion could adversely affect our financial results. 

 

Market fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results as we hedge certain transactions. 

 

Our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions, and we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. These positions are marked to fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Therefore, losses on these contracts adversely affect our reported operating results if commodity prices are decreasing.  Although these hedges protect us from upward movements in prices for commodity products, the use of such instruments may limit our ability to participate in cost savings from declining commodity prices. 

 

Deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact the Company’s business. 

 

Our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could significantly adversely affect the demand for our beef, poultry and pork products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby adversely affecting our financial results. 

 

Changes in consumer preference could negatively impact the Company’s business. 

 

The food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our products, and could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 

 

The loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact the Company’s business. 

 

Our business could suffer significant set backs in revenues and operating income if our customers’ plans and/or markets should change significantly, or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 12.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2006. Many of our agreements with our customers are generally short-term, primarily due to the nature of our products, industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products. 

 

Extreme weather or natural disasters could negatively impact the Company’s business. 

 

Extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

TYSON FOODS, INC.




Members of the Tyson family can exercise significant control. 

 

Members of the Tyson family beneficially own, in the aggregate, 99.97% of our outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. $0.10 par value (Class B stock) and 1.50% of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.10 par value (Class A stock), giving them control of approximately 75.06% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, three members of the Tyson family serve on our Board of Directors. As a result, members of the Tyson family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may
also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price. Additionally, as a result of the Tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange; therefore, we have elected not to implement rules that provide for a majority of independent directors, or a nominating committee to identify and recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. Pursuant to these exemptions, our compensation committee, which is made up of independent directors, does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer.
