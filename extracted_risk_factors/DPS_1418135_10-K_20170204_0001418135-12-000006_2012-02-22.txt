, "Risk Factors" under "Risks Related to Our Business" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.iiTable of ContentsPART IITEM 1.   BUSINESS Our CompanyDr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. is a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the United States ("U.S."), Canada and Mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) carbonated soft drinks ("CSDs") and non-carbonated beverages ("NCBs"), including ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks and mixers. We have some of the most recognized beverage brands in North America, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we", "our", "us", "DPS" or "the Company" refer to Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.The following provides highlights about our company:•#1 flavored CSD company in the U.S.•Approximately 84% of our volume from brands that are either #1 or #2 in their category•#3 North American liquid refreshment beverage ("LRB") business•$5.9 billion of net sales in 2011 from the U.S. (89%), Canada (4%) and Mexico and the Caribbean (7%)History of Our BusinessWe have built our business over the last three decades through a series of strategic acquisitions. In the 1980's through the mid-1990’s, we began building on our then existing Schweppes business by adding brands such as Mott's, Canada Dry and A&W and a license for Sunkist soda. We also acquired the Peñafiel business in Mexico. In 1995, we acquired Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., having previously made minority investments in the company. In 1999, we acquired a 40% interest in Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, Inc., ("DPSUBG"), which was then our largest independent bottler, and increased our interest to 45% in 2005. In 2000, we acquired Snapple and other brands, significantly increasing our share of the U.S. NCB market segment. In 2003, we created Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages by integrating the way we managed our four North American businesses (Mott's, Snapple, Dr Pepper/Seven Up and Mexico). During 2006 and 2007, we acquired the remaining 55% of DPSUBG and several smaller bottlers and integrated them into our Packaged Beverages segment, thereby expanding our geographic coverage.We were incorporated in Delaware on October 24, 2007. In 2008, Cadbury Schweppes plc ("Cadbury Schweppes") separated its beverage business in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean (the "Americas Beverages business") from its global confectionery business by contributing the subsidiaries that operated its Americas Beverages business to us.  Products and DistributionWe are a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the U.S, Mexico and Canada and we also distribute our products in the Caribbean. In 2011, 89% of our net sales were generated in the U.S., 4% in Canada and 7% in Mexico and the Caribbean. We sold 1.6 billion equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases in 2011.

See "Market and Industry Data" below for further information.The Sunkist soda, Rose’s and Margaritaville logos are registered trademarks of Sunkist Growers, Inc., Cadbury Ireland Limited, which was acquired by Kraft Foods, Inc. ("Kraft") on February 2, 2010, and Margaritaville Enterprises, LLC, respectively, and are in each case used by us under license. All other logos in the table above are registered trademarks of DPS or its subsidiaries.3Table of ContentsIn the CSD market in the U.S. and Canada, we participate primarily in the flavored CSD category. Our key brands are Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, 7UP, A&W, Sunkist soda, Crush and Sun Drop, and we also sell regional and smaller niche brands. In the CSD market we are primarily a manufacturer of beverage concentrates and fountain syrups. Beverage concentrates are highly concentrated proprietary flavors used to make syrup or finished beverages. We manufacture beverage concentrates that are used by our own Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, as well as sold to third party bottling companies. According to Nielsen, we had a 21.1% share of the U.S. CSD market in 2011 (measured by retail sales), which decreased 0.2% compared to  2010. We also manufacture fountain syrup that we sell to the foodservice industry directly, through bottlers or through third parties.In the NCB market segment in the U.S., we participate primarily in the ready-to-drink tea, juice, juice drinks and mixer categories. Our key NCB brands are Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott’s, and Clamato, and we also sell regional and smaller niche brands. We manufacture most of our NCBs as ready-to-drink beverages and distribute them through our own distribution network and through third parties or direct to our customers’ warehouses. In addition to NCB beverages, we also manufacture Mott’s apple sauce as a finished product.In Mexico and the Caribbean, we participate primarily in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSD, bottled water and vegetable juice categories. Our key brands in Mexico include Squirt, Peñafiel, Aguafiel, Crush and Clamato. In Mexico, we manufacture and sell our brands through both our own manufacturing and distribution operations and third party bottlers. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products solely through third party distributors and bottlers.In 2011, we manufactured and/or distributed approximately 46% of our total products sold in the U.S. (as measured by volume). In addition, our businesses manufacture and distribute a variety of brands owned by third parties in specified licensed geographic territories.Our Strengths The key strengths of our business are:Strong portfolio of leading, consumer-preferred brands.  We own a diverse portfolio of well-known CSD and NCB brands. Many of our brands enjoy high levels of consumer awareness, preference and loyalty rooted in their rich heritage, which drive their market positions. Our diverse portfolio provides our bottlers, distributors and retailers with a wide variety of products and provides us with a platform for growth and profitability. We are the #1 flavored CSD company in the U.S. Our largest brand, Dr Pepper, is the #2 flavored CSD in the U.S., according to Nielsen, and our Snapple brand is a leading ready-to-drink tea. Overall, in 2011, approximately 84% of our volume was generated by brands that hold either the #1 or #2 position in their category. The strength of our significant brands has allowed us to launch innovations and brand extensions such as Dr Pepper TEN, Blue Raspberry Crush, Snapple's Papaya Mango Tea and Tea Will Be Loved and Mott's Garden Blend in 2011. During 2011, we also launched Sun Drop, a popular regional brand within our portfolio of CSD brands, across the U.S. Integrated business model.  Our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses. For example, we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products. Additionally, our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales, service, distribution, promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. Our manufacturing and distribution system also enables us to improve focus on our brands, especially certain of our brands such as 7UP, Sunkist soda, A&W, Squirt, Vernors, Canada Dry, Hawaiian Punch and Snapple, which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with The Coca-Cola Company ("Coca-Cola") or PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo"). Strong customer relationships.  Our brands have enjoyed long-standing relationships with many of our top customers. We sell our products to a wide range of customers, from bottlers and distributors to national retailers, large food service and convenience store customers. We have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors, including those affiliated with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, some of the largest and most important retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart"), The Kroger Co., SUPERVALU, INC, Safeway Inc., Publix and Target Corporation, some of the largest food service customers, including McDonald’s Corporation, Yum! Brands, Inc., Burger King Corp., Sonic Corp., Wendy's/Arby's Group, Inc., Jack in the Box, Inc. and Subway Restaurants, and convenience store customers, including 7-Eleven, Inc. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers. 4Table of ContentsAttractive positioning within a large and profitable market.  We hold the #1 position in the U.S. flavored CSD beverage markets by volume according to Beverage Digest. We are also a leader in Canada and Mexico beverage markets. We believe that these markets are well-positioned to benefit from emerging consumer trends such as the need for convenience and the demand for products with health and wellness benefits. Our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored CSDs, which continue to gain market share versus cola CSDs, but also focuses on emerging categories such as teas, energy drinks and juices.Broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.  As of December 31, 2011, we had 18 manufacturing facilities and 116 principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the U.S., as well as three manufacturing facilities and seven  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in Mexico. These facilities use a variety of manufacturing processes. We have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enabling us to better align our operations with our customers, reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches. In addition, our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand. We actively manage transportation of our products using our own fleet of approximately 6,000 delivery trucks, as well as third party logistics providers on a selected basis.Strong operating margins and stable cash flows.  The breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows. These cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives, such as investing in our business, repurchasing shares of our common stock, paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt. Experienced executive management team.  Our executive management team has over 200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry. The team has broad experience in brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution, and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers. In addition, our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies, including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing, improving productivity of our operations, aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions. Our Strategy The key elements of our business strategy are to: Build and enhance leading brands.  We have a well-defined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources. We use an on-going process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth. We intend to continue to invest most heavily in our key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness, developing innovative products and extending brands to take advantage of evolving consumer trends, improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness. We also focus on new distribution agreements for emerging, high-growth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network. We can provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow, and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment. Increase presence in high margin channels and packages.  We are focused on improving our product presence in high margin channels, such as convenience stores, vending machines and small independent retail outlets, through increased selling activity and significant investments in coolers and other cold drink equipment. We have continued the expanded placement program for our branded coolers and other cold drink equipment and intend to selectively increase the number of those types of equipment where we believe we can achieve an attractive return on investment. We also intend to increase demand for high margin products like single-serve packages for many of our key brands through increased promotional activity. Leverage our integrated business model.  We believe our integrated brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our integrated business model to reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales, service, distribution, promotions and product launches.  Strengthen our route-to-market.  Strengthening our route-to-market will ensure the ongoing health of our brands. We have rolled out handheld technology and are upgrading our information technology ("IT") infrastructure to improve route productivity and data integrity and standards. With third party bottlers, we continue to deliver programs that maintain priority for our brands in their systems. 5Table of ContentsImprove operating efficiency.  We have been able to create multi-product manufacturing facilities which provide a region with a wide variety of our products at reduced transportation and co-packing costs. In 2010, we launched our Rapid Continuous Improvement ("RCI") initiative, which uses Lean and Six Sigma tools to deliver customer value and improve productivity. We believe RCI should enable us to leverage top line growth to accelerate net income growth and improve free cash flow.  Our Business Operations As of December 31, 2011, our operating structure consists of three business segments: Beverage Concentrates, Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages. Segment financial data for 2011, 2010 and 2009, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations, is included in Note 19 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.Beverage ConcentratesOur Beverage Concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business. In this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are CSD brands. In 2011, our Beverage Concentrates segment had net sales of approximately $1.2 billion. Key brands include Dr Pepper, Crush, Canada Dry, Sunkist soda, Schweppes, 7UP, A&W, RC Cola, Squirt, Sun Drop, Diet Rite, Welch's, Country Time, Vernors and the concentrate form of Hawaiian Punch. We are the industry leader in flavored CSDs with a 40.0% market share in the U.S. for 2011, as measured by retail sales according to Nielsen. We are also the third largest CSD brand owner as measured by 2011 retail sales in the U.S. and Canada and we own a leading brand in most of the CSD categories in which we compete. Almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in St. Louis, Missouri.Beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers, as well as to our own manufacturing systems, who combine them with carbonation, water, sweeteners and other ingredients, package it in PET containers, glass bottles and aluminum cans, and sell it as a finished beverage to retailers. Beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup, which is shipped to fountain customers, such as fast food restaurants, who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers. Dr Pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume. Concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis.Our Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers, including our own Packaged Beverages segment, through all major retail channels including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. Unlike the majority of our other CSD brands, 70% of Dr Pepper volumes are distributed through the Coca-Cola affiliated and PepsiCo affiliated bottler systems.PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are the two largest customers of the Beverage Concentrates segment, and constituted approximately 29% and 20%, respectively, of the segment's net sales during 2011. Packaged Beverages Our Packaged Beverages segment is principally a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. In this segment, we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products, including our brands, third party owned brands and certain private label beverages, in the U.S. and Canada. In 2011, our Packaged Beverages segment had net sales of approximately $4.3 billion. Key NCB brands in this segment include Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, Mott's, Yoo-Hoo, Clamato, Deja Blue, AriZona, FIJI, Mistic, Nantucket Nectars, ReaLemon, Mr and Mrs T, Rose's and Country Time. Key CSD brands in this segment include 7UP, Dr Pepper, A&W, Sunkist soda, Canada Dry, Squirt, RC Cola, Big Red, Sun Drop, Diet Rite, IBC and Vernors. Approximately 87% of our 2011 Packaged Beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands, with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as Big Red, AriZona tea, FIJI mineral water, Neuro beverages, Vita Coco coconut water and Hydrive energy drinks. A portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others, which is also referred to as contract manufacturing. Although the majority of our Packaged Beverages’ net sales relate to our brands, we also provide a route-to-market for third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands. These brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment. 6Table of ContentsOur Packaged Beverages’ products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the U.S. and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors. The raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paper products, sweeteners, juices, water and other ingredients. We sell our Packaged Beverages’ products both through our Direct Store Delivery system ("DSD"), supported by a fleet of approximately 6,000 vehicles and 12,000 employees, including sales representatives, merchandisers, drivers and warehouse workers, as well as through our Warehouse Direct delivery system ("WD"), both of which include the sales to all major retail channels, including supermarkets, fountain channel, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. In 2011, Wal-Mart, the largest customer of our Packaged Beverages segment, accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales in this segment.Latin America Beverages Our Latin America Beverages segment is a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. This segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSD, bottled water and vegetable juice categories, with particular strength in carbonated mineral water, vegetable juice categories and grapefruit flavored CSDs. In 2011, our Latin America Beverages segment had net sales of $418 million with our operations in Mexico representing approximately 89% of the net sales of this segment. Key brands include Squirt, Peñafiel, Aguafiel, Crush and Clamato.In Mexico, we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors. In Mexico, we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture Aguafiel brand water with Acqua Minerale San Benedetto. We provide expertise in the Mexican beverage market and Acqua Minerale San Benedetto provides expertise in water production and new packaging technologies. We sell our finished beverages through all major Mexican retail channels, including "mom and pop" stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and on premise channels. Bottler and Distributor AgreementsIn the U.S. and Canada, we generally grant perpetual, exclusive license agreements for CSD brands and packages to bottlers for specific geographic areas. These agreements prohibit bottlers from selling the licensed products outside their exclusive territory and selling any imitative products in that territory. Generally, we may terminate bottling agreements only for cause or change in control and the bottler may terminate without cause upon giving certain specified notice and complying with other applicable conditions. Fountain agreements for bottlers generally are not exclusive for a territory, but do restrict bottlers from carrying imitative product in the territory. Many of our brands such as Snapple, Mistic, Stewart’s, Nantucket Nectars, Yoo-Hoo and Orangina, are licensed for distribution in various territories to bottlers and a number of smaller distributors such as beer wholesalers, wine and spirit distributors, independent distributors and retail brokers. We may terminate some of these distribution agreements only for cause and the distributor may terminate without cause upon certain notice and other conditions. Either party may terminate some of the other distribution agreements without cause upon giving certain specified notice and complying with other applicable conditions. Agreement with PepsiCoOn February 26, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to PepsiCo following PepsiCo’s acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group ("PBG") and PepsiAmericas, Inc. ("PAS").Under the licensing agreements, PepsiCo began distributing Dr Pepper, Crush and Schweppes in the U.S. territories where these brands were previously being distributed by PBG and PAS. The same applies to Dr Pepper, Crush, Schweppes, Vernors and Sussex in Canada; and Squirt and Canada Dry in Mexico.Additionally, in U.S. territories where it has a distribution footprint, we distribute certain owned and licensed brands, including Sunkist soda, Squirt, Vernors, Canada Dry and Hawaiian Punch, that were previously distributed by PBG and PAS.Under the agreements, we received a one-time nonrefundable cash payment of $900 million. The new agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods, and requires PepsiCo to meet certain performance conditions. The payment was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25-year life of the customer relationship.7Table of ContentsAgreement with Coca-ColaOn October 4, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to Coca-Cola following Coca-Cola’s acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises' ("CCE") North American Bottling Business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which Coca-Cola began offering Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local fountain accounts and the Freestyle fountain program.Under the licensing agreements, Coca-Cola distributes Dr Pepper in the U.S. and Canada Dry in the Northeast territories where these brands were formerly distributed by CCE. The same applies to Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada. As part of the U.S. licensing agreement, Coca-Cola offers Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in its local fountain accounts. The agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods, and requires Coca-Cola to meet certain performance conditions.Under a separate agreement, Coca-Cola has agreed to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper brands in its Freestyle fountain program. The Freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years. Additionally, in certain U.S. territories where it has a distribution footprint, we are selling certain owned and licensed brands, including Canada Dry, Schweppes, Squirt and Cactus Cooler, that were previously distributed by CCE.     Under these arrangements, we received a one-time nonrefundable cash payment of $715 million, which was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25-year life of the customer relationship.      CustomersWe primarily serve two groups of customers: 1) bottlers and distributors and 2) retailers.Bottlers buy beverage concentrates from us and, in turn, they manufacture, bottle, sell and distribute finished beverages. Bottlers also manufacture and distribute syrup for the fountain foodservice channel. In addition, bottlers and distributors purchase finished beverages from us and sell them to retail and other customers. We have strong relationships with bottlers affiliated with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo primarily because of the strength and market position of our key Dr Pepper brand.Retailers also buy finished beverages directly from us. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 2011, our largest retailer was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., representing approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales. Seasonality The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations. CompetitionThe LRB industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based upon brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. Our two largest competitors in the LRB market are Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which collectively represent approximately 62% of the U.S. LRB market by volume, according to Beverage Digest. We also compete against other large companies, including Nestlé, S.A. ("Nestle") and Kraft. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. As a bottler and manufacturer, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers, such as The Cott Corporation ("Cott"). Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. We have lower exposure to some of the faster growing non-carbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall LRB market. In Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors. Although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors, many of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us.8Table of Contents Intellectual Property and Trademarks Our Intellectual Property.  We possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights, including our brands and ingredient and production formulas for our products. Our Trademarks.  Our trademark portfolio includes approximately 2,400 registrations and applications in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries. Brands we own through various subsidiaries in various jurisdictions include Dr Pepper, 7UP, A&W, Canada Dry, RC Cola, Schweppes, Squirt, Crush, Peñafiel, Sun Drop, Aguafiel, Snapple, Mott’s, Hawaiian Punch, Clamato, Mistic, Nantucket Nectars, Mr & Mrs T, ReaLemon, Venom and Deja Blue. We own trademark registrations for most of these brands in the U.S., and we own trademark registrations for some but not all of these brands in Canada, Mexico and other countries. We also own a number of smaller regional brands. Some of our other trademark registrations are in countries where we do not currently have any significant level of business. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico, our rights to many of our brands, including our Dr Pepper trademark and formula, were sold by Cadbury Schweppes beginning over a decade ago to third parties including, in certain cases, to competitors such as Coca-Cola. Trademarks Licensed from Others.  We license various trademarks from third parties, which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute throughout the U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico. For example, we license from third parties the Sunkist soda, Welch’s, Country Time, Orangina, Stewart’s, Rose’s, Holland House and Margaritaville trademarks. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor.Licensed Distribution Rights.  We have rights in certain territories to bottle and/or distribute various brands we do not own, such as AriZona tea, FIJI mineral water, Neuro beverages and Vita Coco coconut water. Some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term, are limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us. Intellectual Property We License to Others.  We license some of our intellectual property, including trademarks, to others. For example, we license the Dr Pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food, confectionery and other products. We also license certain brands, such as Dr Pepper and Snapple, to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers’ changing preferences and needs. We identify these preferences and needs and develop innovative solutions to address the opportunities. Solutions include new and reformulated products, improved packaging design, pricing and enhanced availability. We use advertising, media, sponsorships, merchandising, public relations and promotion to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages. Manufacturing As of December 31, 2011, we operated 20 manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Mexico, excluding our manufacturing facility for our joint venture with Acqua Minerale San Benedetto. Almost all of our CSD beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in St. Louis, Missouri. All of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities, with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages, facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products, or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities.  We employed approximately 5,000 full-time manufacturing employees in our facilities as of December 31, 2011. We have a variety of production capabilities, including hot-fill, cold-fill and aseptic bottling processes, and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials, including aluminum, glass and PET cans and bottles and a variety of package formats, including single-serve and multi-serve packages and "bag-in-box" fountain syrup packaging. In 2011, 89% of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 11% from third party and private-label products. We also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis. We owned property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, totaling $1,080 million and $1,092 million in the U.S. and $72 million and $76 million in international locations as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.9Table of ContentsWarehousing and Distribution As of December 31, 2011, our distribution network consisted of 116 principal distribution centers and warehouses in the U.S. and seven principal distribution centers and warehouses in Mexico. Our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand. We actively manage the sale, merchandising and transportation of our products using combination of our own fleet of  approximately 6,000 delivery vehicles, as well as third party logistics providers. Raw Materials The principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paper products, sweeteners, juice, fruit, water and other ingredients. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially. In addition, we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses.Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging. Manufacturing costs for our Packaged Beverages segment, where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages, are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our Beverage Concentrates segment as the Packaged Beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients. Although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers, we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials. When appropriate, we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements. The intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of short-term predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure, while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position. Research and Development Our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and Mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal, can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network. Our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development, microbiology, analytical chemistry, process engineering, sensory science, nutrition, knowledge management and regulatory compliance. We have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners. Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to $15 million, $16 million and $15 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, we incurred packaging engineering costs of $6 million for each of 2011 and 2010. Packaging engineering costs for 2009 were $7 million. These expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Information Technology and Transaction Processing Services We use a variety of IT systems and networks configured to meet our business needs. Our primary IT data center is hosted in Toronto, Canada by a third party provider. We also use a third party vendor for application support and maintenance, which is based in India and provides resources offshore and onshore. We use a business process outsourcing provider located in India to provide certain back office transactional processing services, including accounting, order entry and other transactional services. EmployeesAt December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 19,000 employees.In the U.S., we have approximately 16,000 full-time employees. We have many union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4,000 full-time employees. Several agreements cover multiple locations. These agreements often address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits. In Mexico and the Caribbean, we employ approximately 3,000 full-time employees, with approximately 1,000 employees party to collective bargaining agreements. We do not have a significant number of employees in Canada.We believe we have good relations with our employees.10Table of Contents Regulatory MattersWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients, manufacturing, safety, labeling, transportation, recycling, advertising and sale. For example, our products, and their manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale in the U.S. are subject to various aspects of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws. In Canada and Mexico, the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations.We and our bottlers use various refillable and non-refillable, recyclable bottles and cans in the U.S. and other countries. Various states and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes or fees on certain containers. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. In Mexico, the government has encouraged the soft drinks industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material, and we are in compliance with these programs. Environmental, Health and Safety MattersIn the normal course of our business, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environment, health and safety laws and regulations. We maintain environmental, health and safety policies and a quality, environmental, health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations. Available InformationOur web site address is www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com. Information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document. We make available, free of charge through this web site, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Market and Industry DataThe market and industry data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is from independent industry sources, including Nielsen and Beverage Digest. Although we believe that these independent sources are reliable, we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data.Nielsen is a marketing information provider, primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers. We use Nielsen data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage, is based on consumer transactions at retailers, and is reported to us monthly. Nielsen data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share, retail pricing, promotional activity and distribution across various channels, retailers and geographies. Measured categories provided to us by Nielsen Scantrack include flavored (non-cola) CSDs, energy drinks, single-serve bottled water, non-alcoholic mixers and NCBs, including ready-to-drink teas, single-serve and multi-serve juice and juice drinks, and sports drinks. Nielsen also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce. Nielsen data we present in this report is from Nielsen's Scantrack service, which compiles data based on scanner transactions in certain sales channels, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers, drug chains, convenience stores and gas stations. However, this data does not include the fountain or vending channels, Wal-Mart or small independent retail outlets, which together represent a meaningful portion of the U.S. LRB market and of our net sales and volume.Beverage Digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual Beverage Digest Fact Book. We use Beverage Digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends. This annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies. Beverage Digest covers the following categories: CSDs, energy drinks, bottled water and NCBs (including ready-to-drink teas, juice and juice drinks and sports drinks). Beverage Digest data does not include multi-serve juice products or bottled water in packages of 1.5 liters or more. Data is reported for certain sales channels, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, drug chains, convenience stores, gas stations, fountains, vending machines and the “up-and-down-the-street” channel consisting of small independent retail outlets.11Table of ContentsWe use both Nielsen and Beverage Digest to assess both our own and our competitors’ performance and market share in the U.S. Different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from Nielsen or Beverage Digest is used, in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source. For example, because the fountain channel (where we have a relatively small business except for Dr Pepper) is not included in Nielsen data, our market share using Nielsen data is generally higher for our CSD portfolio than the Beverage Digest data, which does include the fountain channel.In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all information regarding the beverage market in the U.S. is from Beverage Digest, and, except as otherwise indicated, is from 2010. All information regarding our brand market positions in the U.S. is from Nielsen and is based on retail dollar sales in 2011.ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our BusinessIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could harm our business and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets.The LRB industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based upon brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. Our two largest competitors in the LRB market are Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which represent approximately 62% of the U.S. LRB market by volume, according to Beverage Digest. We also compete against other large companies, including Nestle and Kraft. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. As a bottler and manufacturer, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers, such as Cott. Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. We have lower exposure to energy drinks, some of the faster growing non-carbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall LRB market. In Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors.Our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. As a result, we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing, advertising and product innovation. Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.We may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, trends, health concerns and other factors.Consumers' preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including aging of the population, social trends, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. For example, consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness, and demand for regular CSDs has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and, increasingly, to NCBs, such as water, ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences, then quickly develop new products in response, our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.We depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.Food and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.12Table of ContentsWe depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business.Net sales from our Beverage Concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own. The Beverage Concentrates segment's net sales generate a portion of our overall net sales. Some of these bottlers, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, are our competitors. The majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products. In addition, some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties. As independent companies, these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors’ products and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In most cases, they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause. We may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the U.S., Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume and/or switching to lower price offerings. Similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or our vendors to timely supply materials.We could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements. Declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our pension fund, which in turn could increase funding requirements.Costs for commodities may increase substantially.The principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paperboard packaging, sweeteners, juice, fruit, water and other ingredients. Additionally, conversion of raw materials into our products for sale also uses electricity and natural gas. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially. We are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers. Under many of our supply arrangements, the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging. Continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which include employment, tort, real estate, commercial and other litigation.  From time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation, including litigation regarding employment practices, product labeling, and wage and hour laws.  Plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time.  We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. We may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. Costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual  settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results.  Increases in our cost of benefits and multi-employer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future could reduce our profitability.Our profitability is substantially affected by the costs of pension, postretirement, employee medical costs and other benefits. In recent years, these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. These factors plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance. Although we actively seek to control increases in costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in costs, could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial performance. 13Table of ContentsAdditionally, the Company currently participates in four multi-employer pension plans in the United States. Our pension expense for U.S. multi-employer plans totaled $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The plans we participate in have collective bargaining agreements that extend into 2015.  In the event that we or, in the case of one multi-employer pension plan,  another large employer withdraw from participation in any of these plans, then applicable law could require us to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods.Our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated.Monster Beverage Corporation (formerly Hansen Natural Corporation) and glacéau terminated their distribution agreements with us in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We are subject to a risk of other allied brands, such as FIJI, AriZona, Neuro and Vita Coco, terminating their distribution agreements with us, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.Determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2011, we had $9.3 billion of total assets, of which approximately $5.7 billion were goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets include both definite and indefinite intangible assets in connection with brands, bottler agreements, distribution rights and customer relationships. We conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually, as of December 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. There was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of December 31, 2011. For additional information about these intangible assets, see “Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets” in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Income," and our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our Consolidated Statements of Income, which may adversely affect our results of operations.Our total indebtedness could affect our operations and profitability.We maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, our total indebtedness was $2,712 million. This amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:•requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt; and•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, which could impact our debt maturity profile.While we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control.Certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur.Some raw materials we use, such as aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles, sweeteners, juice and other ingredients, are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or less-developed countries or regions. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.14Table of ContentsSubstantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.A disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility, which manufactures almost all of our concentrates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.Our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading.We have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. We expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep up-to-date various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations, including closing existing facilities or opening new ones. If our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities, our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected.We may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience strikes.As of December 31, 2011, approximately 5,000 of our employees, many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. This could result in strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. The terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency.We depend on key information systems and third party service providers.We depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. We rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services, including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting, order entry and other transactional services. These systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, hackers, other security issues or supplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.Our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated.We have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.We may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and they could change.We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. See "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1, "Business," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling laws, such as California's "Prop 65," which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, could become applicable to our products.15Table of ContentsSome local and regional governments and school boards have enacted, or have proposed to enact, regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, or disrupt the production or distribution of our products, and negatively affect our business and financial performance. In addition, taxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal, state, local and foreign governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our products. Our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including termination of distribution rights, could harm our business.We possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. See “Intellectual Property and Trademarks” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brands, products and business could be harmed.We also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties. In some countries, other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the U.S., Canada or Mexico. For example, the Dr Pepper trademark and formula is owned by Coca-Cola in certain other countries. Adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands.In some cases, we license products from third parties which we distribute. The licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee. The termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance.We could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel.Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them. Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected. We do not have “key person” life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees.Weather and climate changes could adversely affect our business.Unseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials, energy and fuel, and demand for our products. Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.There is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns ("global warming"). Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, could negatively impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that we use to produce our products. Additionally, the sale of our products can be negatively impacted by weather conditions.Concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on GHG emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries that we operate. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients, and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results.Changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results. The number of new accounting standards or pronouncements is increasing as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board work towards a convergence of accounting standards. Certain standards may become applicable for us and change the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, which could have a significant effect on our reported results or financial position for the affected periods.
