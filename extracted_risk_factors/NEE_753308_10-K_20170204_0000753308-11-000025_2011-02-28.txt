NEXTERA ENERGY




NextEra Energy is one of the largest electric power companies in North America and the U.S. leading producer of renewable energy from wind and solar projects.  At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy had nearly 43,000 mw of generating capacity - approximately 53% natural gas, 19% wind, 13% nuclear, 13% oil and coal, and 2% hydro and solar.  NextEra Energy’s clean generation fleet gives the company significantly lower emissions rates of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide than the electric power industry as a whole.  In addition to fuel diversity, NextEra Energy has geographic diversity with approximately 15,000 employees overseeing operations in 28 states and Canada.  Wind assets are in service in 17 states and three Canadian provinces.  NextEra Energy also operat
es the third-largest nuclear fleet in the United States with eight units at five plants in four states.




NextEra Energy was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of Florida and has two principal operating subsidiaries, FPL and NextEra Energy Resources.  FPL is a rate-regulated utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida.  NextEra Energy Resources is NextEra Energy's competitive energy subsidiary which produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable fuels.  Capital Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, holds the capital stock of, or has equity interests in, and provides funding for, NextEra Energy's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries, including NextEra Energy Resources.

FPL OPERATIONS




General.  FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida, serving more than 8.7 million people through approximately 4.5 million customer accounts, and one of the largest electric utilities in the United States.  FPL supplies electric service throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida.  Incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925, FPL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy.




FPL is a vertically integrated, rate-regulated utility with 23,722 mw of generating assets as of December 31, 2010.  FPL’s typical monthly residential customer bill was the lowest of all 55 electricity providers in the state of Florida as of December 31, 2010, and was 24% below the national average as of July 2010, the most recent data available.




During 2010, FPL delivered 99.98% service reliability to its customers, and was in the top quartile nationwide for reliability based on 2009, the most recent data available.  With a generating fleet that produces 78% of its electric power from natural gas and nuclear, FPL is also one the cleanest utilities in the nation, with an overall carbon dioxide emissions rate 35% below the industry average.




During 2010, FPL completed construction of a 75 mw hybrid solar power facility that combines a solar-thermal trough array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas plant.  FPL has 110 mw of solar generating capacity in its portfolio, more than any other utility outside of California.




FPL’s fossil fleet achieved a record level of fuel efficiency in 2010, with a system-wide heat rate of 8,043 British thermal units per kwh compared with 10,060 for the industry as a whole in 2009, the most recent data available.  FPL has maintained operational efficiency as well, with O&M expenses for 2010 of 1.5 cents per kwh, compared with a 2009 industry average of 2.2 cents per kwh.

Regulation.  FPL's retail operations provided approximately 98% of FPL's 2010 operating revenues.  Retail operations are regulated by the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities and other matters.  FPL is also subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to certain aspects of its operations, including, but not limited to, the acquisition and disposition of facilities, interchange and transmission services and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy.  FPL must also comply with mandatory reliability standards established by the NERC to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and
 to prevent major system blackouts.  In addition, FPL's nuclear power plants are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  NRC regulations govern the granting of licenses for the construction, operation and maintenance and retirement of nuclear power plants and subject these plants to continuing review and regulation.




Retail Ratemaking.  The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility the opportunity to collect from customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.  To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.




Base Rates - In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system.  These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base).  At the time base rates are determined, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of FPL's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed ROE.  The FPSC monitors FPL's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed mon
thly by FPL with the FPSC.  The FPSC does not provide assurance that an allowed ROE will be achieved.  Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements, which occur at the initiative of FPL, the FPSC, the State of Florida Office of Public Counsel or a substantially affected party.  Base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.




Effective March 1, 2010, pursuant to an FPSC final order (FPSC rate order) with regard to FPL’s March 2009 petition (2009 rate case) that requested, among other things, a permanent base rate increase, new retail base rates for FPL were established, resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of approximately $75 million on an annualized basis.  The FPSC rate order also established a regulatory ROE of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points and an adjusted regulatory equity ratio of 59.1%, and shifted certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity clause.  In addition, the FPSC rate order directed FPL to reduce depreciation expense (surplus depreciation credit) over the 2010 to 2013 period related to a depreciation reserve surplus.  In August 2010, FPL, the State of Flori
da Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Attorney General's Office and all other principal parties in FPL's 2009 rate case signed a stipulation and settlement regarding FPL's base rates (2010 rate agreement).  In December 2010, the FPSC voted to approve the 2010 rate agreement and on February 1, 2011 issued a final order reflecting its decision to approve the 2010 rate agreement.  Key elements of the 2010 rate agreement, which will be effective through December 31, 2012, are as follows:








·


Subject to the provisions of the 2010 rate agreement, retail base rates will be effectively frozen through the end of 2012.



·


Incremental cost recovery through FPL’s capacity clause for the new combined-cycle natural gas unit at WCEC (WCEC Unit No. 3), which is expected to be placed in service by mid-2011, will be permitted up to the amount of the projected fuel savings for customers during the term of the 2010 rate agreement.  See Fossil Operations below.



·


Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an accelerated basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kwh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery.  Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years.  If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge for the amount above $800 million.



·


If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief.  If FPL's earned regulatory ROE rises above 11%, any party to the 2010 rate agreement may seek a reduction in FPL’s retail base rates.  In determining the regulatory ROE for all purposes under the 2010 rate agreement, earnings will be calculated on an actual, non-weather-adjusted basis.

·


FPL can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in 2010 of $267 million, a cap in subsequent years of $267 million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years, and a cap of $776 million (surplus depreciation credit cap) over the course of the 2010 rate agreement, provided that in any year of the 2010 rate agreement, including 2010, FPL must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a 9% earned regulatory ROE but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11%.







Prior to the date new retail base rates were effective pursuant to the FPSC rate order, FPL's retail base rates were determined in accordance with the terms of a rate agreement approved in 2005 (2005 rate agreement), which was effective January 1, 2006.  See Management's Discussion - Overview for a discussion of the 2005 rate agreement.




Cost Recovery Clauses - Cost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses, conservation and certain environmental-related expenses, certain revenue taxes and franchise fees.  Beginning in 2009, pre-construction costs and carrying charges for FPL's two additional nuclear units at Turkey Point and carrying charges on construction costs for FPL's approximately 400 mw to 460 mw of additional capacity at St. Lucie and Turkey Point are also recovered through a cost recovery clause.  Also beginning in 2009, costs incurred for FPL's three solar generating facilities are re
covered through a cost recovery clause.  Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kwh or kw, depending on the customer's rate class.  These cost recovery clause charges are calculated at least annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus a true-up adjustment to reflect the variance of actual costs and usage from the estimates used in setting the adjustment charges for prior periods.  An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates.




In 2010, fuel clause recoveries were approximately $4.5 billion.  FPL uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC.  The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs.  The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPL's fuel requirements.  See Energy Marketing and Trading below, Management's Discussion - Results of Operations - FPL, Note 1 - Regulation and Note 3.




Capacity payments to other utilities and generating companies for purchased power are recovered from customers through the capacity clause.  Prior to March 2010, such payments were recovered through the capacity clause and base rates.  In accordance with the FPSC's nuclear cost recovery rule, FPL also recovers pre-construction costs and carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through the capacity clause.  As property related to the new capacity goes into service, construction costs are recovered through base rate increases.  See Nuclear Operations below.  In accordance with the 2010 rate agreement, cost recovery for WCEC Unit No. 3, which is expected to be placed in service by mid-2011, will be permitted up to the amount of the pro
jected fuel savings for customers during the term of the 2010 rate agreement through FPL's capacity clause and will be reported as retail base revenues.  See Base Rates above.  In 2010, capacity clause recoveries were approximately $606 million.




Costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs are recovered from customers through the conservation clause.  In 2010, conservation clause recoveries were approximately $187 million.  Certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with FPL's three solar facilities are recovered through the environmental clause.  In 2010, environmental clause recoveries were approximately $175 million.  See Environmental and Solar Operations below.




The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred.  Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.




Competition.  FPL currently holds 176 franchise agreements to provide electric service in various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2040.  Of the 176 franchise agreements, 8 expire in 2011, 7 expire in 2012 and 161 expire during the period 2013 through 2040.  Negotiations are ongoing to renew franchises with upcoming expirations.  FPL also provides service to 13 other municipalities and to 22 unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements.  FPL considers its franchises to be adequate for the conduct of its business.




FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self-generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers.  The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions.  In 2010, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 3% of FPL's total operating revenues.  Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier.  Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in Florida in the near future.  If the
 basis of regulation for some or all of FPL's business changes from cost-based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund.  Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long-term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment.  See Management's Discussion - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Regulatory Accounting.

The FPSC promotes cost competitiveness in the building of new steam generating capacity by requiring investor-owned electric utilities, such as FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest.  The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity.  If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a power purchase agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the power purchase agreement and, if appropriate
, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.  New nuclear power plants are exempt from the RFP requirement.  See Nuclear Operations below regarding the approval by the FPSC for two additional nuclear units at Turkey Point.




Environmental.  FPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations and is affected by some of the emerging issues included in the Environmental Matters section.  FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.




During 2010, FPL spent approximately $181 million on capital additions related to environmental matters, primarily to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations.  FPL's capital expenditures related to environmental matters are estimated to be $228 million for 2011 through 2013, including approximately $122 million in 2011, and are included in estimated planned capital expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures below.




System Capability and Load.  At December 31, 2010, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of 25,800 mw, of which 23,722 mw were from FPL-owned facilities (see Item 2 - Generating Facilities) and 2,078 mw were available through purchased power contracts (see Note 14 - Contracts).  FPL's projected reserve margin for the summer of 2011 is approximately 23%.  This reserve margin is expected to be achieved through the combination of output from FPL's active generating units (excluding solar, which is not considered a firm energy generator resource), purchased power contracts and the capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of demand side management (DSM) programs, including load management, which was 
estimated at December 31, 2010 to be capable of reducing demand by 1,805 mw, and energy efficiency and conservation programs.  In 2009, the FPSC issued an order that will require Florida utilities, including FPL, to meet higher DSM goals for both demand and energy.  FPL submitted its DSM plan to the FPSC in 2010 and, in January 2011, the FPSC ordered FPL to submit a revised plan by March 2011.  Once a DSM plan is approved by the FPSC, program standards will be submitted to the FPSC for approval.  Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.  However, customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service territory.  The highest peak load FPL has served to date was 24,346 mw, which occurred on January 11, 2010.  FPL had adequate res
ources available at the time of this peak to meet customer demand.  See Fossil Operations and Nuclear Operations below regarding generation projects currently under construction.




Fuel Mix.  FPL's generating plants use a variety of fuels.  The diverse fuel sources, along with purchased power, are intended to enable FPL to shift between sources of generation to achieve a more economical fuel mix.  See Fossil Operations and Nuclear Operations below, and Item 2 - Generating Facilities.

Fossil Operations.  At December 31, 2010, FPL owned and operated 79 units that used fossil fuels such as natural gas and/or oil, and has a joint-ownership interest in three coal units.  These fossil units are out of service from time to time for routine maintenance or on standby during periods of reduced electricity demand.  FPL is currently constructing WCEC Unit No. 3, a natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit of approximately 1,220 mw, which is expected to be placed in service by mid-2011.  FPL is also in the process of modernizing its Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants to high-efficiency natural gas-fired units and expects the units to be placed in service by 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Each mo
dernized plant is expected to provide approximately 1,200 mw of capacity.  See Capital Expenditures below.

FPL has several firm transportation contracts in place with four different suppliers with expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2036 that together are expected to satisfy substantially all of the anticipated needs for natural gas transportation at its existing units.  To the extent desirable, FPL purchases interruptible natural gas transportation service from two suppliers based on pipeline availability.  FPL has several short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas.  The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market.  FPL has a long-term agreement for the storage of natural gas that expires in 2013.  See Note 14 - Contracts.  FPL's oil requirements are obtained under shor
t-term contracts and in the spot market.




FPL has, through its joint ownership interest in St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) Units Nos. 1 and 2, a coal supply and transportation contract for all of the 2011 fuel needs and a portion of the 2012 and 2013 fuel needs for those units.  All of the transportation requirements and a portion of the coal supply needs for Scherer Unit No. 4 are covered by a series of annual and long-term contracts.  FPL's remaining fuel requirements for these units will be obtained in the spot market.  See Note 14 - Contracts.




Nuclear Operations.  FPL owns, or has undivided interests in, and operates four nuclear units, two at Turkey Point and two at St. Lucie, with a total net generating capability of 2,939 mw.  The nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications.  Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for approximately 30 days.  This duration is longer for expanded scope outages, three of which are scheduled in 2011 related to the addition of capacity at FPL's existing nuclear units.  The following table summarizes certain information related to FPL's nuclear un

FPL is in the process of adding approximately 400 mw to 460 mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, which additional capacity is projected to be placed in service from spring 2011 to 2013.  The construction costs relating to the increase in capacity yet to be incurred as of December 31, 2010 are included in the estimated planned capital expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures below.  As part of the conditions of certification by the FDEP for the Turkey Point project, FPL was required to implement a monitoring plan in and around the Turkey Point cooling canals due to concerns over potential saltwater intrusion beyond FPL's property.  Monitoring under the plan includes collection of data for a minimum of two years prior to and two years after the date the addi
tional capacity is placed in service. The monitoring plan is designed to establish a baseline and assess the vertical and horizontal effects of the cooling canal system on existing and projected surface and groundwater and ecological conditions surrounding Turkey Point. The ultimate results of the monitoring plan are uncertain, and the financial and operational impacts on FPL, if any, cannot be determined at this time.  In 2008, the FPSC approved FPL's need petition for two additional nuclear units at its Turkey Point site.  The two units combined are expected to add approximately 2,200 mw of capacity and have projected in-service dates between 2022 and 2023.  Additional approvals from other regulatory agencies will be required later in the development process.  See Capital Expenditures below.




FPL has several contracts for the supply of uranium, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from March 2011 through 2022.  See Note 14 - Contracts.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (Nuclear Waste Policy Act), the DOE is responsible for the development of a repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, FPL is a party to contracts with the DOE to provide for disposal of spent nuclear fuel from its Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear units.  The DOE was required to construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for a specified fee based on current gene
ration from nuclear power plants.  Through December 31, 2010, FPL has paid approximately $651 million in such fees to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund.  The DOE did not meet its statutory obligation for disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In 2009, FPL and certain nuclear plant joint owners signed a settlement agreement (spent fuel settlement agreement) with the U.S. Government agreeing to dismiss with prejudice lawsuits filed against the U.S. Government seeking damages caused by the DOE's failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from FPL's nuclear plants.  The spent fuel settlement agreement permits FPL to make annual filings to recover certain spent fuel storage costs incurred by FPL which will be payable by the U.S. Government on an annual basis.  Through December 31, 2010, FPL has collected approximately $121 million from the U.S. Government pursuant to the spent fuel settlement agreement and has paid appro
ximately $6 million to the joint owners of St. Lucie Unit No. 2.  FPL will continue to pay fees to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund.  In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application for a high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.  The DOE’s withdrawal motion has been challenged and is being litigated before the NRC and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit).  In light of the Obama Administration's decision not to proceed with the Yucca Mountain repository project, the DOE has established a Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to conduct a comprehensive review of policies for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle and to provide recommendations for developing a safe, long-term solution to managing used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.  The BRC is scheduled to complete its activities in January 2012.

FPL uses both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2, which should allow FPL to store all spent nuclear fuel at this facility through license expiration.  FPL currently stores all spent nuclear fuel generated by Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 in on-site storage pools.  These spent nuclear fuel storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective units.  In July 2011, FPL plans to begin using dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by the Turkey Point facility, which should allow FPL to store spent nuclear fuel at this facility through license expiration.




The NRC's regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation.  FPL's current plans, under the operating licenses, provide for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033, respectively.  Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 at the end of its useful life in 2043.  See estimated decommissioning cost data in Management's Discussion - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil/Solar Dismantlement.




Solar Operations.  FPL placed its first utility-scale solar generating facility into service in 2009 and placed two additional solar generating facilities in service in 2010.  FPL's three solar generating facilities consist of a 25 mw solar PV facility in DeSoto County, Florida, a 10 mw solar PV facility in Brevard County, Florida and a 75 mw solar thermal facility in Martin County, Florida.




Energy Marketing and Trading.  FPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electricity.  EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, oil and electricity.  EMT also uses derivative instruments, such as swaps, options and forwards, to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity.  Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses.  See Retail Ratemaking above, Management's Discussion - Results of Operations - FPL and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity 
and Note 3.




Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures at FPL include, among other things, the cost for construction or acquisition of additional facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities and the procurement of nuclear fuel.




FPL's actual capital expenditures for 2008 through 2010 and estimated planned capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:

Electric and Magnetic Fields.  Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are present around electrical facilities, including, but not limited to, appliances, power lines and building wiring.  Since the 1970s, there has been public, scientific and regulatory attention given to the question of whether EMF causes or contributes to adverse health effects.  U.S. and international scientific organizations have evaluated the EMF research.  Their reviews have generally concluded that while some epidemiology studies report an association with childhood leukemia, controlled laboratory studies do not support that association and the scientific studies overall have not demonstrated that EMF cause or contribute to any type of cancer or other d
isease.

The FDEP established EMF standards for electricity facilities in 1989 and FPL facilities comply with these standards.  Future changes in the FDEP regulations could require additional capital expenditures by FPL for such things as increasing the width of right of ways or relocating or reconfiguring transmission facilities.  It is not presently known whether any such expenditures will be required.  Currently, there are no such changes proposed to the FDEP regulations.




Employees.  FPL had approximately 10,000 employees at December 31, 2010.  Approximately 32% of the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective bargaining agreement with FPL that expires October 31, 2011.




NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES OPERATIONS




General.  NextEra Energy Resources is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the United States, with 18,866 mw of generating assets across 26 states as of December 31, 2010.  The company also owns and operates wind projects in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec and Alberta.  NextEra Energy Resources is the largest owner of wind and solar energy projects in the United States and the fourth largest owner of wind projects in Canada.




Of NextEra Energy Resources’ net generating capability at December 31, 2010, more than 11,300 mw were contracted and approximately 5,800 mw operate on a merchant basis.  Its wind portfolio has expanded from 1,745 mw in 2002 to 8,298 mw in 2010.  As of December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources is the largest generator of solar energy in the United States, principally through a 310 mw facility in California’s Mojave Desert, of which 148 mw is owned by NextEra Energy Resources.  NextEra Energy Resources is pursuing additional commercial-scale solar projects in the United States, Canada and Spain.




A wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Holdings, NextEra Energy Resources was formed in 1998 to aggregate NextEra Energy's existing competitive energy businesses.  It is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware.  Through its subsidiaries, NextEra Energy Resources currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric-generating facilities in wholesale energy markets.  NextEra Energy Resources also provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and owns a retail electricity provider based in Texas.  NextEra Energy Resources also engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities.




At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources managed or participated in the management of essentially all of its projects in which it has an ownership interest.  NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in operating independent power projects with a net generating capability totaling 18,866 mw (see Item 2 - Generating Facilities).  Generation capacity spans various geographic regions in North America and is produced using a variety of fuel sources, thereby reducing overall volatility related to varying market conditions and seasonality on a portfolio basis.  At December 31, 2010, the percentage of capacity by geographic region was:

NextEra Energy Resources' strategy is, among other things, to continue to maintain its leadership position in wind, accelerate growth in solar development, continue to expand its transmission capability, grow its customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses, and develop its natural gas infrastructure business.  NextEra Energy Resources' customer supply business includes full energy and capacity requirements services and the operations of a retail electricity provider.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to expand its generation portfolio primarily through wind and solar development and acquisitions where economic prospects are attractive.  NextEra Energy Resources plans to add approximately 3,500 mw to 5,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 to 2014, including 754 mw added in 2010 and appr
oximately 700 mw to 1,000 mw in 2011.  In addition to wind expansion, NextEra Energy Resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the United States and Europe, and plans to add approximately 400 mw to 600 mw of new solar generation in 2010 to 2014, including 5 mw added in 2010.  The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support, support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, continued market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms.  NextEra Energy Resources continues to invest in natural gas infrastructure opportunities.  NextEra Energy Resources is evaluating additional natural gas infrastructure opportunities and will continue to explore additional projects as opportunities that it believes will be economically attractive become available.




NextEra Energy Resources' actual capital expenditures and investments for 2008 through 2010 and estimated planned capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:

See Management's Discussion - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations and Estimated Planned Capital Expenditures and Note 14 - Commitments.




Portfolio by Category.  NextEra Energy Resources' generating assets are categorized as follows:




Wind Assets - At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in wind generating facilities with a combined capacity of approximately 8,298 mw (net ownership), of which approximately 79% have long-term contracts with utilities and power marketers, predominantly under fixed-price agreements with a weighted-average remaining contract life of 14 years.  The expected output of the remaining 21% is substantially hedged through 2012 and partially hedged through 2018 against changes in commodity prices.  NextEra Energy Resources operates substantially all of these wind facilities.  Approximately 91% of NextEra Energy Resources' net ownership in wind facilities has received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the P
ublic Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (Holding Company Act).  Essentially all of the remaining facilities have qualifying facility status under PURPA.  NextEra Energy Resources' wind facilities are located in 17 states and Canada.  NextEra Energy Resources expects to add approximately 700 mw to 1,000 mw of new wind generation in 2011.

 



  



11







  



 

Contracted Assets - At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources had 4,740 mw of non-wind contracted assets.  The contracted category includes all projects, other than wind, with contracts for substantially all of their output.  In 2010, two natural gas-fired plants, located in California and Pennsylvania, with a combined net generating capacity of approximately 1,250 mw moved from the merchant assets category to the contracted assets category when their respective long-term power sales agreements became effective.  Essentially all of the contracted assets were under power sales contracts with utilities, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of 14 years, and have firm fuel and transportation agreements with expiration dates ranging 
from December 2011 to 2033.  See Note 14 - Contracts.  Approximately 1,550 mw of this capacity is natural gas-fired generation.  The remaining 3,190 mw use a variety of fuels and technologies such as nuclear, oil, solar and coal.  As of December 31, 2010, approximately 95% of NextEra Energy Resources' contracted generating capacity is from power plants that have received exempt wholesale generator status under the Holding Company Act, while the remaining 5% has qualifying facility status under PURPA.  During the third quarter of 2011, a natural gas plant, located in the Northeast region, with a net generating capacity of approximately 145 mw will move to the merchant assets category when its long-term power sales agreement ends.




Merchant Assets - At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources' portfolio of merchant assets includes 5,828 mw of owned nuclear, natural gas, oil and hydro generation, of which 3,036 mw is located in the Northeast region and 2,792 mw in the ERCOT region.  The merchant assets include 1,017 mw of peak generating facilities.  Merchant assets are plants that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their output and therefore require active marketing and hedging.  Approximately 71% (based on net mw capability) of the natural gas fueled merchant assets have natural gas supply agreements or a combination of natural gas supply and transportation agreements to provide for on-peak natural gas requirements.   See Note 14 - Con
tracts.  Derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) are used to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.  Managing market risk through these instruments introduces other types of risk, primarily counterparty and operational risks.  See Energy Marketing and Trading below.




Nuclear Operations.  NextEra Energy Resources wholly owns, or has undivided interests in, four nuclear units with a total net generating capability of 2,554 mw.  NextEra Energy Resources is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly owned units.  See estimated decommissioning cost data in Management's Discussion - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil/Solar Dismantlement.  The nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications

NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear facilities have several contracts for the supply of uranium, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from March 2011 through 2022.  See Note 14 - Contracts.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE is responsible for the development of a repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources are parties to contracts with the DOE to provide for disposal of spent nuclear fuel from its Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach nuclear units.  The DOE was required to construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 
31, 1998 for a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power plants.  The total cumulative amount of such fees paid to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach, including amounts paid by all joint owners, since the start of the plants' operations through December 31, 2010, is approximately $535 million, of which NextEra Energy Resources has paid approximately $115 million since the date of the plants' respective acquisitions.  The DOE did not meet its statutory obligation for disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In 2009, certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources and certain nuclear plant joint owners signed the spent fuel settlement agreement with the U.S. Government agreeing to dismiss with prejudice lawsuits filed against the U.S. Government seeking damages caused by the DOE's failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from the Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach nuclear plant
s.  The spent fuel settlement agreement permits NextEra Energy Resources to make annual filings to recover certain spent fuel storage costs incurred by NextEra Energy Resources which will be payable by the U.S. Government on an annual basis.  Through December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources has collected approximately $65 million from the U.S. Government pursuant to the spent fuel settlement agreement and has paid approximately $21 million to the joint owners of Duane Arnold and Seabrook.  NextEra Energy Resources will continue to pay fees to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund.  For discussion of current developments regarding a high-level nuclear waste repository see FPL - Nuclear Operations.  All of NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which should allow NextEra Energy Resources to store spent nuclear fuel at these facilities
 through license expiration.




Energy Marketing and Trading.  PMI, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electricity.  Its primary role is to manage the commodity risk of NextEra Energy Resources' portfolio.  PMI sells the output from NextEra Energy Resources' plants that has not been sold under long-term contracts.  PMI procures natural gas and oil for NextEra Energy Resources' use in power generation, as well as substantially all of the electricity needs for NextEra Energy Resources' retail electricity provider operations, conducted primarily in Texas, which at December 31, 2010 served approximately 2,180 mw of peak load to approximately 189,000 customers.  PMI
 uses derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and to optimize the value of NextEra Energy Resources' power generation assets.  PMI also provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.  Full energy and capacity requirements services include load-following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as various ancillary services.  At December 31, 2010, PMI provided full energy and capacity requirements services totaling approximately 5,820 mw of peak load in the NEPOOL, PJM, ERCOT, MISO and NYISO markets.  The results of PMI's activities are included in NextEra Energy Resources' operating results. 
; See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity, Note 1 - Energy Trading and Note 3.




Regulation.  Each of the energy markets in which NextEra Energy Resources operates is subject to local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.  At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in operating independent power projects that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Holding Company Act, which represent approximately 95% of NextEra Energy Resources' net generating capacity.  Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers.  They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers.  NextEra Energy Resources' exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from 
wind, hydropower, fossil fuels and nuclear facilities.  Essentially all of the remaining 5% of NextEra Energy Resources' net generating capacity has qualifying facility status under PURPA.  NextEra Energy Resources' qualifying facilities generate electricity from wind, solar, fossil fuels and waste coal.  Qualifying facility status exempts the projects from, among other things, many of the provisions of the Federal Power Act, as well as state laws and regulations relating to rates and financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities.  While projects with qualifying facility and/or exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.




Additionally, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) exist in a number of regions to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas.  Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers.  NextEra Energy Resources currently has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs: AESO, CAISO, ERCOT, IESO, ISONE, MISO, NYISO, PJM and SPP.  Additionally, certain NextEra Energy Resources facilities are subject to the NERC’s mandatory reliability standards, and its nucle
ar facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  See FPL - Regulation for further discussion of NERC and NRC regulations.

NextEra Energy Resources continues to evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities.  In December 2010, ERCOT implemented a locational marginal price market design (a market-pricing approach used to manage the efficient use of the transmission system when congestion occurs on the electricity grid).  NextEra Energy Resources does not anticipate a material impact, if any, on its business resulting from implementation of the new market design.




Competition.  Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary among and within geographic regions.  Revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services.  Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from regulated utilities and new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth, level of demand, environmental requirements and exposure to legal and regulatory changes.




Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NextEra Energy Resources.  Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants.




Environmental.  NextEra Energy Resources is subject to environmental laws and regulations and is affected by some of the emerging issues included in the Environmental Matters section.




During 2010, NextEra Energy Resources spent approximately $6 million on capital additions related to environmental matters, primarily to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations.  NextEra Energy Resources' capital expenditures related to environmental matters are estimated to be $5 million for 2011 through 2013, including approximately $3 million in 2011, and are included in estimated planned capital expenditures set forth in General above.




Employees.  NextEra Energy Resources and its subsidiaries had approximately 4,690 employees at December 31, 2010.  Subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have collective bargaining agreements with various unions which are summarized in the table below.

OTHER NEXTERA ENERGY OPERATIONS




NextEra Energy's Corporate and Other segment represents other business activities, primarily FPL FiberNet and Lone Star, that are not separately reportable.  See Note 15.




FPL FiberNet.  FPL FiberNet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Holdings, was formed in 2000 to enhance the value of NextEra Energy's fiber-optic network assets that were originally built to support FPL operations.  Accordingly, in 2000, FPL's existing fiber-optic lines were transferred to FPL FiberNet.  FPL FiberNet is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware.  FPL FiberNet leases wholesale fiber-optic network capacity and dark fiber to FPL and other customers, primarily telephone, wireless carriers, internet and other telecommunications companies.  FPL FiberNet's primary business focus is the Florida metropolitan (metro) market.  Metro networks cover Miami, Fort Lauderdale, We
st Palm Beach, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, Ft. Myers and Tallahassee.  FPL FiberNet also has a long-haul network within Florida that provides bandwidth at wholesale rates.  At December 31, 2010, FPL FiberNet's network consisted of approximately 4,030 route miles, which interconnect major cities throughout Florida.




At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy's investment in FPL FiberNet totaled approximately $180 million.  FPL FiberNet invested approximately $48 million during 2010 and plans to invest a total of approximately $180 million over the next five years primarily to meet customers' specific requirements under contract.

Lone Star.  In 2008, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved a $4.9 billion transmission grid improvement program that would add approximately 2,300 miles of 345 kv lines to deliver power from the Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) in west Texas and the Texas panhandle to the Dallas/Fort Worth area and other population centers in Texas.  In 2009, Lone Star, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Holdings, was allocated a portion of the transmission projects by the PUCT under the CREZ program.  Lone Star's CREZ project includes constructing and operating approximately 300 miles of 345 kv transmission lines in Texas.  In 2010, the PUCT approve
d Lone Star’s certificate of convenience and necessity, which both established Lone Star as a regulated transmission provider in Texas and granted approval to begin construction of Lone Star's CREZ project.  Lone Star is subject to the jurisdiction of the PUCT over a wide range of business activities, including, among others, rates charged to customers and certain aspects of siting, construction and operation of transmission systems.  The PUCT has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or impudently incurred.  In late 2010, Lone Star commenced right-of-way acquisition and early construction activities on its CREZ project and expects the transmission line to be placed in service in 2013.




At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy's investment in Lone Star totaled approximately $20 million. Lone Star invested approximately $20 million during 2010 and plans to invest a total of approximately $780 million, including AFUDC, during the period 2011 through 2014 for construction of the transmission line.




ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS




NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, land use, power plant and transmission line siting, EMF from power lines and substations, oil discharge from transformers, lead paint, asbestos, noise and aesthetics, solid waste, natural resources, wildlife mortality and other environmental matters.  Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of electric service by requiring, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities.  Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change.  The following
 is a discussion of emerging federal and state initiatives and rules that could potentially affect NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries, including FPL and NextEra Energy Resources.




Climate Change - The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions continue to consider several legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to GHG emissions.  The economic and operational impact of climate change legislation on NextEra Energy and FPL depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the allowed emissions, whether emission allowances will be allocated or auctioned, the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance.  If and until legislation is enacted and implementing regulations are adopted, the economic and operational impact (either positive or negative) on NextEra Energy and FPL cannot be determined, but could be ma
terial.




Meanwhile, the EPA is implementing regulatory action under the Clean Air Act to address climate change.  In 2009, the EPA issued a final endangerment finding under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act that the current and projected concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.  The final finding noted that, among other things, climate change is expected to result in an increase in electricity demand, especially supply for peak demand, a potentially adverse impact on hydropower resources as well as the potential risk of serious adverse effects on energy infrastructure from extreme weather events.  In April 2010, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions from light
 duty vehicles.  The final light duty vehicle rule applies to new passenger vehicles effective January 2011 which triggers certain permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for any new or modified stationary sources of GHG, including power plants, that exceed certain GHG emissions levels. In May 2010, the EPA released a final rule under the Clean Air Act to tailor requirements for GHG emissions which increased applicability thresholds for major sources of GHG emissions.  New facilities emitting 100,000 tons per year (tpy) or more of GHG and modifications to existing facilities resulting in an increase of GHG emissions of 75,000 tpy or more will have to perform a Best Available Control Technology review and, based on that review, may have to add additional emissions control equipment or implement energy efficiency projects.  Several petitioners have challenged the EPA’s GHG regulations and requested a stay of the rules which the D.C. Circuit denied in December 20
10.  The case is pending review by the D.C. Circuit; the timing and ultimate outcome of which is uncertain at this time.  In December 2010, the EPA announced that it will propose New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for both new or modified boilers and for existing facilities no earlier than July 2011.  The EPA plans to finalize the NSPS by May 2012.




In 2009, the EPA issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of GHG emissions from facilities with emissions of 25,000 tpy or more, which includes all of FPL's and NextEra Energy Resources' fossil plants.  Affected facilities began collecting data in January 2010 and the first emissions report is due March 31, 2011 for the 2010 period.  In December 2010, the EPA issued a final rule governing electrical transmission and distribution equipment use which requires owners/operators of electric power transmission and distribution equipment that contains a threshold volume of sulfurhexaflouride and/or perfluorocarbons to monitor such emissions from electric power transmission and distribution systems.  Affected operators, including FPL, began collecting data in January 2011 and the first emissions report is
 due March 31, 2012 for the 2011 period.

Based on the most recent reference data available from government sources, NextEra Energy is among the lowest emitters, among electric generators, of GHG in the United States measured by its rate of emissions expressed as pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) per megawatt-hour (mwh) of generation.  However, the legislative and regulatory proposals have differing methods of implementation and the impact on FPL's and NextEra Energy Resources' generating units and/or the financial impact (either positive or negative) to NextEra Energy and FPL could be material, depending on the eventual structure of any legislation enacted or specific implementation rules adopted.




In anticipation of the potential for further imposition of GHG emission limits on the electric industry in the future, NextEra Energy has taken a leadership role in the debate of climate change regulation and is involved in several climate change initiatives, including, but not limited to, the following:








·


voluntary reporting of its GHG emissions and climate change strategy through the Carbon Disclosure Project (an investor-led initiative to identify climate change impacts on publicly-traded companies);











·


participation in the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (an alliance made up of a diverse group of U.S.-based businesses and environmental organizations, which in January 2009 issued the Blueprint for Legislative Action, a set of legislative principles and recommendations to address global climate change and the reduction of GHG emissions);











·


participation in the Clinton Global Initiative (an organization which seeks to foster shared commitment by individuals, businesses and governments to confront major world issues and achieve real change);











·


participated in the EPA's Climate Leaders Program to reduce GHG intensity in the United States 18% by 2012, including reporting of emissions data annually.  During 2008, NextEra Energy met its commitment to achieve a 2008 target emissions rate reduction of 18% below a 2001 baseline emission rate measured in pounds per mwh.  This program was discontinued in 2009 by the EPA in response to the EPA's mandatory GHG reporting rule requirement;











·


supporting Edison Electric Institute's climate change framework, which supports the concept of mandatory legislation capping carbon emissions economy wide and recommends, among other things, an 80% reduction of carbon emissions from current levels by 2050; and











·


focusing on customer energy efficiency and conservation through programs such as Energy Smart Florida and EarthEra Renewable Energy Trust.







NextEra Energy Resources' plants operate in many states and regions that have developed or are in the process of developing legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including, but not limited to, the following:








·


RPS, currently in place in approximately 30 states and the District of Columbia, require electricity providers in the state or district to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources.  These standards vary, but the majority include requirements to meet 10% to 25% of the electricity providers' retail sales with energy from renewable sources by 2025.











·


The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a GHG reduction initiative whereby ten Northeast and Mid-Atlantic member states have enacted laws and adopted regulations that establish a cap-and-trade program for covered electric generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  RGGI members have agreed to stabilize power plant CO2 emissions at 2009 levels through the end of 2014 and to further reduce the sector's emissions another 10% by the end of 2018.  The RGGI GHG reduction requirements affect 12 NextEra Energy Resources' fossil electric generating units, requiring those electric generating units to reduce emissions or to acquire CO2 allowances for emis
sions of CO2.  Based on NextEra Energy Resources' clean generating portfolio in the RGGI marketplace, NextEra Energy Resources experienced a positive impact on earnings in 2009 and 2010 and expects that the requirements will have a positive overall impact on NextEra Energy Resources' earnings in 2011.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, the RGGI participating states began efforts to support the 2012 program review called for in the RGGI Memorandum of Understanding, which will be a comprehensive evaluation including program success, program impacts, additional reductions, electricity imports and associated emissions leakage, and offsets.











·


The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) is a GHG reduction initiative with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 for participants (Arizona, California, Oregon, Montana, New Mexico, Washington and Utah, as well as British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, Canada).  Due to concerns about the economic impacts of GHG reductions programs, some states and provinces are reconsidering their commitment to the WCI.











·


California Greenhouse Gas Regulation (CGGR) - California has enacted legislation to reduce GHG emissions in the state to 1990 emissions levels by 2020.  In December 2010, pursuant to the legislation, the California Air Resources Board approved a multi-sector GHG cap-and-trade program along with other GHG reduction measures which will begin in 2012.  Based on NextEra Energy Resources' clean generating portfolio in California, the impact of complying with the CGGR is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements of NextEra Energy.

Clean Air Act Mercury/Nickel Rule - Since 2005, the EPA has made several attempts to regulate nickel emissions from oil-fired generating units and mercury emissions from coal-fired generating units.  In 2008, the D.C. Circuit required the EPA to proceed with rulemaking under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to promulgate a Utility Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule by November 2011 requiring reductions of hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired and oil-fired generating units' emissions.  Depending upon the final outcome of the EPA's rulemaking, it is possible that certain oil-fired and coal-fired units at FPL and NextEra Energy Resources may be required to add additional pollution control equipment.




Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)/Clean Air Transport Rule (Transport Rule) - In 2005, the EPA published a final CAIR that requires sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reductions from electric generating units in 28 states, where the emissions from electric generating units are deemed to be transported to downwind states.  In 2008, the D.C. Circuit found significant flaws in the rule and remanded it back to the EPA for further rulemaking.  Because the D.C. Circuit chose not to vacate the rule, NextEra Energy and FPL were required to begin complying with the current version of the CAIR on January 1, 2009 and must continue to comply until the EPA rewrites the rule.
  In July 2010, the EPA released the proposed rewrite of the CAIR, known as the Transport Rule, to limit emissions of SO2 and NOx from power plants in 31 eastern states and the District of Columbia and provides for a new allocation methodology for emission allowances and revised emissions reduction limits beginning in 2012.  NextEra Energy has submitted comments on the Transport Rule to the EPA and the final rule is expected to be published no earlier than the summer of 2011.  The impact of complying with the current version of the CAIR has not had, and, along with compliance with the Transport Rule as currently proposed, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the financial statements of NextEra Energy and FPL.




Clean Air Visibility Rule - In 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule to address regional haze in areas which include certain national park and wilderness areas through the installation of BART for electric generating units.  BART eligible units include those built between 1962 and 1977 that have the potential to emit more than 250 tons of visibility-impairing pollution per year.  The rule requires states to complete BART determinations and allows for a five-year period to implement pollution controls.  The final BART requirements of the Clean Air Visibility Rule affect FPL's Turkey Point Fossil Units Nos. 1 and 2 and one of NextEra Energy Resources' units located in Maine and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on th
e financial statements of NextEra Energy or FPL.




In 2007, the FDEP began the process to expand the number of units covered under the "Reasonable Further Progress" provision of the Clean Air Visibility Rule in an effort to reduce emissions of SO2 in areas which include certain national park and wilderness areas.  In 2010, the FDEP rescinded the “Reasonable Further Progress” provision from Florida's plan to address regional haze and instead will rely on the EPA’s Transport Rule and proposed boiler MACT rules to demonstrate reasonable progress toward the visibility goals for national park and wilderness areas.




Clean Water Act Section 316(b) - In 2004, the EPA issued a rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act to address the location, design, construction and capacity of intake structures at existing power plants with once-through cooling water systems.  The rule would have required NextEra Energy to install controls or implement operational changes to reduce the impact on aquatic organisms from such water intake systems.  A number of environmental groups and six northeastern states appealed the rule and, in 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision eliminating several of the compliance alternatives, including the use of a "cost-benefit test" and restoration measures, from consideration and remanded the rule to the EPA for furth
er rulemaking.  In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of a cost-benefit test is an acceptable alternative under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act for determining the best technology available for minimizing impacts to aquatic organisms from the use of large cooling water intake systems.  The EPA is working on new rulemaking which is not expected to be proposed before the spring of 2011 with the final rule in the summer of 2012.  Depending upon the final outcome of the rulemaking by the EPA, eight of FPL's generating facilities (Cape Canaveral, Cutler, Fort Myers, Lauderdale, Port Everglades, Sanford, Riviera and St. Lucie) and three NextEra Energy Resources plants (Seabrook, Point Beach and an oil-fired plant in Maine) may be required to add additional controls or make operational changes to comply with the rule, the economic and operational impact of which cannot be determined at this time, but could be material.  Prior to the passage of a new rule, s
tates are continuing to utilize “Best Professional Judgment” in the application of Section 316(b) compliance requirements.  Through December 31, 2010, five FPL facilities undergoing permit renewals have been or may be required to install fish impingement controls with fish return systems.




Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone - In 2008, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a new standard for ground-level ozone at 75 parts per billion (ppb).  After reconsideration, in January 2010, the EPA issued a proposed revision to the NAAQS for ground-level ozone requesting comments on revising the 2008 primary standard to a more restrictive primary standard of between 60 ppb and 70 ppb. It is anticipated that the EPA will issue a final rule no earlier than the summer of 2011 which will require states to (i) identify areas which will be designated as non-attainment for ground-level ozone within 120 days of the final rule, (ii) develop plans to meet the attainment standard by 2013 and (iii) begin meeting the attainment sta
ndard between 2014 and 2031 based on non-attainment severity. Generating facilities affected by the new ozone standard may be required to install additional pollution control equipment.  A review of recent ozone monitoring data indicates that some or all of FPL's generating facilities may be located in non-attainment areas, or areas projected to be in non-attainment depending on the primary standard adopted, and some of those generating facilities may be required to install additional pollution control equipment.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors




Risks Relating to NextEra Energy's and FPL's Business




The business, financial results, financial condition and prospects of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond their control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may adversely affect the business and may cause the actual results of NextEra Energy and FPL in future periods to differ substantially from those that NextEra Energy or FPL currently expects or seeks.  Many of the risks set forth below may only apply to a portion of the businesses of subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, such as its FPL business, its wind or solar generation development businesses, its transmission business or its gas infrastructure business.  Accordingly, references to “NextEra Energy” below in some instances refer to the applicabl
e businesses or subsidiaries of NextEra Energy.  Risks specifically applicable to FPL generally include a reference to “FPL.”




NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses.








·


The operations of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation.  This extensive regulatory framework, some but not all of which is more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things, NextEra Energy's and FPL's industry, rate and cost structure, operation of nuclear power facilities, construction and operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities, decommissioning costs, transmission reliability, wholesale and retail competition, and commodities trading and derivatives transactions.  In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NextEra Energy and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their businesses and proposed changes in the regulatory framework.  Significant 
changes in the nature of the regulation of NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses could require changes to their business planning and management of their businesses and could adversely affect their financial results, including, but not limited to, the value of their assets.  NextEra Energy and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions.  Should NextEra Energy or FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on NextEra Energy or FPL, NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses could be adversely affected.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results could be negatively affected if they or their rate-regulated businesses are unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from customers through regulated rates and, in the case of FPL, cost recovery clauses.








·


FPL is a regulated entity subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including, among other items, the retail rates charged to its customers, the terms and conditions of its services, procurement of electricity for its customers, issuance of securities, transfers of some utility assets and facilities to affiliates, and aspects of the siting and operation of its generating plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy.  Lone Star, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, is a regulated entity subject to the jurisdiction of the PUCT over a wide range of business activities.  The FPSC and PUCT have the authority to disallow recovery by FPL and Lone Star, respectively, of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred.  The regulatory process, which may be adversely affected by the politic
al, regulatory and economic environment in Florida, Texas and elsewhere, can restrict NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to grow earnings and does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels.  NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery clauses or other regulatory mechanisms.











·


Decisions of the FPSC and the PUCT have been and, in the future, may be adversely affected by the local and national political, regulatory and economic environment and may adversely affect the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL.  These decisions may require, for example, NextEra Energy or FPL to cancel or delay planned development activities and to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures which could reduce the earnings potential of NextEra Energy and FPL.







NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.








·


In addition to the regulatory risks that may affect NextEra Energy and FPL described above, the extensive federal regulation of the operations of NextEra Energy and FPL exposes the companies to significant and increasing compliance costs.  NextEra Energy and FPL also are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of regulatory investigations, proceedings, settlements, decisions and claims, including, among other items, potentially significant monetary penalties for non-compliance.  As an example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NextEra Energy and FPL, as owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems and/or electric generation facilities, are subject to mandatory reliability standards.  Compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject NextEra Energy and FPL to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. &#
160;If FPL or NextEra Energy is found not to be in compliance with these standards, it may incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.




 



  



19







  



 

NextEra Energy and FPL may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.








·


From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting NextEra Energy and FPL.  Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements may result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.  Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses.  Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can also have a negative impact on the reputation of NextEra Energy and FPL and on the morale and performance of their employees, which could adver
sely affect their financial results.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses are subject to risks associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL operate in a changing market environment influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, including, for example, initiatives regarding regulation, deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry and regulation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets.  NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries will need to adapt to any changes and may face increasing costs and competitive pressures in doing so.  NextEra Energy produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable fuels, such as nuclear, natural gas and wind, operates in the competitive segment of the electric industry, has targeted the competitive segments of the electric industry for some of its future growth and relies on the efficient operation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets.  NextEra Energy’s financial results and growth prospects could be adver
sely affected as a result of new, or changes in, laws, regulations or interpretations, or other regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, those that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy industry or the effective operation of the commodities trading or derivatives markets.







NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase their cost of operations and may expose them to liabilities.

NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, extensive federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality and usage, climate change, GHG, including, but not limited to, CO2 emissions, waste management, hazardous wastes, marine, avian and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection, natural resources, health, safety and RPS that could, among other things, prevent or delay the development of power generation, power or natural gas transmission, or other infrastructure projects, restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the use of some fuels required for the production of electricity, require additional pollution control equipment, and otherwise increase costs or limit or eliminate certa
in operations.  There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations, and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations.  For example, among other potential or pending changes described elsewhere in this report, the process of hydraulic fracturing or similar technologies to drill for natural gas and related compounds used by NextEra Energy's gas infrastructure business are currently being debated for potential regulation at the state and federal levels.  Violations of current or future laws, rules and regulations could expose NextEra Energy and FPL to regulatory proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, third parties, and potentially significant civil fines, criminal penalties and other sanctions.</div

NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of GHG emissions.








·


Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on GHG, including, but not limited to, CO2 and methane, from electric generating units storing and combusting fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.  The potential effects of such GHG emission limits on NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s electric generating units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of GHG emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, a
nd the range of available compliance alternatives.  While NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s electric generating units emit GHGs at a lower rate of emissions than most of the U.S. electric generation sector, the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be adversely affected to the extent that any new GHG emission limits, among other potential impacts:







·      create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances;








  


·


make some of NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s electric generating units uneconomical to operate in the long term;











  


·


require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities; or




 



  



20







  



 





  


·


affect the availability or cost of fossil fuels.







The construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities involve risks that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear generation facilities owned by NextEra Energy or FPL and in increased costs and capital expenditures.








·


Together, FPL and NextEra Energy’s other subsidiaries own, or hold undivided interests in, eight nuclear generation units in four states.  The construction, operation and maintenance of the facilities involve inherent risks, including, but not limited to, the following:











  


·


The nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities.  Although NextEra Energy and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks, the cost of decommissioning the facilities could exceed the amount available in the decommissioning funds, and the liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage.  In the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the United States, NextEra Energy and FP
L could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.











  


·


The NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the construction of nuclear generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities, and the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities, and such requirements are subject to change.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a nuclear generation facility, or to take both of these actions, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  NRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NextEra Energy and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities.  In addition, any serious nuclear incident occurring at a NextEra Ener
gy or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility.  An incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry, which could increase costs and result in additional capital expenditures.











  


·


The operating licenses for NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s nuclear generation facilities extend through at least 2030.  If any of NextEra Energy’s or FPL’s nuclear generation units cannot be operated through the end of their respective operating licenses, NextEra Energy or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, which could adversely affect their financial results.











  


·


Terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of nuclear generation facilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs which are difficult or impossible to predict.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s operating results could suffer if they do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, generation, transmission, distribution or other facilities on schedule or within budget.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL may incur significant costs for development of projects, including, but not limited to, preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, capable of being financed or, in some cases, approved for regulatory recoveries.  The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their generation, transmission, distribution, gas infrastructure and other facilities on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rights-of-way, permits or other approvals on acceptable terms, delays in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses, permits, rights-of-way and other approvals, disputes involving contractors, labor organizati
ons, land owners and other third parties, negative publicity, transmission interconnection issues and other factors or failures.  If any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed or is delayed or subject to cost overruns, NextEra Energy's and FPL's operational and financial results may be adversely affected.  In any such event, among other matters, NextEra Energy and FPL could be subject to additional costs, which, in some cases, may not be approved for or recoverable through regulatory mechanisms, and could result in delay or termination payments and other damages under committed contracts, loss of tax credits and the write-off of their investment in the project.

The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL.








·


The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve many risks, such as those identified elsewhere in these risk factors and those arising due to:











  


·


risks of start-up operations;











  


·


failures in the supply, availability or transportation of fuel;











  


·


the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and droughts;











  


·


performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency;











  


·


breakdown or failure of equipment, transmission and distribution lines or pipelines;











  


·


availability of replacement equipment;











  


·


risks of human injury from energized equipment;











  


·


availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water discharge requirements;











  


·


inability to properly manage or mitigate known equipment defects throughout NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s generation fleets and transmission and distribution systems;











  


·


use of new or unproven technology; and











  


·


dependence on a specific fuel source.










 

The occurrence of any of these effects or events could result in, among other matters, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines, replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet contractual obligations.  Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses.  Breakdown or failure of an operating facility of NextEra Energy, for example, may prevent NextEra Energy from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in some situations, could result in termination of the agreement or subject NextEra Energy to liability for liquidated damages.  The operation and maintenance of NextEra Energy’s gas infrastructure and power transmission businesses also are subject to many of the forego
ing risks or substantially similar risks.







NextEra Energy’s competitive energy business is subject to development and operating risks that could limit the revenue growth of this business and have other negative effects on NextEra Energy’s financial results.








·


To operate successfully in the competitive wholesale energy markets, NextEra Energy must, among other things, efficiently develop and operate its generating assets, procure adequate supplies of fuel and associated transportation at acceptable prices, successfully and timely complete project restructuring activities, maintain the qualifying facility status of certain projects and complete its energy deliveries in a timely manner.  Its ability to do so is subject to a variety of risks.  In addition to risks such as those identified elsewhere in these risk factors, risks that specifically affect NextEra Energy’s success in competitive wholesale markets and in the gas infrastructure business include:











  


·


NextEra Energy may face increased competition, including, but not limited to, from other and new sources of power generation, excess generation capacity and shifting demand for power, legal and regulatory developments and general economic conditions.  Risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project agreements may impede development activities.











  


·


There can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities.  NextEra Energy’s inability or failure to hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, volumes, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures could significantly impair NextEra Energy’s financial results.











  


·


A portion of NextEra Energy’s power generation facilities operate wholly or partially without long-term power purchase agreements.  As a result, power from these facilities is sold on the spot market or on a short-term contractual basis, which may increase the volatility of NextEra Energy’s financial results.




 



  



22







  



 





  


·


NextEra Energy depends upon power transmission and natural gas transportation facilities owned and operated by others.  If transmission or transportation of sufficient power or natural gas is unavailable or disrupted, NextEra Energy’s ability to sell and deliver its wholesale power or natural gas may be limited.







NextEra Energy’s competitive energy business is dependent on continued public policy support and governmental support for renewable energy, particularly wind and solar projects.








·


NextEra Energy’s competitive energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, depends heavily on government policies that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing wind and solar energy projects.  The federal government, a majority of the 50 U.S. states and portions of Canada and Spain provide incentives, such as tax incentives, RPS or feed-in tariffs, that support the sale of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy.  The applicable legislation often grants the relevant state public utility commission the ability to reduce electric supply companies’ obligations to meet the requirements in specified circumstances.  Any reduction or elimination of existing supportive policies, including, but not limited to, RPS or feed-in tariffs, and ultimately any failure to renew or increase existing supportive policies, could result in 
less demand for generation from NextEra Energy’s wind and solar energy projects.











·


The Recovery Act includes, among other things, provisions that allow companies building wind facilities the option to choose among the following three investment cost recovery mechanisms: (1) PTCs which were extended for wind facilities placed in service prior to 2013, (2) ITCs of 30% of the cost for qualifying wind facilities placed in service prior to 2013, or (3) an election to receive a cash grant of 30% of the cost of qualifying wind facilities placed in service in 2009, 2010 or 2011, or if construction began prior to December 31, 2011 and the wind facility is placed in service prior to 2013.  An election to receive a cash grant of 30% in lieu of the 30% ITC also applies to the cost of qualifying solar facilities placed in service in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, or if construction began prior to December 31, 2011 and the solar facility is placed in service prior to 2017.  In ord
er for NextEra Energy to continue to economically develop wind and solar energy projects in the future, it will need to utilize the investment cost recovery mechanisms currently available as well as requiring similar public policy support in the future.







NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, counterparties and vendors.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers, hedging counterparties and vendors under contracts for the supply of equipment, materials, fuel and other goods and services required for their business operations and for the construction and operation of, and for capital improvements to, their facilities.  Adverse conditions in the energy industry or the general economy, as well as circumstances of individual customers, counterparties and vendors, may affect the ability of some customers, counterparties and vendors to perform as required under their contracts.  If any counterparty or vendor fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, NextEra Energy and FPL may need to make arrangements with other counterparties or vendors, which could result in higher costs, untimely completion of power generation facilities and other proj
ects, and/or a disruption of their operations.  If a defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition, NextEra Energy and FPL may not be able to recover damages for any contract breach.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results may continue to be negatively affected by slower customer growth and customer usage.








·


NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s results of operations are affected by the growth in customer accounts and by customer usage, each of which directly influences the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and power delivery facilities.  A lack of growth or slower growth in the number of retail customers or in non-weather related customer usage, such as that which has occurred over the past several years, could adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s results of operations.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NextEra Energy and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management goals, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population, job and income growth, housing starts and new business formation.  NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financi
al results may also be adversely affected by FPL’s ability to negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.  As a result, NextEra Energy and FPL may make, but not fully realize the anticipated benefits from, significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect their financial results.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results are subject to risks associated with weather conditions, such as the impact of severe weather.








·


NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results can be negatively affected by changes in the weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities, including, but not limited to, wind, solar and hydro-powered facilities.  For example, the level of wind resource affects the results of operations of wind generating facilities.  Since the levels of wind, solar and hydro resources are variable and difficult to predict, NextEra Energy’s results of operations for individual wind, solar and hydro facilities vary or may vary significantly from period to period depending on the level of available resources.  To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the returns from these 
facilities may be less than expected.




 



  



23







  



 





·


In addition, NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results would be affected by the impact of severe weather, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, which can be destructive and cause power outages and property damage, reduce revenue, affect fuel supply, and require NextEra Energy and FPL to incur additional costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities.  As a company that provides electric service throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida, FPL operates in an area that historically has been more prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes.  A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado, or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NextEra Energy and FPL from operating their busines
ses in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above.  At FPL and other regulated businesses of NextEra Energy, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred would result in a negative financial impact on NextEra Energy and FPL.







Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may negatively affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NextEra Energy and FPL and exert downward pressure on the market price of NextEra Energy’s common stock.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets, such as conditions that have existed in the recent past, could increase NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s cost of capital.  If NextEra Energy or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to grow its businesses and could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flexibility.  The market price and trading volume of NextEra Energy’s common stock are subject to fluctuations
 as a result of, among other factors, general stock market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business, growth prospects and financing strategies of NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries.











·


Although NextEra Energy’s competitive energy subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific financing in the past, market conditions and other factors could adversely affect the future availability of such financing.  The inability of NextEra Energy’s subsidiaries to access the capital and credit markets to provide project-specific financing for electric-generating and other energy facilities on favorable terms, whether because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise, could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by NextEra Energy and/or Capital Holdings in the future.











·


The inability of subsidiaries that have existing project-specific financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, might result in the specific project, and potentially in some limited instances its parent companies, being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral, any of which actions could negatively affect NextEra Energy’s financial results, as well as the availability or terms of future financings for NextEra Energy or its subsidiaries.







NextEra Energy’s, Capital Holdings’ and FPL’s inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s liquidity, limit the ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to grow their businesses, and increase interest costs, while the liquidity of the companies also could be impaired by the inability of their credit providers to maintain their current credit ratings or to fund their credit commitments.








·


The inability of NextEra Energy, Capital Holdings and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, which, in turn, could impact NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to grow their businesses and service indebtedness and repay borrowings, and would likely increase their interest costs.  Some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are cash flows, liquidity, the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization, and political, legislative and regulatory actions.  There can be no assurance that one or more of the ratings of NextEra Energy, Capital Holdings and FPL will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.











·


The inability of NextEra Energy’s, Capital Holdings’ and FPL’s credit providers to maintain credit ratings acceptable under various agreements, or to fund their credit commitments, could require NextEra Energy, Capital Holdings or FPL, among other things, to renegotiate requirements in agreements, find an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements, or post cash collateral.




 



  



24







  



 

The use of derivative contracts by NextEra Energy and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that could adversely affect their financial results and liquidity.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, some of which are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets or on exchanges, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and for NextEra Energy to engage in trading and marketing activities.  NextEra Energy could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these derivative instruments or if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments under these derivative instruments.  NextEra Energy also could suffer a reduction in operating cash flows as a result of the requirement to post margin cash collateral.  In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments involves management’s judgment or use of estimates.  Although NextEra Energy and FP
L execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on the most favorable credit and market execution factors, there is greater volatility and less liquidity in transactions executed in OTC markets and, as a result, NextEra Energy and FPL may not be able to execute such transactions in times of market volatility.  As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments.  In addition, FPL’s use of such instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found imprudent, could result in disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the FPSC.











·


NextEra Energy provides full energy and capacity requirement services, which include, for example, load-following services and various ancillary services, primarily to distribution utilities to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities’ power supply obligations to their customers.  The supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events that may occur after NextEra Energy has committed to supply power, such as weather conditions, fluctuating prices for energy and ancillary services, and the ability of the distribution utilities’ customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers.  If the supply costs are not favorable, NextEra Energy’s operating costs could increase and adversely affect its results of operations.











·


NextEra Energy is an active participant in energy markets.  The liquidity of regional energy markets is an important factor in the company's ability to manage risks in these operations.  Over the past several years, other market participants have ceased or significantly reduced their activities in energy markets as a result of several factors, including, but not limited to, government investigations, changes in market design, and deteriorating credit quality.  Liquidity in the energy markets can be adversely affected by price volatility, restrictions on the availability of credit, and other factors.  As a result, reductions in liquidity may restrict the ability of NextEra Energy to manage its risks, and this could negatively affect NextEra Energy’s financial results.











·


NextEra Energy and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms, that may not work as planned.  Risk management tools and metrics such as daily value at risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines are based on historical price movements.  If price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, the risk management tools may not protect against significant losses.  As a result of these and other factors, NextEra Energy and FPL cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their financial results and liquidity.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act broaden the scope of its provisions regarding the regulation of OTC financial derivatives and make them applicable to NextEra Energy and FPL.








·


The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 which, among other things, provides for the regulation of the OTC derivatives market.  While the legislation is broad and detailed, substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the SEC and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  NextEra Energy and FPL cannot predict the final rules that will be adopted to implement the OTC derivatives market provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Those rules could negatively affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks, which could have a material adverse effect on NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results.  The rules also could require NextEra Energy Resources to restructure part of its energy marketing a
nd trading operations or to discontinue certain portions of its business.  In addition, if the rules require NextEra Energy and FPL to post cash collateral with respect to swap transactions, NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and their ability to enter into OTC derivatives to hedge commodity and interest rate risks could be significantly limited.  Reporting and compliance requirements of the rules also could significantly increase operating costs and expose NextEra Energy and FPL to penalties for non-compliance.







NextEra Energy’s ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.








·


NextEra Energy is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the power industry in general.  In addition, NextEra Energy may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.




 



  



25







  



 

NextEra Energy may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or if NextEra Energy is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.








·


NextEra Energy is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own.  Substantially all of NextEra Energy’s consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries.  NextEra Energy’s ability to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the subsidiaries’ net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NextEra Energy.  The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy before they can fund NextEra Energy.  NextEra Energy’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide NextEra Energy with funds for its payment obligations.  
In addition, the dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements.  The future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of NextEra Energy's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.  NextEra Energy guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with Capital Holdings.  These guarantees may require NextEra Energy to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when NextEra Energy is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations or to pay dividends.  In addition, in the event of a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization, NextEra Energy’s right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’
s creditors.







Changes in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results, financial condition and liquidity.








·


NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities requires significant judgments and the use of estimates.  Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, financial condition and results of operations of NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, FPL, as well as the resolution of audit issues r
aised by taxing authorities.  Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities which could negatively affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results, financial condition and liquidity.







NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to their reputation and/or the financial results of the retail business.








·


NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business.  NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s retail businesses may also need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center services, to the retail businesses.  If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of NextEra Energy and FPL could be adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, customer information could be used for identity theft purposes, NextEra Energy and FPL would be subject to costs associated with the breach and/or NextEra Energy and FPL could be subject to fines and legal claims, any of which may hav
e a negative impact on the businesses and/or NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results.







A failure in NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair their liquidity, disrupt their businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect their financial results.








·


NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses are highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, and cross numerous and diverse markets.  Due to the size, scope and geographical reach of NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses, and due to the complexity of the process of power generation, transmission and distribution, the development and maintenance of NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s operational systems and infrastructure is challenging.  NextEra Energy's and FPL’s operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are either within, or wholly or partially outside, their control, such as operator error, severe weather or terrorist activities.  Any such failure or disabling event could adversely affec
t NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to process transactions and provide services, and their financial results and liquidity.




 



  



26







  



 






·


NextEra Energy and FPL add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis.  Modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks, including, but not limited to, integrating the modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls, and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent.  Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies’ control environment, and/or the compani
es’ ability to timely file required regulatory reports.












·


NextEra Energy and FPL also face the risks of operational failure, termination, or capacity constraints of third parties, including, but not limited to, those who provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services.







Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact the operations of NextEra Energy and FPL in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results and liquidity.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities.  Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenue
s and significant additional costs to repair and insure NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s assets, and could adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.











·


NextEra Energy and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to such activities.  If NextEra Energy’s or FPL’s technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, NextEra Energy and FPL would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results.











·


The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s reputation among customers and the public.











·


A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s businesses.  Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, NextEra Energy and FPL face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s systems or within a neighboring system.  Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s financial results.







The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.








·


The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting their businesses, as well as by international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NextEra Energy and FPL.  A loss for which NextEra Energy and FPL are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect their financial results.  NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the companies may be subject.

The businesses and financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be negatively affected by the lack of a qualified workforce, work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL may not be able effectively and profitably to obtain new customers, or grow their customer base, service existing customers and meet their other business plan goals if they do not attract and retain a qualified workforce.  The lack of a qualified workforce, including, for example, the loss or retirement of key executives and other employees, may adversely affect service and productivity and contribute to higher training and safety costs.  Over the next several years, a significant portion of NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s workforce, including, but not limited to, many workers with specialized skills maintaining and servicing the nuclear generation facilities and electrical infrastructure, will be eligible to retire.  Such highly skilled individuals may not be able to be replaced quickly due to the technically complex work they perform.  Pers
onnel costs also may increase due to inflationary or competitive pressures on payroll and benefits costs and revised terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees.  Employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of customers and revenue.







Poor market performance and other economic factors could affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s nuclear decommissioning funds’ asset value or defined benefit pension plan’s funded status, which may adversely affect NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s liquidity and financial results.








·


NextEra Energy and FPL are required to maintain decommissioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power plants.  In addition, NextEra Energy sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries.  A decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds or in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Moreover, NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates, since, as interest rates decrease the funding liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefits costs and funding requirements.  Any increase in benefits costs or funding requirements may have an adverse effect
 on NextEra Energy’s and FPL’s liquidity and financial results.







Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results.








·


The costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  NextEra Energy and FPL believe that their employee benefit costs, including, but not limited to, costs related to health care plans for employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with NextEra Energy's and FPL's health care plans may adversely affect the companies' financial results.







The factors described above, as well as other information set forth in this report, which could materially adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's businesses, financial condition, future financial results and/or liquidity should be carefully considered.  The risks described above are not the only risks facing NextEra Energy and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely affect NextEra Energy's or FPL's business, financial condition, future financial results and/or liquidity.
