Item 1A.    Risk Factors                    Our business is subject to many risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face. For the convenience of the reader, the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply, but they may also apply to other categories.Competitive and Reputational RisksOur continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Target which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members.We believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at Target, our team members choose Target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies: guests, team members, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of Target's reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. While reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. Those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, lost sales, loss of new store and technology development opportunities, or team member retention and recruiting difficulties. For example, we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013, and while we now believe the incident will not have a long-term impact to our relationship with our guests, it is an example of an incident that affected our reputation and negatively impacted our sales for a period of time. In addition, the long-term reputational impact of discontinuing our Canadian operations on our guests, team members, vendors and other constituencies is unknown, and we may need to take actions that could increase our expenses and adversely affect the results of our operations.If we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs and marketing efforts. Our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers. Guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, the functionality and reliability of our digital channels, our in-stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margins, and expenses.We sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands. These brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales. If one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected.The continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers. In particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real-time product availability using digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price, the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel; providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use; working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise; and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price-match policy. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors in response to these efforts, or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels, content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and, as a result, have an adverse effect on sales, gross margins, and expenses.5If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our guests, our sales, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others). Our guests are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. We currently provide full and mobile versions of our website (Target.com), offer applications for mobile phones and tablets, and interact with our guests through social media. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our omnichannel retailing efforts include implementing new technology, software  and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers, which is extremely complex and may not meet guest expectations for timely and accurate deliveries. If we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our omnichannel efforts, implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology in a timely manner, allow real-time and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase, quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if Target.com and our other guest‑facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests, reliably function as designed, or maintain the privacy of guest data, or if we are unable consistently meet our brand promise to our guests, we may experience a loss of guest confidence, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margins and profitability could suffer.A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories, including apparel, home décor, seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. For example, we are investing more of our overall resources, including capital, marketing, and product development to focus on signature categories, including baby, kids, wellness, and style, and tailor our food assortment to support guest wellness goals and become more specialized with unique and differentiated items. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, emphasize the correct categories, and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales, spoilage, and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales, gross margins, and profitability.Technology Investments and Infrastructure RisksIf our capital investments in technology, new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns, our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.Our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments, and the returns on these investments are less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores. We are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts, implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology, and evolve our inventory management system, information processes, and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests. These technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. In addition, our growth also depends, in part, on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Many of our expected new store sites are smaller and non-standard footprints located in fully developed markets, which are generally more time-consuming and expensive undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.6A significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence.We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process guest transactions, manage and maintain the privacy of guest data, communicate with our vendors and other third parties, service REDcard accounts, and summarize and analyze results, and on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet to use our computer systems. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions, and encounter lost guest confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The Data Breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 negatively impacted our ability to handle customer inquiries, and we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach. Similarly, we experienced a temporary network disruption not involving a data breach in June 2014 that prevented many of our point-of-sale registers from working in a limited geographic region. This disruption caused checkout delays and generated negative publicity, and we engaged in promotional activities to retain our customers during the delay.We continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems. Implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency, and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence.Data Security and Privacy RisksIf our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests, team members and vendors are unsuccessful, we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our sales and reputation could suffer.An important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests, team members, and vendors. We have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, and temporary staff. Until the Data Breach in the fourth quarter of 2013, all incidents we experienced were insignificant. The Data Breach we experienced was significant and went undetected for several weeks. Both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents other than the Data Breach; however, to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. If we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our REDcards or pharmacy services, or stop shopping with us altogether.We have recorded significant expenses related to the Data Breach. Our losses could exceed the amounts we have recorded by material amounts, and these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.The Data Breach we experienced was significant, went undetected for several weeks, and involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network. We experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach, and we are currently facing litigation seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. In addition, state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. The governmental agencies investigating the Data Breach may seek to impose on us fines and/or other monetary relief and/or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. Furthermore, three of the four major 7payment card networks, which between them represent a substantial majority of the payment cards potentially impacted by the Data Breach, have made written claims against us, either directly or through our acquiring banks, and we believe that it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make a claim against us. Collectively, the claims, investigations and other possible consequences of the Data Breach may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations. In the future we may be subject to additional investigations and claims of this sort. We have recorded Data Breach-related expenses that include our estimated probable losses for these matters, and it is reasonably possible that we may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued.Supply Chain and Third Party RisksInterruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network, increased commodity, supply chain and fulfillment costs, or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses and results of operations.We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner. As we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, the outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the labor disputes impacting the ports on the west coast of the U.S. that began in 2014 have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory, and if these disputes recur or worsen, it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply. Changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain, including vendor costs, labor, fuel, tariffs, currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives, could have an adverse effect on gross margins, expenses and results of operations. Changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations. We are unable to determine whether our decision to discontinue our Canadian operations will negatively impact our relationships with vendors that also supply our U.S. operations in a way that might cause less favorable terms, increased costs, result in less timely and efficient deliveries, or impact their ability to sell to Target.A disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations.We rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions, including portions of our technology development and systems, our digital platforms and distribution network operations, credit and debit card transaction processing, extensions of credit for our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, and aspects of our clinic and pharmacy operations. If we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, our reputation, sales, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services in-house.Legal, Regulatory, Global and Other External RisksOur earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States.Virtually all of our sales are in the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins. 8These same considerations impact the success of our credit card program. Even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with TD. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments. Weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns, which alone or together with natural disasters, particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated, could adversely affect our results of operations.Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. In addition, our three largest states by total sales are California, Texas and Florida, areas where natural disasters are more prevalent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores, distribution centers or key vendors, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, stores, and directly to guests, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales.We rely on a large, global and changing workforce of Target team members, contractors and temporary staffing. If we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.With approximately 347,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business changes. Many team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, collective bargaining efforts, health care and other benefit costs, changing demographics, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors and temporary staffing, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations. As of March 13, 2015, none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements. We are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts. If we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business.We maintain a headquarters location in India where there has been greater political, financial, environmental and health instability than the United States. An extended disruption of our operations in India could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channels and information technology development.Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children’s products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests.Our failure to comply with federal, state, local, and international laws, or changes in these laws could increase our costs, reduce our margins, and lower our sales.Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate. Significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment 9affecting Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety, payment methods and related fees, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. For example, we are currently facing government inquiries related to the Data Breach that may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties. In addition, any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the recent retail-industry data breaches could increase or accelerate our compliance costs. Also, our pharmacy and clinic operations are governed by various regulations, and a significant change in, or our noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our compliance costs and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs, reducing our margins, and lowering our sales.Financial RisksChanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income.A number of factors influence our effective income tax rate, including changes in tax law, tax treaties, interpretation of existing laws, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. Changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our net income. In addition, our operations outside of the United States may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could suffer.We are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. In particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong debt ratings. If rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs, and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.If we are unable to make a fair and orderly exit of our Canadian operations, or if our existing reserves are not adequate to cover our ultimate liability, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.On January 15, 2015, we announced our decision to discontinue our Canadian operations and authorized a filing by our direct wholly owned subsidiary, Target Canada Co., and certain other subsidiaries under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada). During the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2015, we reported pretax losses from our discontinued Canadian operations, including pretax exit losses, a non-cash pretax impairment charge, and other operating losses. The losses from discontinued operations include probable losses relating to certain claims that may be asserted against us as a result of our guaranty of certain obligations of Target Canada Co. or other claims that may be made against us. Our reserves relating to these matters may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability, and amounts beyond our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may suffer other losses for which we have not established reserves, although we believe that possibility is not probable. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently execute the wind-down of our Canadian operations, we may incur additional costs and cash outflows. Item 1B
