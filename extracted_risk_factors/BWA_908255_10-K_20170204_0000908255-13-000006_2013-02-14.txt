The Engine Group's products include: turbochargers, timing devices and chains, emissions systems, thermal systems, diesel cold start, gasoline ignition technology and cabin heaters. The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light, commercial and off-highway applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  The Engine Group has greatly benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe.  This growth is linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles, which typically use turbochargers, and for turbocharged gasoline engines.  Benefits of turbochargers in light, commercial and off-highway applications include increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.4  Table of Contents   Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles represented approximately 26% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company currently supplies light vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including  BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, PSA, Renault and Volkswagen. The Company also supplies commercial vehicle turbochargers to Daimler, Deutz, MAN and Navistar and off-highway turbochargers to Caterpillar and John Deere.The Company's newest turbocharger technologies are its regulated two-stage turbocharging system, known as R2S®, regulated 3-stage turbocharging systems ("R3S"), variable turbine geometry ("VTG") turbochargers and turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines, all of which may be found in numerous applications around the world. For example, the Company supplies its award winning R2S® turbocharger technology to Volkswagen's 2.0 liter four-cylinder common-rail diesel engine featured in the Transporter T5 and Amarok pickup and its R3S turbocharger system, an industry first, to BMW for its new high-powered 3.0 liter diesel engine. Also, the Company supplies VTG turbochargers to Renault's 1.6 liter R9M diesel engine featured in the Mégane Scénic and to Great Wall for its 2.0 liter diesel engine. Ford selected BorgWarner's leading gasoline turbocharger technology for its new 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engines, the latter of which launched in the U.S. in the 2012 Explorer and 2012 Edge models and in China in the Ford Mondeo.The Engine Group's timing systems products include timing chain, variable cam timing (“VCT”), crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO® front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain for light vehicles.The Company is a leading manufacturer of timing chain systems to OEMs around the world.

VCT with mid position lock made its debut on Subaru's Boxer® 2.0 liter engine. BorgWarner is currently working with a number of other OEMs interested in implementing this technology.  The Company is a leading manufacturer of chain for drivetrain systems. The Company's HY-VO® chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the drivetrain in FWD transmissions and also in 4WD transfer cases, which distributes power between a vehicle's front and rear wheels.The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to control emissions and improve fuel economy. These products include electric air pumps, turbo actuators using integrated electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio and exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") coolers, tubes and valves for gasoline and diesel applications. In 2010, the Company acquired Dytech Ensa S.L., a leading producer of EGR coolers, EGR tubes and integrated EGR modules including valves for light, commercial and off-highway applications.The Company is a leading global provider of engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway applications. The Engine Group designs, manufactures and markets viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling systems. The Company's thermal products provide improved vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at several major global heavy truck producers.5  Table of Contents   The Company is a leading global automotive supplier of diesel cold start technology (glow plugs and instant starting systems), including its Pressure Sensor Glow Plug which monitors and enhances the combustion process of a diesel engine, minimizing CO2 and NOx emissions. The Company also designs and manufactures gasoline ignition technology and electronic control units and sensor technology (diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors).In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.In 2010, in anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co. KG. The former 50/50 joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop and manufacture electric cabin heaters.The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies.DrivetrainThe Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic transmission components and modules and is a supplier to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world for conventional automatic, dual clutch transmissions (“DCT”), automated manual transmissions and continuously variable transmissions. In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven and eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth opportunities. Friction and mechanical products include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China. The Company has led the globalization of today's DCT technology for over 10 years. Following the development of its DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its award-winning DualTronic® innovations with VW/Audi. In 2007, the Company launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan. The Company has announced DCT programs with customers that include VW/Audi, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT programs with BMW, Ford and other global automakers. The Company is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world. BorgWarner DualTronic® technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and great driving experience of a manual gearbox.In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The joint venture's operations are located in Dalian, China and production is scheduled to begin in 2013. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture.6  Table of Contents   The Drivetrain Group's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/all-wheel drive ("AWD") transfer case systems, FWD/AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Company's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit vehicle dynamics, fuel economy and stability. Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles (“CUVs”), and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Company's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD®), chain-driven, gear-driven, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Company's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks.The Company is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as traction is required. The Company's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (“CEH”) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD/AWD vehicles including the Audi A3, Skoda Octavia,Volvo XC60 and VW Golf.In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition will continue to add industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products. This enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs. 7  Table of Contents   Joint VenturesAs of December 31, 2012, the Company had nine joint ventures in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from the six joint ventures in which the Company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the Company's results. Results from the three joint ventures in which the Company's effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by the Company using the equity method of accounting.Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the Company's respective joint venture partners.

Turbo Energy Limited’s sales are reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2012.(b)The Company made purchases from Turbo Energy Limited totaling $24.2 million, $22.5 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.(c)BorgWarner Inc. owns 50% of NSK-Warner, which has a 40% interest in BorgWarner Transmission Systems Korea Ltd. This gives the Company an additional indirect effective ownership percentage of 20%. This results in a total effective ownership interest of 80%.Financial Information About Geographic AreasDuring the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 74% of the Company's consolidated net sales were outside the United States ("U.S."), attributing sales to the location of production rather than the location of the customer. Refer to Note 17, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas. Product Lines and CustomersDuring the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 80% of the Company's net sales were for light-vehicle applications; approximately 9% were for commercial vehicle applications; approximately 6% were for off-highway vehicle applications; and approximately 5% were to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts. 8  Table of Contents   The Company’s worldwide net sales to the following customers (including their subsidiaries) were approximately as follows: Year Ended December 31,Customer2012 2011 2010Volkswagen17% 19% 19%Ford13% 12% 11%No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in any of the years  presented.The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.Sales and MarketingEach of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit's products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers.In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities for the business units. The development of DualTronic®, the Company's wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.SeasonalityOur operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.Research and DevelopmentThe Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses.In addition, each of the Company's business units within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (“R&D”) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.9  Table of Contents   By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.  Year Ended December 31,(millions of dollars)2012 2011 2010Gross R&D expenditures$309.3 $294.7 $233.2Customer reimbursements(43.4) (51.0) (48.2)Net R&D expenditures$265.9 $243.7 $185.0Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 3.7%, 3.4% and  3.3% in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded 5% of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.Intellectual PropertyThe Company has more than 4,200 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's business.  CompetitionThe Company's reporting segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Technological innovation, application engineering development, quality, price, delivery and program launch support are the primary elements of competition.10  Table of Contents   The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:Product Type: Engine Names of CompetitorsTurbochargers: Cummins Turbo Technology IHI  Honeywell Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)     Emissions systems: Behr Modine  Denso Pierburg     Timing devices and chains: Denso Schaeffler Group  Iwis Tsubaki Group     Thermal systems: Behr Usui  Horton/Sachs Xuelong     Diesel cold start, gasoline ignition Bosch Eberspacher Catemtechnology and cabin heaters: Delphi NGK Product Type: Drivetrain Names of CompetitorsTorque transfer: American Axle JTEKT  GKN Driveline Magna Powertrain     Transmission: Bosch FCC  Dynax Schaeffler GroupIn addition, a number of the Company's major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products that compete with the Company's products. Other current OEM customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company's business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.For many of its products, the Company's competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. Also, see .    Risk Factors     The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Risks related to our industryConditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse affect on our sales to OEMs.14  Table of Contents   We face strong competition.We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Although OEMs have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our business.Risks related to our businessWe are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products.There is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Annual price reductions to OEM customers have become a permanent feature of our business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. Inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.We continue to face highly volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.  We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases. The discontinuation of our ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business. From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers.  If these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business.15  Table of Contents   We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.  We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position. We are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems.To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations.  If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide.  Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.Part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.As of December 31, 2012, approximately 20% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires in September 2016. The workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. A prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.We are impacted by the rising cost of providing retirement benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded.We sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations, if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, our required cash payments may be higher than we expect.   16  Table of Contents   We are subject to extensive environmental regulations.Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. Costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.We have contingent liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other claims.We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws.We provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability, environmental and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance.Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions, which are inherently uncertain. Negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or changes to tax laws governing the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our business.17  Table of Contents   Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.We have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components; and (d) the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost affectively. Failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.We are subject to risks related to our international operations.We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the Americas, Europe and Asia. For 2012, approximately 74% of our sales were outside the U.S. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive. A downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded.  The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement.  Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.Risks related to our customersWe rely on sales to major customers.We rely on sales to OEMs around the world of varying credit quality. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the Company. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to any of a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2012 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of our 2012 consolidated net sales.    18  Table of Contents   We are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations.All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at OEMs' facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse affect on our business.Risks related to our suppliersWe could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations. However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, “Acts of God," or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely affect our customer relations and business.Suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business. We are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers.The Company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers' compensation claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services. These service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company's business.  Insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business.We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.19  Table of Contents   Other risksA variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of natural disasters.Item 1B
