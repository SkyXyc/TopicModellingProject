ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSRISK FACTORSInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially.  In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Our ProductsA majority of our revenues are due to sales of INCIVEK (telaprevir) in the United States, and our future revenues from INCIVEK are expected to decline.In 2012, 87% of our total net product revenues were attributable to INCIVEK.  Our net product revenues from sales of INCIVEK declined over the course of 2012.  While we expect INCIVEK net product revenues to decline in 2013 as compared to 2012, we cannot accurately predict the extent of this decline.  If our INCIVEK net product revenues, market share and/or other information regarding sales of INCIVEK do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline. The number and type of treatments for HCV infection has and likely will continue to change rapidly.  Factors that may affect the market for any specific HCV treatment regimen, including INCIVEK triple-combination therapy, include the introduction of new competitive drugs or drug combinations, increased sales from currently approved drugs, adverse information regarding the safety characteristics or efficacy of the regimen, significant new information regarding potential treatment regimens being evaluated in clinical trials and enrollment by patients in clinical trials being conducted by us or our competitors.  We believe the decreases in INCIVEK net product revenues that we experienced in 2012 are the result of a combination of factors, including the safety and efficacy data that have been reported by our competitors regarding treatment regimens for HCV infection that may become commercially available over the next several years. We market INCIVEK in direct competition with Merck & Co., Inc.'s VICTRELIS (boceprevir), another HCV protease inhibitor that was approved for sale in 2011.  Since INCIVEK's approval in 2011, many companies have continued to pursue the development of treatment regimens for HCV infection that could potentially offer improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, including shorter duration therapies, therapies that do not require the administration of peg-IFN, and therapies that do not cause side effects seen with the currently approved HCV protease inhibitors.  Many companies are investigating combination regimens that incorporate one or more of an HCV protease inhibitor, an HCV nucleotide analogue, an HCV non-nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or an NS5A inhibitor, each of which inhibit HCV viral replication through different mechanisms of action.  Clinical trials of these investigational combination regimens are being conducted in a wide variety of patient populations, including treatment-naïve and treatment-failure patients, and across all HCV genotypes, which respond differently to different combinations of molecules employing different mechanisms. On the basis of clinical data reported by our competitors from numerous late-stage clinical trials, it appears likely that future improvements in HCV treatment regimens will come stepwise, with the next group of drugs to be approved for administration in combination with peg-IFN and RBV, followed quickly by drugs to be co-administered in all-oral regimens that do not require peg-IFN, an injectable.  Gilead's GS-7977, an HCV nucleotide analogue, and Janssen's TMC435, an HCV protease inhibitor, have been evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials.  The top-line results reported by Gilead and Janssen from these Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that the safety and efficacy profiles of GS-7977 and TMC435 will position them, if approved, to potentially take a significant portion of the market for HCV therapies.  While it is difficult to estimate regulatory timelines and the response of regulatory agencies to submissions for marketing approval, we believe it is likely that GS-7977-based and/or TMC435-based treatment regimens will be approved in one or more markets as a treatment for genotype 1 HCV infection in late 2013 or 2014.  In addition to the HCV treatment regimens that are being developed in combination with peg-IFN and RBV, many all-oral treatment regimens for HCV infection are in development that could render uncompetitive current and future treatment regimens that include the administration of peg-IFN by injection.  We are planning to evaluate all-oral treatment regimens that include our HCV nucleotide analogue, VX-135, in Phase 2 clinical trials.  Some of our competitors' potential all-oral treatment regimens are more advanced, including all-oral treatment regimens that are being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical 30Table of Contentstrials being conducted by Gilead and Abbvie, Inc.  While the development and regulatory timelines for these drug candidates are subject to risk and uncertainty, we believe that (i) substantial additional clinical data regarding potential all-oral treatment regimens will become available in 2013 and (ii) it is possible that one or more all-oral treatment regimens for genotype 1 HCV infection could be commercially available as soon as late 2014.  As a result, if we are successful in developing all-oral treatment regimens that include VX-135 and/or VX-222, independently or with a collaborator, it is likely that our all-oral treatment regimens would compete directly with one or more previously approved all-oral treatment regimens.If one or more treatment regimens with a similar or better efficacy, safety and/or tolerability profile than our telaprevir-based treatment regimen, is approved, we expect that INCIVEK would lose a significant portion of its share of the genotype 1 HCV infection treatment market.   Our future revenues from KALYDECO monotherapy are dependent, among other factors, on the outcomes of reimbursement discussions in international markets and ongoing clinical trials in which we are evaluating ivacaftor in additional patient groups.  In 2012, we obtained approval to market KALYDECO (ivacaftor) in the United States, Canada and the European Union for the treatment of patients with CF six years of age and older with the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene.  Since its approval in the first quarter of 2012, most eligible patients in the United States have initiated and are receiving treatment with KALYDECO.  We are in discussions regarding reimbursement for KALYDECO in multiple international markets.  In France and Germany, we began commercial sales of KALYDECO in 2012, but we are continuing to discuss the reimbursement rate we will receive for KALYDECO in future periods.  Funding for KALYDECO has been recommended in England and Ireland, and we anticipate that reimbursement in these countries will begin in the second quarter of 2013.  In other countries, we must first complete the reimbursement discussions before we commence commercial sales.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, obtain on a timely basis, or maintain appropriate reimbursement for KALYDECO in these international markets.  In order to expand the market for ivacaftor monotherapy, we will need to demonstrate that ivacaftor is safe and effective in additional patient populations.  We are conducting three Phase 3 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate ivacaftor as a monotherapy in additional patient populations, including patients younger than six years of age with gating mutations and patients with other mutations in the CFTR gene.  These clinical trials are subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that are described in these risk factors with respect to the development of our drug candidates.  Even if these clinical trials are successful, we do not expect that we would obtain approval for the use of ivacaftor in additional populations until 2014 or later.We cannot predict the royalty revenues we will receive based on INCIVO sales by Janssen in its territories.Janssen began marketing INCIVO (telaprevir) in the second half of 2011, and we earned $117.6 million in royalty revenues on net sales of INCIVO by Janssen in 2012.  In addition to the factors that contribute to the uncertainty of sales of INCIVEK (telaprevir) by us in the United States, which apply equally to Janssen’s sales in its territories, sales in Janssen’s territories are dependent upon Janssen’s sales and marketing efforts, which we do not control and may not be able to effectively influence, and the actions and decisions of foreign regulatory authorities.  We cannot predict the royalty revenues that we will recognize in future periods from sales of INCIVO by Janssen or the timing of such revenues.If our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.INCIVEK, KALYDECO and any drugs we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors.  There are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing.  In order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, and ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs.  Many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as Abbvie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer,  Sanofi and Roche, possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess.We are aware of a number of companies that are developing new treatments for HCV infection, including HCV nucleotide analogues, HCV protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors and HCV NS5A inhibitors.  Although drug development is a lengthy process and involves a high degree of risk, we expect that over the next several years 31Table of Contentsseveral of these competitive HCV drug candidates may be approved as part of treatment regimens for HCV infection in the United States and elsewhere in the world.  As a result, the commercial prospects for INCIVEK, and VX-135 and VX-222, if approved, will depend on, among other factors:•the efficacy, safety, tolerability and other characteristics of any combination therapy including INCIVEK, VX-135 and/or VX-222 relative to existing and future treatments for HCV infection;•our ability to establish VX-135 and/or VX-222, if approved, or INCIVEK as a significant component of any commercially competitive all-oral therapy for the treatment of HCV infection; and•the clinical data obtained and timing of marketing approvals for drug candidates being developed by our competitors, including any all-oral therapy or shorter duration therapy for the treatment of HCV infection.One or more competing therapies for the treatment of HCV infection may be approved in late 2013 or 2014 with a similar or better efficacy, safety and/or tolerability profile than our telaprevir-based treatment regimen, which would negatively affect INCIVEK and INCIVO sales and could negatively affect our business and financial condition.A number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of CF, including Novartis, Pfizer, Genzyme and several private companies.  We believe our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action with the goal of addressing the underlying cause of CF.  While we believe that it will be several years before any of these competitive programs enter late-stage clinical development, if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with CF, our revenues from KALYDECO and/or other compounds, if then approved, could face competitive pressures.If we discover safety issues with either of our products that were not known at the time of approval or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.Our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information.  Drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side-effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies.  For example, in December 2012, we updated the INCIVEK label in the United States to include a Boxed Warning stating that fatal and non-fatal serious skin reactions have been reported in patients taking INCIVEK combination treatment.  The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market.  The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.If we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions.  In addition, the manufacturers we engage to make our products and the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made are subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.  If problems are identified during the review or inspection of these manufacturers or manufacturing facilities, it could result in our inability to use the facility to make our product or a determination that inventories are not safe for commercial sale.If physicians, patients and third-party payors do not accept our drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenues in future periods.Our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients.  Effectively marketing INCIVEK and KALYDECO, and any of our other drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval.  Physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them, for a variety of reasons including:32Table of Contents•lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to other drugs;•prevalence and severity of adverse side-effects;•lack of cost-effectiveness;•lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors;•a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our applicable drug;•convenience and ease of administration;•other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and•ineffective marketing and/or distribution support.If our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.Government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means.  If they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors.  Third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.  Governments and other third-party payors seek to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means, and in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control.  In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control.  The ACA requires discounts under the Medicare drug benefit program and increases the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by Medicaid.  In addition, the ACA imposes an annual fee, which will increase annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs.  As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products.  We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other future products to such payors’ satisfaction.  Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management’s time and financial and other resources.  Our products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective.  Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in the data used to calculate these rates.  Net prices for products are reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs and privately-negotiated discounts.  While we have implemented policies in an effort to comply with mandated reimbursement rates, the U.S. federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates.  Any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and revenues from our products.Specialty pharmaceuticals are drugs that are prescribed by specialist physicians to treat rare or life-threatening conditions and typically address smaller patient populations.  Each of our products is a specialty pharmaceutical product, and our research and development programs are focused on developing additional specialty pharmaceutical products.  The increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector.  While the effect on us of payers' efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date, the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of governments may lead to significant adverse business affects in the future. 33Table of ContentsAny legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.If we market any of our products in a manner that violates federal or state health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.We are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal False Claims Act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar state and federal laws and regulations.  While we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws our business could be materially harmed.The federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.  The federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.  Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, known as “off-label” uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated “best price” information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.Although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses.  We market INCIVEK for adults with genotype 1 HCV infection and KALYDECO for patients six years of age and older with CF who have the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of INCIVEK and KALYDECO in these patient populations.  If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties.  It also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.  Even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.Also applicable to some of our practices is HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  In addition, certain states have laws governing the privacy of certain health information, which may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, complicating compliance efforts.  Sanctions under 34Table of Contentsthese federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs and criminal fines.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business.In recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities.  Additionally, as part of the ACA, the federal government recently enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions will require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals.  In February 2013, regulations were released that contain detailed guidance regarding the information that must be collected and reported.  We will be required to collect information regarding such payments starting in August 2013 and to begin reporting such information in March 2014.  Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to enhance our systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations.  Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties.  The ACA also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.The sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue.  We have in place policies to govern how we may retain health care professionals as consultants that reflect the current climate on this issue and are providing training on these policies.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Future health care reform measures could hinder or prevent commercial success of our products and drug candidates.The United States federal government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing health care reform.  Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely affect the pricing of health care products, including our approved products and/or any future drug candidates approved for sale.  The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors for health care products to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices we believe are fair for our products or any drugs we may develop and commercialize.New laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, relating to health care availability, methods of delivery or payment for drugs, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenues, and we may need to revise our research and development or commercialization programs.  The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging for any of several reasons, including policies advanced by the U.S. government, new health care legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities.  Specifically, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products.  Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.  The ACA has far reaching consequences for biopharmaceutical companies like us.  As a result of this legislation, substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for health care in the United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who would otherwise lack health insurance coverage.  If reimbursement for our products is substantially less than we expect in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely affected.35Table of ContentsFurther federal and state proposals and health care reforms in and outside of the United States could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may further limit our commercial opportunity.  Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the ACA, by the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of such current or future legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of our Products and Drug CandidatesWe are investing significant resources in our development program for VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor, based primarily on data from a Phase 2 clinical trial in which patients received VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor over a short duration.  If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor, or experience delays in doing so, our business would be materially harmed. In February 2013, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical development program for VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor.  We initiated this program based primarily on data from a Phase 2 clinical trial in which a relatively small number of patients received VX-809 as a monotherapy for 28 days, followed by VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor for 28 days.  The pattern of lung function response observed in both Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 of this clinical trial was similar, with a decline in FEV1 during the VX-809 monotherapy dosing period followed by a statistically significant increase in FEV1 during the VX-809 and ivacaftor combination dosing period.  We expect to enroll approximately 500 patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in each of our two Phase 3 clinical trials, for a total of approximately 1,000 patients.  VX-809 will be evaluated in combination with ivacaftor over a significantly longer dosing period of 24 weeks and without the monotherapy lead-in period.  In order to obtain approval for VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor, we will need to show that VX-809 in combination with ivacaftor is safe and effective in a significantly larger number of patients than were involved in the Phase 2 clinical trial, over the significantly longer 24-week combination dosing period.  If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of VX-809 and ivacaftor in the relevant patient populations, or experience delays in doing so, our business would be materially harmed. Our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval.  If we are unable to successfully develop additional drug candidates, our business will be materially harmed.Our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of additional drug candidates.  These drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for sale.  To satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates.  Discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate.  Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:•offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs;•be proven safe and effective in clinical trials;•meet applicable regulatory standards;•be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or•if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.We have ongoing or planned clinical trials for a number of our drug candidates and ivacaftor, which is being evaluated in additional patient groups.  The strength of our company’s product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials.  Findings, including toxicology findings, in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials as well as results of our clinical trials could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program.  Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials.  Accordingly, the results from 36Table of Contentscompleted preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale.  In addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials.  Interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.Our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to their development, clinical evaluation, manufacturing and commercialization.  Rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the United States and in most other countries prior to the commercial sale of drug candidates.  Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.  It is possible that none of the drug candidates we are developing will be approved for marketing.The time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the FDA and other countries’ regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years.  Our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  We also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.Any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate.  Any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate.  Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug.  Any such limitations could reduce the size of the market for the drug.We also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement.  The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements.  Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the FDA.  In addition, the FDA may not favorably consider data from clinical trials conducted in foreign jurisdictions.  Foreign jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the FDA and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates.If clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the compound could increase and the competitive position of the compound could be adversely affected.We cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials.  Any of the following could delay our development programs:•ongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;•delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;•a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials;•the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;•inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;•unfavorable FDA or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;37Table of Contents•unfavorable scientific results from clinical trials;•serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing;•favorable results in testing of our competitors’ drug candidates, or FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors’ drug candidates; or•action by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold on a trial.Our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.  In addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials.  Delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.We, our collaborators, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons.  Any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business.We may not successfully develop VX-135 or VX-222 and, as a result, we could be subject to significant impairment charges in future periods.In 2011, we licensed HCV nucleotide analogues from Alios and recorded $250.6 million as an intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet.  In 2009, we acquired ViroChem Pharma Inc., or ViroChem, for $100.0 million in cash and 10.7 million shares of our common stock.  We acquired ViroChem to secure rights to two non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors, VX-222 and VX-759.  In the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the fair value of VX-759 was zero dollars, which resulted in a $105.8 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2011.  As of December 31, 2012, our consolidated balance sheet included intangible assets of $412.9 million related to VX-222 and $250.6 million related to the Alios HCV nucleotide program.There are numerous reasons why we may not be able to successfully develop a combination therapy for the treatment of HCV infection that includes VX-222, VX-135 or a combination of both of them, including:•data from clinical trials involving compounds evaluated separately may not predict possible outcomes, such as unforeseen drug interactions from compounds dosed in combination, which could negatively affect the efficacy and safety profile of the combination therapy;•positive results in small clinical trials and nonclinical studies may not be predictive of results in clinical trials involving large numbers of patients; and•favorable results of testing or earlier FDA or foreign regulatory approval of competitors’ products with a better product profile.There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop VX-222 or VX-135, and if we do not successfully develop both of these drug candidates we will incur additional impairment charges in future periods related to VX-222 and/or VX-135.  If we incur a significant impairment charge, the value of our common stock could decrease.If our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates.We have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drugs and drug candidates.  These processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.  If compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, 38Table of Contentswe may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing.  Any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we are a party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers.  If our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Collaborators, Manufacturing and Reliance on Third PartiesWe depend on our collaborators to work with us to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and some of our drug candidates.We have granted development and commercialization rights for telaprevir to Janssen (worldwide other than North America and specific countries in Asia) and to Mitsubishi Tanabe (specific countries in Asia).  We are entitled to royalties from sales of INCIVO (telaprevir) in Janssen’s territories.  The success of the commercialization of INCIVO in Janssen’s territories is dependent, in part, upon Janssen’s sales and marketing efforts, which we do not control and may not be able to effectively influence.  If Janssen does not effectively market INCIVO, our cash flows from royalties on net sales of INCIVO would be materially harmed.  We also in-license VX-135 from Alios and any loss of this license would materially harm our efforts to develop an all-oral, interferon-free treatment regimen for HCV infection.The risks that we face in connection with these existing and any future collaborations include the following:•Our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates.  The ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates.•Any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.•Collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.  For example, Janssen is dedicating significant development resources and planning to seek approval to market TMC435, a potentially competitive HCV protease inhibitor, which could increase the likelihood that Janssen would terminate our collaboration or apply fewer resources to marketing INCIVO.•Our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances, including, as in the case of our agreement with Janssen, termination without cause.  Any such termination by Janssen could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or disrupt the commercial sale of INCIVO in Janssen’s territories.39Table of ContentsWe depend on third-party manufacturers, including sole source suppliers, to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials.  We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control. We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and distribute INCIVEK (telaprevir) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor) for commercial sale and clinical trials, and our drug candidates for clinical trials.  As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source suppliers of certain components of our products and drug candidates, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control.  Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor.  Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, supply us with raw materials, and contract manufacturers in the European Union and the United States convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form.  Establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.  Although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.Supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely.  Any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials.  Furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for sale and our drug candidates for clinical trials.  These modifications may require us to re-evaluate our resources and the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies.We require a supply of INCIVEK for sale in North America.  We believe there are multiple third parties capable of providing most of the materials and services we need in order to manufacture and distribute INCIVEK.  It is also possible that supply of materials that can not be second-sourced can be managed with inventory planning.  We have limited flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand, due to the significant lead times required to manufacture INCIVEK.We require a supply of ivacaftor for commercial sale (as KALYDECO) and for use in our clinical trials.  We obtain ivacaftor to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network.  Our supply chain includes several sole source suppliers.  A disruption in the commercial supply of KALYDECO for patients would have a significant impact on patients, our business and our product revenues.  A disruption in the clinical supply of ivacaftor could delay the completion of clinical trials and impact timelines for filing an sNDA or NDA. In 2013, we plan to obtain an alternative source for the active ingredient of ivacaftor, which is a sole-sourced material that is critical to the supply of ivacaftor, and to obtain second source suppliers in 2014 for other components of the ivacaftor supply chain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish secondary sources for all of our KALYDECO supply needs on a timely basis or at all.In the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us.  This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.In 2012, we recorded an aggregate of $133.2 million in charges for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories, and future adverse changes in the outlook for commercial sales of INCIVEK could result in additional inventory write-downs and related charges.In 2012, we recorded an aggregate of $133.2 million in charges for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories.  These charges were based on our analysis of our INCIVEK inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for INCIVEK.  As part of the analysis, we considered, among other factors, (i) decreases in demand for INCIVEK during 2012 and our expectation that demand would decrease further in the future, (ii) the potential development by us of other drugs and combination treatments for HCV infection, including pursuant to collaboration agreements to evaluate VX-135 in combination with drug candidates controlled by third parties, that make it unlikely that INCIVEK will play a role in future combination therapies, (iii) the placement of a Boxed Warning on the INCIVEK prescribing information in December 2012, (iv) the potential development by our competitors of other drugs and combination treatments for HCV infection, (v) positive results reported in 2012 from clinical trials of drug candidates being developed by us and our competitors and (vi) the 40Table of Contentsinitiation by our competitors of additional Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating drug candidates for the treatment of HCV infection.  We will continue to evaluate our INCIVEK inventories on a quarterly basis, and future adverse changes in the outlook for commercial sales of INCIVEK, including changes due to future developments with respect to demand for INCIVEK or the advancement or approval of other drugs or combination treatments for HCV infection, could result in additional inventory write-downs and related charges in future periods, which could be material.We may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates.As part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities.  We have a number of research programs and early-stage and mid-stage clinical development programs, and we have entered into non-exclusive collaboration agreements to evaluate VX-135 in combination with compounds controlled by Janssen and GlaxoSmithKline.  At any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or expand an existing collaboration.  Potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program.  No assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all.  If we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials or regulatory requirements.We rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage our clinical trial process and on medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials.  Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.  Accordingly, these third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our trial design.  If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them.  Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected trial.  If clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a trial be redone.  Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed.Risks Related to Intellectual PropertyIf our patents do not protect our drugs, or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation and substantial liabilities.We have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending in the United States, as well as counterparts in other countries.  Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and maintain U.S. and foreign patent protection for our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.  In particular, we believe that composition-of-matter claims are the most significant patent claims for companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry, which focuses on small molecules that are new chemical compounds.  While we have patents or patent applications with composition-of-matter claims for each of our products and clinical drug candidates, only a portion of these patents have been granted.  We cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially.Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to maintain, obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.  U.S. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office.  Similarly, 41Table of Contentspublication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries.  Consequently, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use.  If a third party also has filed a U.S. patent application relating to our products or drug candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention and could lose our patent position.  Furthermore, we may not have identified all U.S. and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or drug candidates.Our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents.  Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents.  Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies.  For instance, the issued patents relating to our products or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties.  Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property.The laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.  If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a drug candidate, it is possible that, before a drug candidate can be commercialized, the related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.  To the extent our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such drug candidates, those drug candidates would not be protected by patents, and we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the FDCA.Risks Related To Our OperationsIf we are unable to successfully implement our strategic plan, our business may be materially harmed.Our strategy is to make focused investments to invent and develop innovative drugs, while we continue to market INCIVEK and KALYDECO to eligible patients to generate revenues and maintain a strong financial position. We expect our total revenues to decline in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of expected decreases in INCIVEK revenues.  While we are seeking to increase our revenues from KALYDECO monotherapy, we do not believe that in the near term these potential increased revenues will be sufficient to offset expected declines in INCIVEK revenues.  In order to maintain a strong financial position, we are focusing our development investment on our three key mid- to late-stage development programs in CF, HCV infection and autoimmune diseases.  We also plan to continue our investment in research programs with a focus on identifying drug candidates for specialty markets.  Our INCIVEK net product revenues may decline more quickly than we currently anticipate and we may not be able to increase or sustain our KALYDECO revenues, which would make it difficult to maintain a strong financial position and continue our research and development investments at the levels we currently plan.  In addition, there can be no assurance that our key development programs will be successful or that our research programs will result in drugs that we can successfully develop and commercialize.If we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.We have experienced growth in our headcount and have expanded our global operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure.  To effectively manage our current and future potential growth, we will need to: •implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;•enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;•enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our portfolio management systems;42Table of Contents•train and manage our global employee base;•transition from a U.S.-centric company into an organization capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets; and•enhance our compliance and legal resources.The transition to our new corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts could materially disrupt our business operations.We expect that the transition to our new corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts will be complicated and will require us to expend significant logistical and financial resources in both 2013 and 2014.  Our corporate headquarters and primary research facilities have been located in Cambridge, Massachusetts in close proximity to numerous other biotechnology companies since our founding in 1989.  While we do not expect the move to result in significant turnover, we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain all our key scientific, commercial and management employees. We are endeavoring to complete the interior fit-out of the two new buildings in Boston, Massachusetts by late 2013, and we are planning for a staggered move of employees, office and laboratory supplies and certain equipment from our current facilities to our new corporate headquarters beginning after the completion of the fit-out of the two new buildings.  We will need to complete the fit-out and conduct the move on schedule in order to complete the decommissioning of our existing facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts in a timely manner.  We expect that the move, even if executed on schedule, will cause disruptions to our business operations in Massachusetts, including disruptions to our use of certain laboratories and other research and development facilities.  Our business operations could be materially harmed if the completion of the interior fit-out is significantly delayed, if the move does not proceed as scheduled or if the disruptions to our use of laboratories and other research and development facilities are more significant than expected.Our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims.  If we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, product liability claims could adversely affect our business.Our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of human therapeutic products.  We have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk.  However, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.  If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.Risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.We have expanded our operations in Canada in order to market INCIVEK and KALYDECO and in other international markets in order to market KALYDECO.  A significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in China, Japan and the European Union.  Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries.  Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;•collectibility of accounts receivable;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;43Table of Contents•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.These and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business.In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law.  For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad.  In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  We also are subject to import/export control laws.  Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.If we acquire or license technologies, resources or drug candidates, we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize benefits from the transaction.If appropriate opportunities become available, we might license or acquire technologies, resources, drugs or drug candidates.  We might never realize the anticipated benefits of such a transaction, and we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction.  In particular, due to the risks inherent in drug development, we may not successfully develop or obtain marketing approval for the drug candidates we acquire.  For example, we incurred a $105.8 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2011 in connection with VX-759, which we obtained through our 2009 acquisition of ViroChem.  Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.If we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.The number of our employees increased by approximately 10% during 2012 and approximately 18% during 2011, and we are likely to experience additional growth in 2013.  Because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities.  In addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines.  We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry.  Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in Massachusetts makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to Massachusetts.  Our ability to commercialize our products, and achieve our research and development objectives, depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization to accommodate anticipated growth.  If we are unable to hire qualified personnel or manage our growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.The loss of the services of key employees or the failure to effectively integrate key employees could negatively affect our business and future growth.Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key scientific and management personnel and to integrate new scientific and management personnel into our business.  A loss of key personnel or a failure to properly integrate new personnel could be disruptive.  We have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us.  However, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice.  The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time—such as options and restricted stock—is significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.  A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our organization a sufficient 44Table of Contentsnumber of qualified scientists, professionals, sales personnel and senior management would negatively affect our business and our ability to grow our business.If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.Our research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds.  Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials can not be eliminated.  If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial.  We also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials.  Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.  We maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate.  Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future.  We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.Risks Related to Holding Our Common Stock and Potential Financing ActivitiesOur stock price may fluctuate.Market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile.  From January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012, our common stock traded between $26.50 and $66.10 per share.  The market for our stock, like that of other companies in the pharmaceuticals industry, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.  The future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:•the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues, royalty revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods;•prescription data and other information disclosed by third-parties regarding our business or products;•announcements of FDA actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors’ drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors or of results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors;•technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;•government regulatory action;•public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;•developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;•developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example relating to intellectual property rights;•developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;•business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and•general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions.Our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future.  Factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations in the past include variable amounts of product revenues and 45Table of Contentscollaboration revenues, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete INCIVEK inventories and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments.  We cannot accurately predict our future revenues from our products, and our revenues from our products could vary on a quarterly basis.  Our revenues from our products, and in particular INCIVEK, may be affected by, among other factors, seasonality and the timing of orders from our significant customers.  Our quarterly results also could be significantly affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past.  Most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term.  As a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter.These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these “Risk Factors,” could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results.  Our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.We expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.Any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors’ perceptions regarding our future prospects.  We, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences.  These periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors’ expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates.  The timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences.  In addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results.We could be negatively affected by securities class action complaints.On September 6, 2012, a purported securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under the caption City of Bristol Pension Fund v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al., naming as defendants us and certain of our current and former officers and directors.  The lawsuit alleges that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our public disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through June 28, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  By order dated December 12, 2012, the court appointed the City of Bristol lead plaintiff and appointed the City of Bristol's attorneys lead counsel.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 11, 2013.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants' sales of our common stock.  We believe that this action is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously.  This action will take time and money to defend and may distract us from more productive activities.  No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in defending this claim or that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims.We may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.Although we do not have any plans to do so in the near term, we may in the future need to raise additional capital.  Any potential public offering or private placement may or may not be similar to the transactions that we have completed in the past.  Any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends—although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  Any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders.  If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates.  Based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.46Table of ContentsOutstanding indebtedness may make it more difficult to obtain additional financing or reduce our flexibility to act in our best interests.We are obligated to repay an aggregate of $400.0 million for our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2015, or 2015 Notes, no later than October 1, 2015.  We also are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal amount of the 2015 Notes.  We may issue additional convertible debt or incur other types of indebtedness in the future.  The level of our indebtedness could affect us by:•making it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;•shortening the duration of available revolving credit because lenders may seek to avoid conflicting maturity dates;•constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate or to changes in our business or the pharmaceutical industry; or•potentially requiring the dedication of substantial amounts to service the repayment of outstanding debt, including periodic interest payments, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes.Issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.As of December 31, 2012, we had 217.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  As of December 31, 2012, we also had outstanding options to purchase 19.7 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.09 per share and 8.2 million shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our 2015 Notes, at a conversion price of approximately $48.83 per share.  Outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options and restricted stock to directors and employees.  In addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders.  Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.  In addition, the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.We have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to Massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving Vertex.Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and Massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of Vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders.  Our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the Board of Directors.  Our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote.  We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our Board of Directors may determine.  The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  Massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval.  As a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in particular, the description of our Business set forth in Item 1, the Risk Factors set forth in this .
