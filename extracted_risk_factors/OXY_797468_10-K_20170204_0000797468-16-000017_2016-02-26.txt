ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORSVolatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect Occidental’s results of operations.Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products. Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely. Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets. Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control. These factors include, among others: ØWorldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. ØThe cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.ØOperational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas. ØChanges in weather patterns and climatic changes.ØThe impacts of the members of OPEC and other producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels.ØThe worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.ØThe price and availability of alternative and competing fuels.ØDomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.ØAdditional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments.ØGeneral economic conditions worldwide.The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain. Generally, Occidental's practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products in the future. Recent global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly. These conditions may continue for an extended period. Continued reductions in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, share repurchases and impair the carrying value of assets. The prices obtained for Occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.Occidental's restructuring activities may affect its stock price.Occidental has performed a strategic review of its operations, which has resulted in the restructuring and the separation or divestiture of various assets. This activity and further implementation of the strategic review may affect the market value of Occidental's common stock. For example, Occidental may take different actions than expected, receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures. Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.Occidental bears the risks of equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its             6ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental’s results of operations.Occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces risks of:ØNew or amended laws and regulations, or interpretations of such laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use or increased use of land, water and other natural resources, safety, security and environmental protection, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental's costs or reduce demand for Occidental's products.ØRefusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.ØDevelopment delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits and authorizations. In addition, Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions. Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves. Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies. Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts. In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.Occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less- than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.Occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies.  The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves.  Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates, and the variance may be material.  If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.  In addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with SEC regulations. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Concerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect Occidental’s operations or results.The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require Occidental to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for products that Occidental’s businesses produce. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for products produced by Occidental’s businesses. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental’s business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the certainty and timing of these potential effects are unknown.             7Occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events.The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes, other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates. Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.Cyber attacks could significantly affect Occidental.Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. Occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack. If, however, Occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures were compromised, the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant. Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. Unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline. Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
