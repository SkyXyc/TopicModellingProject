    Business





 



    The
    Company


 


    Apartment Investment and Management Company, or Aimco, is a
    Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. We
    are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment
    trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership,
    management and redevelopment of apartment properties. We
    primarily invest in the 20 largest U.S. markets, as
    measured by total market capitalization, which is the total
    market value of institutional-grade apartment properties in a
    particular market. We define these markets as “target
    markets” and they possess the following characteristics: a
    high concentration of population and apartment units; geographic
    and employment diversification; and historically strong returns
    with reduced volatility as part of a diversified portfolio. We
    are one of the largest owners and operators of apartment
    properties in the United States.


 


    We own an equity interest in, and consolidate the majority of,
    the properties in our owned real estate portfolio. These
    properties represent the consolidated real estate holdings in
    our financial statements, which we refer to as consolidated
    properties. In addition, we have an equity interest in, but do
    not consolidate for financial statement purposes, certain
    properties that are accounted for under the equity or cost
    methods. These properties represent our investment in
    unconsolidated real estate partnerships in our financial
    statements, which we refer to as unconsolidated properties.
    Additionally, we provide property management and asset
    management services to certain properties, and in certain cases,
    we may indirectly own generally less than one percent of the
    operations of such

    properties through a partnership syndication or other fund. Our
    equity holdings and managed properties are as follows as of
    December 31, 2009:

    Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP, Inc. and
    AIMCO-LP Trust, we own a majority of the ownership interests in
    AIMCO Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the Aimco Operating
    Partnership. As of December 31, 2009, we held an interest
    of approximately 93% in the common partnership units and
    equivalents of the Aimco Operating Partnership. We conduct
    substantially all of our business and own substantially all of
    our assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in
    the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited
    partners other than Aimco are referred to as
    “OP Units.” OP Units include common
    OP Units, partnership preferred units, or preferred
    OP Units, and high performance partnership units, or High
    Performance Units. Generally, after a holding period of twelve
    months, holders of common OP Units may redeem such units
    for cash or, at the Aimco Operating Partnership’s option,
    Aimco Class A Common Stock, which we refer to as Common
    Stock. At December 31, 2009, we had 116,479,791 shares
    of our Common Stock outstanding and the Aimco Operating
    Partnership had 8,374,233 common OP Units and equivalents
    outstanding for a combined total of 124,854,024 shares of
    Common Stock and OP Units outstanding (excluding preferred
    OP Units).


 


    Since our initial public offering in July 1994, we have
    completed numerous transactions, including purchases of
    properties and interests in entities that own or manage
    properties, expanding our portfolio of owned or managed
    properties from 132 properties with 29,343 apartment units to a
    peak of over 2,100 properties with 379,000 apartment units. As
    of December 31, 2009, our portfolio of owned
    and/or
    managed properties consists of 870 properties with 135,654
    apartment units.


 


    Except as the context otherwise requires, “we,”
    “our,” “us” and the “Company”
    refer to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and their
    consolidated entities, collectively. As used herein, and except
    where the context otherwise requires, “partnership”
    refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company
    and “partner” refers to a limited partner in a limited
    partnership or a member in a limited liability company.

    Financial
    Information About Industry Segments


 


    We operate in two reportable segments: real estate (owning,
    operating and redeveloping apartments) and investment management
    (portfolio management and asset management, which are further
    discussed in the Business Overview). For further information on
    these segments, see Note 17 of the consolidated financial
    statements in Item 8, and Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis in Item 7.


 



    Business
    Overview


 


    Our principal financial objective is to increase long-term
    stockholder value, both as measured by Net Asset Value, which is
    the estimated fair value of our assets, net of debt, or NAV, and
    total shareholder return.

Table of Contents





    We strive to meet our objectives through:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    property operations — using scale and technology to
    increase the effectiveness and efficiency of attracting and
    retaining apartment residents;




 



     
        • 

    
    portfolio management — allocating capital among
    geographic markets and apartment property types, primarily
    Class B and B+ quality apartments that are well located
    within the 20 largest U.S. markets, through sales,
    redevelopment
    and/or
    acquisitions;




 



     
        • 

    
    managing our cost and risk of capital by using leverage that is
    largely long-term, laddered in maturity, non-recourse and
    property specific; and




 



     
        • 

    
    reducing our general and administrative and certain other costs
    through outsourcing and standardization.





 


    Our business is organized around two core activities: Property
    Operations and Investment Management. These core activities,
    along with our financial strategy, are described in more detail
    below.


 



    Property
    Operations


 


    Our portfolio is comprised of two business components:
    conventional and affordable. Our conventional operations, which
    provide 88% of our property net operating income and are
    market-rate apartments with rents paid by the resident, include
    243 properties with 74,030 units. Our affordable operations
    provide 12% of our property net operating income and consist of
    260 properties with 29,650 units, with rents that are
    generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency.
    Affordable properties tend to have relatively more stable rents
    and higher occupancy due to government rent payments and thus
    are much less affected by market fluctuations.


 


    We operate a broad range of property types, from suburban
    garden-style to urban high-rise properties in 44 states,
    the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico at a range of average
    monthly rental rates. On average, our portfolio rents are
    somewhat above the average rents in the local markets. This
    diversification in geography insulates us, to some degree, from
    inevitable downturns in any one market.


 


    Our property operations currently are organized into five areas,
    which are further subdivided according to our target markets. To
    manage our nationwide portfolio more efficiently and to increase
    the benefits from our local management expertise, we have given
    direct responsibility for operations within each area to an area
    operations leader with regular senior management reviews. To
    enable the area operations leaders to focus on sales and
    service, as well as to improve financial control and budgeting,
    we have dedicated an area financial officer to support each area
    operations leader, and with the exception of routine
    maintenance, our specialized Construction Services group manages
    all on-site
    improvements, thus reducing the need for the area operations
    leaders to spend time on oversight of construction projects.


 


    We seek to improve our oversight of property operations by:
    developing better systems; standardizing business goals,
    operational measurements and internal reporting; and enhancing
    financial controls over field operations. Our objectives are to
    focus on the areas discussed below:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Customer Service.  Our operating culture is
    focused on our residents. Our goal is to provide our residents
    with consistent service in clean, safe and attractive
    communities. We evaluate our performance through a customer
    satisfaction tracking system. In addition, we emphasize the
    quality of our
    on-site
    employees through recruiting, training and retention programs,
    which we believe contributes to improved customer service and
    leads to increased occupancy rates and enhanced operational
    performance.




 



     
        • 

    
    Resident Selection and Retention.  In apartment
    properties, neighbors are a meaningful part of the product,
    together with the location of the property and the physical
    quality of the apartment units. Part of our property operations
    strategy is to focus on resident acquisition and
    retention — attracting and retaining credit-worthy
    residents who are good neighbors. We have structured goals and
    coaching for all of our sales personnel, a tracking system for
    inquiries and a standardized renewal communication program. We
    have standardized residential financial stability requirements
    and have policies and monitoring practices to maintain our
    resident quality.

        • 

    
    Revenue Management.  For our conventional
    properties, we have a centralized revenue management system that
    leverages people, processes and technology to work in
    partnership with our area operational management teams to
    develop rental rate pricing. We seek to increase revenue by
    optimizing the balance between rental and occupancy rates. We
    are also focused on the automation of
    on-site
    operations, as we believe that timely and accurate collection of
    property performance and resident profile data will enable us to
    maximize revenue through better property management and leasing
    decisions. We have standardized policies for new and renewal
    pricing with timely data and analyses by floor-plan, thereby
    enabling us to maximize our ability to modify pricing, even in
    challenging
    sub-markets.




 



     
        • 

    
    Controlling Expenses.  Cost controls are
    accomplished by local focus at the area level and by taking
    advantage of economies of scale at the corporate level. As a
    result of the size of our portfolio and our area concentrations
    of properties, we have the ability to spread over a large
    property base the fixed costs for general and administrative
    expenditures and certain operating functions, such as
    purchasing, insurance and information technology.




 



     
        • 

    
    Ancillary Services.  We believe that our
    ownership and management of properties provide us with unique
    access to a customer base that allows us to provide additional
    services and thereby increase occupancy and rents, while also
    generating incremental revenue. We currently provide cable
    television, telephone services, appliance rental, and carport,
    garage and storage space rental at certain properties.




 



     
        • 

    
    Maintaining and Improving Property Quality.  We
    believe that the physical condition and amenities of our
    apartment properties are important factors in our ability to
    maintain and increase rental rates. In 2009, we spent
    $70.3 million (Aimco’s share), or $723 per owned
    apartment unit, for Capital Replacements, which represent the
    share of additions that are deemed to replace the consumed
    portion of acquired capital assets. Additionally, we spent
    $53.4 million (Aimco’s share), or $549 per owned
    apartment unit, for Capital Improvements, which are
    non-redevelopment capital additions that are made to enhance the
    value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its
    original purchase condition.





 



    Investment
    Management


 


    Investment management includes activities related to our owned
    portfolio of properties as well as services provided to
    affiliated partnerships. Investment management includes
    portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax
    credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other
    transaction activities. Within our owned portfolio, we refer to
    these activities as Portfolio Management, and their benefit is
    seen in property operating results and investment gains. For
    affiliated partnerships, we refer to these activities as asset
    management for which we are separately compensated through fees
    paid by third party investors.


 



    Portfolio
    Management


 


    Portfolio Management involves the ongoing allocation of
    investment capital to meet our geographic and product type
    goals. We target geographic balance in Aimco’s diversified
    portfolio in order to optimize risk-adjusted returns and to
    avoid the risk of undue concentration in any particular market.
    We also seek to balance the portfolio by product type, with both
    high quality properties in excellent locations and also high
    land value properties that support redevelopment activities. We
    intend to slightly reduce our allocation of capital to
    affordable properties to 10% of our NAV.


 


    Our geographic allocation strategy focuses on our target markets
    to reduce volatility in and our dependence on particular areas
    of the country. We believe our target markets are deep,
    relatively liquid and possess desirable long-term growth
    characteristics. They are primarily coastal markets, and also
    include a number of Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. We
    may also invest in other markets on an opportunistic basis. We
    intend to upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the sale
    of approximately 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually, with the
    proceeds generally used to increase our allocation of capital to
    well located properties within our target markets through
    capital investments, redevelopment or acquisitions. We expect
    that increased geographic focus will also add to our investment
    knowledge and increase operating efficiencies based on local
    economies of scale.

Table of Contents





    Our portfolio management activities include strategic portfolio
    and capital allocation decisions including transactions to buy,
    sell or modify our ownership interest in properties, including
    through the use of partnerships and joint ventures, and to
    increase our investment in existing properties through
    redevelopment. The purpose of these transactions is to adjust
    Aimco’s investments to reflect our decisions regarding
    target allocations to geographic markets and to investment types.


 


    We believe redevelopment of certain properties in superior
    locations provides advantages over
    ground-up
    development, enabling us to generate rents comparable to new
    properties with lower financial risk, in less time and with
    reduced delays associated with governmental permits and
    authorizations. Redevelopment work also includes seeking
    entitlements from local governments, which enhance the value of
    our existing portfolio by increasing density, that is, the right
    to add residential units to a site. We have historically
    undertaken a range of redevelopment projects: from those in
    which a substantial number of all available units are vacated
    for significant renovations to the property, to those in which
    there is significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas
    or unit improvements, typically done upon lease expirations
    without the need to vacate units on any wholesale or substantial
    basis. We have a specialized Redevelopment and Construction
    Services group to oversee these projects.


 


    During 2009, we increased our allocation of capital to our
    target markets by disposing of 68 conventional properties
    located primarily outside of our target markets or in less
    desirable locations within our target markets and by investing
    $66.8 million in redevelopment of conventional properties.
    As of December 31, 2009, our conventional portfolio
    included 243 properties with 74,030 units in 38 markets. As
    of December 31, 2009, conventional properties in our target
    markets comprised 88% of our NAV attributable to our
    conventional properties. Our top five markets by net operating
    income contribution include the metropolitan areas of
    Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles, California;
    “Other” Florida (which is comprised of
    Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Palm Beach County
    and Tampa); Chicago, Illinois and Boston, Massachusetts.


 


    During 2009, we invested $46.0 million in redevelopment of
    affordable properties, funded primarily by proceeds from the
    sale of tax credits to institutional partners. As with
    conventional properties, we also seek to dispose of properties
    that are inconsistent with our long-term investment and
    operating strategies. During 2009, we sold 22 properties from
    our affordable portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, our
    affordable portfolio included 260 properties with
    29,650 units.


 



    Financial
    Strategy


 


    We are focused on maintaining a safe balance sheet, including
    minimizing or eliminating our recourse debt and near term
    property debt maturities as well as minimizing our cost of
    capital on a risk adjusted basis. We primarily use non-recourse
    and amortizing property debt with laddered maturities and
    minimize reliance on corporate debt. The lower risk inherent in
    non-recourse property debt permits us to operate with higher
    debt leverage and a lower weighted average cost of capital. We
    use floating rate property and corporate debt to provide lower
    interest costs over time at a level that considers acceptable
    earnings volatility.


 


    During 2009, using proceeds from asset dispositions, we repaid
    $310.0 million of our term loan, which matures in March
    2011, leaving a remaining outstanding balance of
    $90.0 million at December 31, 2009. We repaid an
    additional $45.0 million through February 26, 2010,
    leaving a remaining outstanding balance of $45.0 million.


 


    During 2009, we also focused on reducing refunding risk by
    accelerating refinancing of property loans maturing prior to
    2012. At the beginning of 2009, property debt totaling
    $753.0 million was scheduled to mature prior to 2012.
    During 2009, through refinancing, repayment and property sales,
    we reduced these maturities by 69%, or $516.3 million, and
    eliminated all 2010 property debt maturities. As of
    December 31, 2009, five loans totaling $236.7 million
    were scheduled to mature in 2011. During January 2010, we
    extended the maturity of one of these loans for
    $65.0 million to 2013. We expect to refinance the remaining
    four loans, totaling $171.7 million ($101.2 million
    Aimco’s share), at their maturity.


 


    As of December 31, 2009, we had a $180.0 million
    revolving credit facility and borrowings available of
    $136.2 million (after giving effect to $43.8 million
    outstanding for undrawn letters of credit). The revolving credit
    facility matures in May 2011 and has a one year extension
    option, subject to certain terms.

    Competition


 


    In attracting and retaining residents to occupy our properties
    we compete with numerous other housing alternatives. Our
    properties compete directly with other rental apartments as well
    as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for
    rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are
    located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price
    charged, attractiveness of the location and property and quality
    and breadth of services. The number of competitive properties
    relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on
    our ability to lease apartment units at our properties and on
    the rents we charge. In certain markets there exists oversupply
    of single family homes and condominiums and a reduction of
    households, both of which affect the pricing and occupancy of
    our rental apartments. Additionally, we compete with other real
    estate investors, including other apartment REITs, pension and
    investment funds, partnerships and investment companies in
    acquiring, redeveloping and managing apartment properties. This
    competition affects our ability to acquire properties we want to
    add to our portfolio and the price that we pay in such
    acquisitions.


 



    Taxation


 


    We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code,
    commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994,
    and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. Our current
    and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to
    meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, which relate
    to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of
    stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned
    assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a
    REIT, we will generally not be subject to United States Federal
    corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently
    distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially
    eliminates the “double taxation” (at the corporate and
    stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in
    a corporation.


 


    Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to United States
    Federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as
    on our undistributed income. We also will be required to pay a
    100% tax on any net income on non-arm’s length transactions
    between us and a TRS (described below) and on any net income
    from sales of property that was property held for sale to
    customers in the ordinary course. We and our stockholders may be
    subject to state or local taxation in various state or local
    jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or
    our stockholders reside. In addition, we could also be subject
    to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, on our items of tax
    preference. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the
    United States Federal income tax treatment. Any taxes imposed on
    us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.


 


    Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including
    property management, asset management and risk are conducted
    through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as
    a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status
    and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate
    income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to
    offer certain services and activities to our residents and
    investment partners, as these services and activities generally
    cannot be offered directly by the REIT.


 



    Regulation


 



    General


 


    Apartment properties and their owners are subject to various
    laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to
    real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to
    recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers
    and other common areas. Changes in laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions,
    as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction
    and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated
    expenditures, which would adversely affect our net income and
    cash flows from operating activities. In addition, future
    enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws, such as
    legislation that has been considered in New York, or other laws
    regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenue or
    increase operating costs in particular markets.

    Environmental


 


    Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or
    operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal
    or remediation, of certain hazardous substances present on a
    property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to
    whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,
    the release or presence of the hazardous substances. In
    connection with the ownership, operation and management of
    properties, we could potentially be liable for environmental
    liabilities or costs associated with our properties or
    properties we acquire or manage in the future. These and other
    risks related to environmental matters are described in more
    detail in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”


 



    Insurance


 


    Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general
    liability, and workers’ compensation. We believe that our
    insurance coverages adequately insure our properties against the
    risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane,
    tornado, flood, terrorism and other perils, and adequately
    insure us against other risk. Our coverage includes deductibles,
    retentions and limits that are customary in the industry. We
    have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claims
    handling, litigation management and loss reserving procedures to
    manage our exposure.


 



    Employees


 


    At December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    3,500 employees, of which approximately 2,800 were at the
    property level, performing various
    on-site
    functions, with the balance managing corporate and area
    operations, including investment and debt transactions, legal,
    financial reporting, accounting, information systems, human
    resources and other support functions. As of December 31,
    2009, unions represented 115 of our employees. We have never
    experienced a work stoppage and believe we maintain satisfactory
    relations with our employees.


 





    
    



    
    Item 1A.  

    
    Risk
    Factors





 


    The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted
    throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.


 



    Our
    existing and future debt financing could render us unable to
    operate, result in foreclosure on our properties, prevent us
    from making distributions on our equity or otherwise adversely
    affect our liquidity.


 


    We are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations
    will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, and the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
    refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as
    favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If we fail to
    make required payments of principal and interest on secured
    debt, our lenders could foreclose on the properties and other
    collateral securing such debt, which would result in loss of
    income and asset value to us. As of December 31, 2009,
    substantially all of the properties that we owned or controlled
    were encumbered by debt. Our organizational documents do not
    limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have
    significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal
    and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to
    operate our properties or pay distributions required to be paid
    in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.


 


    Our strategy is generally to incur debt to increase the return
    on our equity while maintaining acceptable coverage ratios. For
    the year ended December 31, 2009, as calculated based on
    the provisions in our credit agreement, which is further
    discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Item 8, we had a ratio of earnings before
    interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt
    service of 1.59:1 and a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of
    1.36:1. On February 3, 2010, we and our lenders agreed to
    reduce the covenant ratios of earnings before interest, taxes
    and depreciation and amortization to debt service and earnings
    to fixed charges from 1.50:1 and 1.30:1, respectively, to 1.40:1
    and 1.20:1, respectively. We expect to remain in compliance with
    these covenants.


 


    At December 31, 2009, we had swap positions with two
    financial institutions totaling $353.1 million. The related
    swap agreements provide for collateral calls to maintain
    specified
    loan-to-value
    ratios. In the event the





    
    8

    values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under
    these agreements decline, we may be required to provide
    additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which
    would adversely affect our cash flows.


 



    Disruptions
    in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain
    financing and the cost of available financing and could
    adversely affect our liquidity.


 


    Our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing
    depends on the overall condition of the United States credit
    markets and, to an important extent in 2009, on the level of
    involvement of certain government sponsored entities,
    specifically, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie
    Mac, and Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae,
    in secondary credit markets. During 2009, the United States
    credit markets (outside of multi-family) experienced significant
    liquidity disruptions, which caused the spreads on debt
    financings to widen considerably and made obtaining financing,
    both non-recourse property debt and corporate borrowings, such
    as our term loan or revolving credit facility, more difficult.


 


    Further or prolonged disruptions in the credit markets could
    result in Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae reducing their level of
    involvement in secondary credit markets which would adversely
    affect our ability to obtain non-recourse property debt
    financing. Additionally, further or prolonged disruptions in the
    credit markets may also affect our ability to renew our credit
    facility with similar commitments when it matures in May 2012
    (inclusive of a one year extension option).


 


    If our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may
    be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing
    through other sources of liquidity, which could result in lender
    foreclosure on the properties securing such debt and loss of
    income and asset value, each of which would adversely affect our
    liquidity.


 



    Increases
    in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce
    our profitability.


 


    As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $654.6 million of variable-rate indebtedness outstanding
    and $67.0 million of variable rate preferred stock
    outstanding. Of the total debt subject to variable interest
    rates, floating rate tax-exempt bond financing was about
    two-thirds, or $433.9 million. Floating rate tax-exempt
    bond financing is benchmarked against the Securities Industry
    and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or
    SIFMA, rate, which since 1989 has averaged 73% of the
    30-day LIBOR
    rate. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $440.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted
    cash and notes receivable, the majority of which bear interest.
    The effect of our interest-bearing assets would partially reduce
    the effect of an increase in variable interest rates. If this
    historical relationship continues, we estimate that an increase
    in 30-day
    LIBOR of 100 basis points (73 basis points for
    tax-exempt interest rates) with constant credit risk spreads
    would result in net income being reduced by $1.1 million
    and income attributable to Aimco common stockholders being
    reduced by $1.5 million on an annual basis.


 



    Failure
    to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect
    our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital
    expenditures or adversely affect our ability to pay
    dividends.


 


    Our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our
    properties depends on, among other things, our ability to
    generate net operating income in excess of required debt
    payments. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our
    properties, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness
    of our properties, which could adversely affect our net
    operating income.


 


    Our ability to make payments to our investors depends on our
    ability to generate net operating income in excess of required
    debt payments and capital expenditure requirements. Our net
    operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by
    events or conditions beyond our control, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the general economic climate;




 



     
        • 

    
    an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and
    maintain our properties increase at a rate greater than our
    ability to increase rents only upon renewal of existing leases
    or at the inception of new leases;




 



     
        • 

    
    competition from other apartment communities and other housing
    options;







    
    9



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    local conditions, such as loss of jobs, unemployment rates or an
    increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely
    affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of
    compliance;




 



     
        • 

    
    increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due
    to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by
    increased rents;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of
    rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily
    housing; and




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in interest rates and the availability of financing.





 



    Covenant
    restrictions may limit our ability to make payments to our
    investors.


 


    Some of our debt and other securities contain covenants that
    restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to
    our investors unless certain financial tests or other criteria
    are satisfied. Our credit facility provides, among other things,
    that we may make distributions to our investors during any four
    consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount that does not
    exceed the greater of 95% of our Funds From Operations for such
    period, subject to certain non-cash adjustments, or such amount
    as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. Our outstanding
    classes of preferred stock prohibit the payment of dividends on
    our Common Stock if we fail to pay the dividends to which the
    holders of the preferred stock are entitled.


 



    Because
    real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be
    able to sell properties when appropriate.


 


    Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and cannot
    always be sold quickly. Our freedom to sell properties is also
    restricted by REIT tax rules. Thus, we may not be able to change
    our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or
    other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of assets in the
    future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions,
    including the cost and availability of financing. This could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations.


 



    Competition
    could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or
    maintain rents.


 


    Our apartment properties compete for residents with other
    housing alternatives, including other rental apartments,
    condominiums and single-family homes that are available for
    rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family
    homes for sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular
    area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and
    to increase or maintain rental rates. The current challenges in
    the credit and housing markets have increased housing inventory
    that competes with our apartment properties.


 



    Our
    subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and
    other payments to us.


 


    All of our properties are owned, and all of our operations are
    conducted, by the Aimco Operating Partnership and our other
    subsidiaries. As a result, we depend on distributions and other
    payments from our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial
    obligations and make payments to our investors. The ability of
    our subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments
    depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to
    statutory or contractual limitations. As an equity investor in
    our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their
    liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated
    to the claims of their creditors. To the extent that we are
    recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may
    still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien
    on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations
    that are senior to our claims.


 



    Redevelopment
    and construction risks could affect our
    profitability.


 


    We intend to continue to redevelop certain of our properties.
    These activities are subject to the following risks:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or
    third party permits and authorizations, which could result in
    increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;







    
    10



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to
    increased material, labor or other costs, such as litigation;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a
    property on schedule, resulting in increased construction and
    financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;




 



     
        • 

    
    occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our
    expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in
    market and economic conditions beyond our control and the
    development by competitors of competing communities;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at
    all, for the proposed development of a property, which may cause
    us to delay or abandon an opportunity;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to
    explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local
    market conditions or increases in construction or financing
    costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in exploring those opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may incur liabilities to third parties during the
    redevelopment process, for example, in connection with resident
    lease terminations, or managing existing improvements on the
    site prior to resident lease terminations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    loss of a key member of a project team could adversely affect
    our ability to deliver redevelopment projects on time and within
    our budget.





 



    We are
    insured for certain risks, and the cost of insurance, increased
    claims activity or losses resulting from casualty events may
    affect our operating results and financial
    condition.


 


    We are insured for a portion of our consolidated
    properties’ exposure to casualty losses resulting from
    fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other perils,
    which insurance is subject to  deductibles and self-insurance
    retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the
    net book value of the affected property and the amount of and
    any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual
    cost to repair or replace the property may exceed its net book
    value and any insurance proceeds. We also insure certain
    unconsolidated properties for a portion of their exposure to
    such losses. With respect to our consolidated properties, we
    recognize the uninsured portion of losses as part of casualty
    losses in the periods in which they are incurred.  In addition,
    we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party
    claims related to our employee health insurance plans,
    workers’ compensation coverage and general liability
    exposure. With respect to our insurance obligations to
    unconsolidated properties and our exposure to claims of third
    parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known
    and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact
    of unforeseen events may vary materially from recorded reserves,
    and variances may adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition. We purchase insurance (or reinsurance where
    we insure unconsolidated properties) to reduce our exposure to
    losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks.
    The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market
    conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we
    will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels
    and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to
    obtain or maintain insurance in amounts we consider appropriate
    for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance
    increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of
    the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks.


 



    Natural
    disasters and severe weather may affect our operating results
    and financial condition.


 


    Natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes may
    result in significant damage to our properties. The extent of
    our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection
    with such events is a function of the severity of the event and
    the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have
    geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe
    (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a
    hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant negative
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We
    cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather,
    or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a
    result, our operating and financial results may vary
    significantly from one period to the next. Although we
    anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that
    our financial results will not be adversely affected by our
    exposure





    
    11



Table of Contents





    to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather in
    the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions.


 



    We
    depend on our senior management.


 


    Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management,
    including Terry Considine, our chief executive officer. We have
    a succession planning and talent development process that is
    designed to identify potential replacements and develop our team
    members to provide depth in the organization and a bench of
    talent on which to draw. However, there are no assurances that
    we would be able to find qualified replacements for the
    individuals who make up our senior management if their services
    were no longer available. The loss of services of one or more
    members of our senior management team could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We do not currently maintain key-man life
    insurance for any of our employees.


 



    If we
    are not successful in our acquisition of properties, our results
    of operations could be adversely affected.


 


    The selective acquisition of properties is a component of our
    strategy. However, we may not be able to complete transactions
    successfully in the future. Although we seek to acquire
    properties when such acquisitions increase our net income, Funds
    From Operations or net asset value, such transactions may fail
    to perform in accordance with our expectations. In particular,
    following acquisition, the value and operational performance of
    a property may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood
    changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the
    property.


 



    We may
    be subject to litigation associated with partnership
    transactions that could increase our expenses and prevent
    completion of beneficial transactions.


 


    We have engaged in, and intend to continue to engage in, the
    selective acquisition of interests in partnerships controlled by
    us that own apartment properties. In some cases, we have
    acquired the general partner of a partnership and then made an
    offer to acquire the limited partners’ interests in the
    partnership. In these transactions, we may be subject to
    litigation based on claims that we, as the general partner, have
    breached our fiduciary duty to our limited partners or that the
    transaction violates the relevant partnership agreement or state
    law. Although we intend to comply with our fiduciary obligations
    and the relevant partnership agreements, we may incur additional
    costs in connection with the defense or settlement of this type
    of litigation. In some cases, this type of litigation may
    adversely affect our desire to proceed with, or our ability to
    complete, a particular transaction. Any litigation of this type
    could also have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.


 



    Government
    housing regulations may limit the opportunities at some of our
    properties and failure to comply with resident qualification
    requirements may result in financial penalties and/or loss of
    benefits, such as rental revenues paid by government
    agencies.


 


    We own consolidated and unconsolidated equity interests in
    certain properties and manage other properties that benefit from
    governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with
    low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually
    administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
    Development, or HUD, or state housing finance agencies,
    typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms,
    tax-credit equity, or rental assistance payments to the property
    owners. As a condition of the receipt of assistance under these
    programs, the properties must comply with various requirements,
    which typically limit rents to pre-approved amounts and impose
    restrictions on resident incomes. Failure to comply with these
    requirements and restrictions may result in financial penalties
    or loss of benefits. We usually need to obtain the approval of
    HUD in order to acquire or dispose of a significant interest in
    or manage a HUD-assisted property. We may not always receive
    such approval.


 


    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, for continuing operations, our
    rental revenues include $140.3 million, $132.3 million
    and $121.4 million, respectively, of subsidies from
    government agencies. Any loss of such benefits would adversely
    affect our liquidity and results of operations.

    Laws
    benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of
    unanticipated expenses.


 


    Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all
    places intended to be used by the public are required to meet
    certain Federal requirements related to access and use by
    disabled persons. Likewise, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of
    1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied
    after March 13, 1990, to be accessible to the handicapped.
    These and other Federal, state and local laws may require
    modifications to our properties, or affect renovations of the
    properties. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the
    imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants
    and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying
    feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures.
    Although we believe that our properties are substantially in
    compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated
    expenses to comply with the ADA and the FHAA in connection with
    the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our properties.


 



    Potential
    liability or other expenditures associated with potential
    environmental contamination may be costly.


 


    Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or
    operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal
    or remediation, of certain hazardous substances present on a
    property, including lead-based paint. Such laws often impose
    liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew
    of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the
    hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure to manage
    or remedy properly, hazardous substances may adversely affect
    occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to
    sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs
    associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by
    government agencies, and potential fines or penalties imposed by
    such agencies in connection therewith, the presence of hazardous
    substances on a property could result in claims by private
    plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other
    infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of
    removal, remediation or disposal of hazardous substances through
    a licensed disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges
    for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances is
    potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose
    liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal
    ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with
    the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could
    potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs
    associated with our properties or properties we acquire or
    manage in the future.


 



    Moisture
    infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be
    costly.


 


    We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits that have alleged
    personal injury and property damage as a result of the presence
    of mold. In addition, we are aware of lawsuits against owners
    and managers of multifamily properties asserting claims of
    personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of
    mold, some of which have resulted in substantial monetary
    judgments or settlements. We have only limited insurance
    coverage for property damage loss claims arising from the
    presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold
    exposure. We have implemented policies, procedures, third-party
    audits and training, and include a detailed moisture intrusion
    and mold assessment during acquisition due diligence. We believe
    these measures will prevent or eliminate mold exposure from our
    properties and will minimize the effects that mold may have on
    our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs
    or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate
    mold conditions. Because the law regarding mold is unsettled and
    subject to change, we can make no assurance that liabilities
    resulting from the presence of or exposure to mold will not have
    a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    condition or results of operations.


 



    We may
    fail to qualify as a REIT.


 


    If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a
    deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing
    our taxable income, and we will be subject to Federal income tax
    at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative
    minimum tax. This would substantially reduce our funds available
    for payment to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under
    certain provisions of the Code, we also would be disqualified
    from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
    year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition,
    our failure to qualify as a REIT would place us in default under
    our primary credit facilities.




    
    13



Table of Contents





    We believe that we operate, and have always operated, in a
    manner that enables us to meet the requirements for
    qualification as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. Our
    continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our
    satisfaction of certain asset, income, investment,
    organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other
    requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the
    asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values
    of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise
    determination, and for which we will not obtain independent
    appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly
    asset requirements also depends upon our ability to manage
    successfully the composition of our income and assets on an
    ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an
    instrument as debt or equity for Federal income tax purposes may
    be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the
    application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly,
    there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, or
    the IRS, will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or
    other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements.
    Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax or other
    considerations may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, or our
    Board of Directors may determine to revoke our REIT status.


 



    REIT
    distribution requirements limit our available
    cash.


 


    As a REIT, we are subject to annual distribution requirements,
    which generally limit the amount of cash we retain for other
    business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We
    generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT
    taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our
    distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax.
    We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply
    with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in
    timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual
    receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds
    on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution
    requirement of the Code.


 



    We
    have in the past chosen, and may in the future choose, to pay
    dividends in our own stock, in which case you may be required to
    pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you
    receive.


 


    We have in the past distributed, and may in the future
    distribute, taxable dividends that are payable in cash and
    shares of our Common Stock. Stockholders subject to the payment
    of income tax receiving such dividends will be required to
    include the full amount of the dividend as taxable income to the
    extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for
    U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a result, a
    U.S. stockholder may be required to pay income taxes with
    respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends
    received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives
    as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may
    be less than the amount included in income with respect to the
    dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time
    of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to
    non-U.S. stockholders,
    we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to
    such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such
    dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant
    number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our
    Common Stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put
    downward pressure on the trading price of our Common Stock.


 


    No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose
    additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable
    cash/stock dividends, including on a retroactive basis, or
    assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock
    dividends have not been met.


 



    Limits
    on ownership of shares in our charter may result in the loss of
    economic and voting rights by purchasers that violate those
    limits.


 


    Our charter limits ownership of our Common Stock by any single
    stockholder (applying certain “beneficial ownership”
    rules under the Federal securities laws) to 8.7% of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock, or 15% in the case of
    certain pension trusts, registered investment companies and
    Mr. Considine. Our charter also limits ownership of our
    Common Stock and preferred stock by any single stockholder to
    8.7% of the value of the outstanding Common Stock and preferred
    stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered
    investment companies and Mr. Considine. The charter also
    prohibits anyone from buying shares of our capital stock if the
    purchase would result in us losing our REIT status. This could
    happen if a transaction results in fewer than 100 persons
    owning all of our shares of capital stock or results in five or
    fewer persons (applying certain attribution





    
    14

    rules of the Code) owning 50% or more of the value of all of our
    shares of capital stock. If anyone acquires shares in excess of
    the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership
    requirements of the Code for REITs:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the transfer will be considered null and void;




 



     
        • 

    
    we will not reflect the transaction on our books;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may demand repayment of any dividends received by the
    affected person on those shares;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may redeem the shares;




 



     
        • 

    
    the affected person will not have any voting rights for those
    shares; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the shares (and all voting and dividend rights of the shares)
    will be held in trust for the benefit of one or more charitable
    organizations designated by us.





 


    We may purchase the shares of capital stock held in trust at a
    price equal to the lesser of the price paid by the transferee of
    the shares or the then current market price. If the trust
    transfers any of the shares of capital stock, the affected
    person will receive the lesser of the price paid for the shares
    or the then current market price. An individual who acquires
    shares of capital stock that violate the above rules bears the
    risk that the individual:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    may lose control over the power to dispose of such shares;




 



     
        • 

    
    may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the
    market price of the shares increases;




 



     
        • 

    
    may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares
    if the market price decreases; and




 



     
        • 

    
    may be required to repay to us any distributions received from
    us as a result of his or her ownership of the shares.





 



    Our
    charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire
    control of us.


 


    The 8.7% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of
    delaying or precluding acquisition of control of us by a third
    party without the consent of our Board of Directors. Our charter
    authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to
    510,587,500 shares of capital stock. As of
    December 31, 2009, 426,157,736 shares were classified
    as Common Stock, of which 116,479,791 were outstanding, and
    84,429,764 shares were classified as preferred stock, of
    which 24,950,134 were outstanding. Under our charter, our Board
    of Directors has the authority to classify and reclassify any of
    our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital
    stock with such preferences, conversion or other rights, voting
    powers restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications
    or terms or conditions of redemptions as our Board of Directors
    may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of
    capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing
    someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control
    were in our stockholders’ best interests.


 



    The
    Maryland General Corporation Law may limit the ability of a
    third party to acquire control of us.


 


    As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland
    laws that may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire
    us and increasing the difficulty of consummating any such
    offers, even if an acquisition would be in our
    stockholders’ best interests. The Maryland General
    Corporation Law, specifically the Maryland Business Combination
    Act, restricts mergers and other business combination
    transactions between us and any person who acquires, directly or
    indirectly, beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our Board
    of Directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and
    662/3%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. The Maryland
    General Corporation Law, specifically the Maryland Control Share
    Acquisition Act, provides generally that a person who acquires
    shares of our capital stock representing 10% or more of the
    voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights
    unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible
    to vote. Additionally, the Maryland General Corporation Law
    provides, among other things, that the board of directors has
    broad discretion in adopting stockholders’ rights plans and
    has





    
    15

    the sole power to fix the record date, time and place for
    special meetings of the stockholders. To date, we have not
    adopted a shareholders’ rights plan. In addition, the
    Maryland General Corporation Law provides that corporations that:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    have at least three directors who are not officers or employees
    of the entity or related to an acquiring person; and




 



     
        • 

    
    has a class of equity securities registered under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,





 


    may elect in their charter or bylaws or by resolution of the
    board of directors to be subject to all or part of a special
    subtitle that provides that:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the corporation will have a staggered board of directors;




 



     
        • 

    
    any director may be removed only for cause and by the vote of
    two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of
    directors generally, even if a lesser proportion is provided in
    the charter or bylaws;




 



     
        • 

    
    the number of directors may only be set by the board of
    directors, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or
    bylaws;




 



     
        • 

    
    vacancies may only be filled by the remaining directors, even if
    the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the secretary of the corporation may call a special meeting of
    stockholders at the request of stockholders only on the written
    request of the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority
    of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, even if the
    procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws.





 


    To date, we have not made any of the elections described above.
