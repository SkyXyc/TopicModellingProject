Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries.UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKSSouthern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses, including rates and charges, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices, and the operation of fossil-fuel, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and biomass generating facilities, as well as transmission and distribution facilities. For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by Southern Power must be approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates could be affected absent the ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority. Additionally, the respective state PSCs must approve the traditional operating companies' requested rates for retail customers. While the retail rates of the traditional operating companies are designed to provide for the full recovery of costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital), there can be no assurance that a state PSC, in a future rate proceeding, will not attempt to alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is sought or to modify the current authorized rate of return.Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals, and certificates have been obtained for their respective existing operations and that their respective businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address air quality, water, coal combustion byproducts, global climate change, renewable energy standards, and other matters and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could negatively impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power.The Southern Company system is subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to adequately protect the environment. Compliance with these environmental requirements requires the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at substantially all of their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power expect that they will increase in the future. Through 2012, the traditional operating companies had invested approximately $8.7 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with these requirements. The EPA has adopted and is in the process of implementing regulations governing the emission of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the Clean Air Act through the national ambient air quality standards, CAIR, the MATS rule, and other air quality regulations and is in the process of considering additional revisions. In addition, the EPA has proposed additional regulations governing cooling water intake structures and is expected to propose revisions to the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants under I-14Table of Contents                             Index to Financial Statementsthe Clean Water Act. The EPA is also evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion byproducts (including coal ash and gypsum) is merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws.  Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to air quality, water, coal combustion byproducts, global climate change, or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power.In addition, the EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are regulated pollutants under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration preconstruction permit program and the Title V operating permit program, which both apply to power plants and other commercial and industrial facilities. On April 13, 2012, the EPA published proposed regulations to establish standards of performance for greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel steam electric generating units and has indicated that it will propose standards of performance for existing units in the future. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations and regulations relating to global climate change that are promulgated; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the fuel mix of the electric utilities. Compliance costs may arise from existing unit retirements, installation of additional environmental controls, upgrades to the transmission system, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units. Additionally, if Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions against Alabama Power and Georgia Power and issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and Mississippi Power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are also parties to suits alleging that emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global climate change. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates for the traditional operating companies or market-based rates for Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as air quality and water standards, has increased generally throughout the U.S. In particular, personal injury, property damage, and other claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, coal combustion byproducts, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters, have become more frequent.The ultimate cost impact of proposed and final legislation and regulations and litigation are likely to result in significant and additional costs and could result in additional operating restrictions. The net income of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be negatively impacted by changes in regulations related to transmission planning processes and competition in the wholesale electric markets. The traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. A small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through the wholesale electric tariff but the majority of transmission revenues are collected through retail rates. Proposed or potential changes in federal law, regulatory uncertainty, and industry restructuring are expected to continue to present challenges to the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission and competition on the wholesale level. Any changes could have an adverse impact on the ownership of transmission assets and/or future revenues. As an example, pending FERC regulation pertaining to cost allocation for regional transmission projects could require Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries to subsidize costs outside of the Southern Company system's retail service territory. I-15Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsThe FERC rules related to transmission are intended to spur the development of new transmission infrastructure to promote and encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply as well as facilitate competition in the wholesale market by providing more choices to wholesale power customers. In addition to the impacts on transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations also impact power hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges as well as over-the-counter. Finally, technology changes in the power and fuel industries continue to create significant impacts to wholesale transaction cost structures. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power cannot predict the impact of these and other such developments, nor can they predict the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are typically driven by factors beyond their control. The financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be adversely affected by these and other changes. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.Owners and operators of bulk power systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by the North American Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If any traditional operating company or Southern Power is found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, such traditional operating company or Southern Power could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. OPERATIONAL RISKSThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of its subsidiaries' electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, particularly with older generating facilities;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •terrorist attacks; •fuel or material supply interruptions; •compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards;•implementation of technologies with which the Southern Company system is developing experience;•information technology system failure; •cyber intrusion; and •catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as influenzas, or other similar occurrences.A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. In addition, an investment in a subsidiary with such generation, transmission, or distribution facilities could be adversely impacted.I-16Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, natural disasters, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage. Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 MWs, or 8.0%, of Southern Company's generation capacity as of December 31, 2012. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Due solely to the increase in nuclear generating capacity, the below risks are expected to increase once Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are operational. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health, and financial risks such as:•the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel;•uncertainties with respect to the on-site storage of and the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel;•uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning;•limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the nuclear operations of Alabama Power and Georgia Power or those of others in the United States;•potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities;•significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities, including repairs and upgrades required by the NRC;• the threat of a possible terrorist attack; and•the impact of a natural disaster. Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. As a result of the major earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant, the NRC is performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S., which could potentially impact future operations and capital requirements. The NRC also issued three orders and the NRC staff issued guidance on acceptable approaches for compliance with these orders before the December 31, 2016 deadline, that included, among other items, additional mitigation strategies for beyond-design-basis events, enhanced spent fuel pool instrumentation capabilities, hardened vents for certain classes of containment structures, including the one in use at Plant Hatch, site specific evaluations for seismic and flooding hazards, and various plant evaluations to ensure adequate coping capabilities during station blackout and other conditions. The final form and the resulting impact of any changes to safety requirements for nuclear reactors will be dependent on further review and action by the NRC and cannot be determined at this time. In the event of non-compliance with NRC licensing and safety-related requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Southern Company system nuclear plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the United States could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.I-17Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsIn addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict. Physical or cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate and could adversely affect financial results and liquidity.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power face the risk of physical and cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation facilities, the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power, and their information technology systems and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees and other confidential information.  The traditional operating companies and Southern Power face on-going threats to their business networks. Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all technology systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error or physical or cyber attacks. If the traditional operating companies' or Southern Power's technology systems were to fail or be breached and were not recovered in a timely way, the traditional operating companies or Southern Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the applicable traditional operating company or Southern Power to penalties and claims from third parties.These events could negatively affect the financial results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power through lost revenues, costs to recover and repair damage, and costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and biomass, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate their respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company.The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Each traditional operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates.In addition, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to a greater extent are dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. In many instances, the cost of purchased power for the traditional operating companies and Southern Power is influenced by natural gas prices. Historically, natural gas prices have been more volatile than prices of other fuels. In recent years, domestic natural gas prices have been depressed by robust supplies, including production from shale gas, as well as lower demand. These market conditions, together with additional regulation of coal-fired generating units, have increased the traditional operating companies' reliance on natural gas-fired generating units. Natural gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane. The availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility may have a material impact on the supply and cost of natural gas.I-18Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsIn addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the cost and availability of natural gas, coal, and uranium. The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. In addition, the traditional operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs. Even though Southern Power and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit evaluation process and contractual protections, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations and contractual protections take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted. Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured.Changes in technology may make Southern Company's electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power less competitive.A key element of the business models of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production. If  these technologies became cost competitive and achieved economies of scale, the market share of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. It is also possible that rapid advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' results of operations.Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. Such operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, especially with the workforce needs associated with new nuclear and IGCC construction. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses. If Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies, are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.CONSTRUCTION RISKSSouthern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power require ongoing capital expenditures, including those to meet environmental standards.The businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, including those to meet environmental standards. Certain of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, expanding existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects are long-term in nature and in some cases involve facility designs that have not been I-19Table of Contents                             Index to Financial Statementsfinalized or previously constructed. The completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:•shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; •work stoppages; •contractor or supplier delay or non-performance under construction or other agreements or non-performance by other major participants in construction projects;  •delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, and other regulatory authorizations;•impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations; •the outcome of legal challenges to regulatory approvals;•failure to construct in accordance with licensing requirements;•continued public and policymaker support for such projects;•adverse weather conditions; •unforeseen engineering problems;•changes in project design or scope;•environmental and geological conditions; •delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and•unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor, and increased financing costs as a result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of construction schedule delays. In addition, with respect to the construction of new nuclear units and the operation of existing nuclear units, a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. As a result of the major earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant, the NRC is performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S., which could potentially impact future operations and capital requirements. If a traditional operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. Even if a construction project is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates. In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Construction delays also may result in the loss of otherwise available investment tax credits, production tax credits, and other tax incentives. Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income.Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations.I-20Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsThe two largest construction projects currently underway in the Southern Company system are the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the construction of the Kemper IGCC. Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of and will operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (each, an approximately 1,100 MW AP1000 nuclear generating unit). Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the new units. The NRC certified the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC's Design Certification Document, as amended (DCD), for the AP1000 reactor design, effective December 30, 2011, and issued combined COLs on February 10, 2012.  Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. Separate groups of petitioners have filed petitions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking judicial review of the NRC's issuance of the COLs and certification of the DCD.  Additional technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, at the federal and state level, are expected as construction proceeds.Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring (VCM) reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. Georgia Power's eighth VCM report requests approval for an additional $0.2 billion of construction capital costs incurred through December 31, 2012. If the projected certified construction capital costs to be borne by Georgia Power increase by 5% or the projected in-service dates are significantly extended, Georgia Power is required to seek an amendment to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate from the Georgia PSC. Accordingly, the eighth VCM also requests an amendment to the certificate to increase the estimated in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $4.8 billion and to extend the estimated in-service dates to fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2018 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively. Associated financing costs during the construction period are estimated to total approximately $2.0 billion.Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG Power, and the City of Dalton (collectively, the Owners) and Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Stone & Webster, Inc. (Stone & Webster) (collectively, the Contractor) are involved in litigation regarding the costs associated with design changes to the DCD and delays in the timing of approval of the DCD and issuance of the COLs, including the assertion by the Contractor that the Owners are responsible for these costs and that the Contractor is entitled to further schedule extensions. Georgia Power has not agreed with either the proposed cost or schedule adjustments or that the Owners have any responsibility for costs related to these issues. While litigation has commenced and Georgia Power intends to vigorously defend its positions, Georgia Power expects negotiations with the Contractor to continue with respect to costs and schedule during which negotiations the parties may reach a mutually acceptable compromise of their positions.In addition, there are processes in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the DCD and COLs, including rigorous inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. License amendment requests are pending with the NRC to address a few non-safety significant deviations that were identified in the fourth quarter of 2012 with respect to the rebar design for the Plant Vogtle Unit 3 nuclear island. Various design and other issues are expected to arise as construction proceeds, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs either to the Owners, the Contractor, or both. As construction continues, additional delays in the fabrication and assembly of structural modules or the failure of such modules to meet applicable standards, or other issues may further impact project schedule and costs. Additional claims by the Contractor or Georgia Power (on behalf of the Owners) are also likely to arise throughout construction. These claims may be resolved through formal and informal dispute resolution procedures under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, but also may be resolved through litigation. In addition, Mississippi Power is constructing the Kemper IGCC. Mississippi Power and SMEPA are parties to an amended Asset Purchase Agreement whereby SMEPA agreed to purchase a 15% undivided interest in the Kemper IGCC. The closing of this transaction is conditioned upon execution of a joint ownership and operating agreement, receipt of all construction permits, appropriate regulatory approvals, financing, and other conditions. The Mississippi PSC originally approved Mississippi Power's request for a CPCN for the construction of the Kemper IGCC in 2010. Following judicial proceedings relating to its original order, the Mississippi PSC issued a detailed order (2012 MPSC Order) confirming the CPCN for the Kemper IGCC. On April 26, 2012, the Sierra Club appealed the 2012 MPSC Order to the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi (Chancery Court). On December 17, 2012, the Chancery Court affirmed the 2012 MPSC Order which confirmed the issuance of the CPCN for the Kemper IGCC. On January 8, 2013, the Sierra Club filed an appeal of the Chancery Court's ruling with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Additional judicial challenges that may impact the Kemper IGCC are pending, including a challenge of the constitutionality of the Baseload Act that is pending before the Mississippi Supreme Court.The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper IGCC included in the 2012 MPSC Order was $2.4 billion, net of $245.3 million of grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 (CCPI2) and excluding the cost of the I-21Table of Contents                             Index to Financial Statementslignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, and financing costs related to the Kemper IGCC. The 2012 MPSC Order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. Exemptions from the cost cap included in the 2012 Mississippi PSC Order included the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, financing costs, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when Mississippi Power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on the ratepayers, relative to the original proposal for the CPCN). Mississippi Power's current cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC (net of the $245.3 million CCPI2 grant, and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, financing costs, and certain general exceptions as contemplated in the 2012 Mississippi PSC Order and the settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC entered into on January 24, 2013 (Settlement Agreement) that must be specifically approved by the Mississippi PSC) is approximately $2.88 billion. While Mississippi Power continues to believe its cost estimate and schedule projection remain appropriate based on the current status of the project, it is possible that Mississippi Power could experience further cost increases and/or schedule delays with respect to the Kemper IGCC. Certain factors have caused and may continue to cause the costs for the Kemper IGCC to increase and/or schedule delays to occur including, but not limited to, costs and productivity of labor, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay or non-performance under construction or other agreements, and unforeseen engineering problems. To the extent it becomes probable that costs beyond any permitted exceptions to the cost cap will exceed $2.88 billion or it becomes probable that the Mississippi PSC will disallow a portion of the costs relating to the Kemper IGCC, including certain general exceptions as contemplated in the 2012 Mississippi PSC order and the Settlement Agreement, charges to expense may occur and these charges could be material.  The 2012 MPSC Order included provisions relating to both Mississippi Power's recovery of financing costs during the course of construction of the Kemper IGCC and Mississippi Power's recovery of costs following the in-service date of the Kemper IGCC. On June 22, 2012, the Mississippi PSC denied Mississippi Power's proposed Certificated New Plant-A (CNP-A) rate schedule and the 2012 rate recovery filings submitted by Mississippi Power which provided for recovery of financing costs during 2012, pending a final ruling from the Mississippi Supreme Court regarding the Sierra Club's appeal of the Mississippi PSC's issuance of the CPCN for the Kemper IGCC. On July 9, 2012, Mississippi Power appealed the Mississippi PSC's June 22, 2012 decision to the Mississippi Supreme Court and requested interim rates under bond of $55.3 million.  On January 24, 2013, Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC entered into a Settlement Agreement that (1) establishes the process for resolving matters regarding cost recovery related to the Kemper IGCC for the purpose of mitigating risks to Mississippi Power and its customers and expediting the regulatory process associated with future rate filings required under the Settlement Agreement and (2) resolves Mississippi Power's CNP-A rate appeal before the Mississippi Supreme Court. On February 12, 2013, the Mississippi Supreme Court granted Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC's joint filing for dismissal of Mississippi Power's appeal of the Mississippi PSC's June 22, 2012 decision.Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC will follow certain agreed-upon regulatory procedures and schedules for resolving the cost recovery matters related to the Kemper IGCC. These procedures and schedules include the following: (1) Mississippi Power's filing within 30 days of the Settlement Agreement of a new request to increase rates in 2013 in an amount not to exceed a $172 million annual revenue requirement, based upon projected investment as of December 31, 2013, to be recorded to a regulatory liability to be used to mitigate rate impacts when the Kemper IGCC is placed in service (which filing for $172 million was made on January 25, 2013); (2) the Mississippi PSC's decision on that matter within 50 days of Mississippi Power's request; (3) Mississippi Power's collaboration with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to file with the Mississippi PSC within three months of the Settlement Agreement a rate recovery plan for the Kemper IGCC for the first seven years of its operation, along with a proposed revenue requirement under such plan for 2014 through 2020 (which filing was made on February 26, 2013 as described below); (4) the Mississippi PSC's decision on the rate recovery plan within four months of the filing; (5) Mississippi Power's agreement to limit the portion of prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs to be included in rate base to the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, plus costs related to the lignite mine and CO2 pipeline as well as any other costs permitted or determined to be excluded from the cost cap, provided that this limitation will not prevent Mississippi Power from securing alternate financing to recover any prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs, including financing costs and plant costs above the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceeding contemplated by the Settlement Agreement; and (6) the Mississippi PSC's completion of its prudence review of the Kemper IGCC costs incurred through 2012 within six months of the Settlement Agreement, an additional prudence review upon considering the seven-year rate plan for costs incurred through the most recent reporting period, and a final prudence review of the remaining project costs within six months of the Kemper IGCC's in-service date.I-22Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsLegislation to authorize a multi-year rate plan and legislation to provide for alternate financing through securitization was passed in the Mississippi legislature and was signed by the Governor on February 26, 2013. Mississippi Power contemplates using securitization as provided in the  legislation as its form of alternate financing for prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs, including financing costs and plant costs above the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceeding contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. On February 26, 2013, Mississippi Power in compliance with the Settlement Agreement, filed with the Mississippi PSC a rate recovery plan for the Kemper IGCC for 2014 through 2020, the first seven years of operation of the Kemper IGCC. The rate recovery plan proposes recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately $150 million of Kemper IGCC-related operational costs and rate base amounts, including plant costs equal to the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate. Approval of Mississippi Power's request to increase rates in 2013 to mitigate the rate impacts of the Kemper IGCC filed on January 25, 2013 is integral to the rate recovery plan as the proposed filing contemplates amortization of the regulatory liability to be used to mitigate rate impacts from 2014 through 2020, based on a fixed amortization schedule that requires approval by the Mississippi PSC. Under the rate recovery plan filing, Mississippi Power proposes annual recovery to remain the same from 2014 through 2020 and, while it is the intent of Mississippi Power for the actual revenue requirement to equal the proposed revenue requirement for certain items, Mississippi Power proposes that the annual differences for those items through 2020 will be deferred, subject to accrual of carrying costs, and the cumulative balance will be reviewed at the end of the term of the Settlement Agreement by the Mississippi PSC for determination of the manner of the recovery. Mississippi Power proposes to secure recovery of prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs, including financing costs and plant costs above the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceeding contemplated by the Settlement Agreement to be provided for with alternate financing through securitization. The rate recovery necessary to recover the annual costs of securitization is proposed to be filed and begin after the Kemper IGCC is placed in service.  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power has the right to terminate the Settlement Agreement if certain conditions, including the passage of multi-year rate plan legislation that is contemplated under the Settlement Agreement, are not met, if Mississippi Power is unable to secure alternate financing for any prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceeding contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, or if the Mississippi PSC fails to comply with the requirements of the Settlement Agreement. The ultimate outcome of these matters, including the determinations of prudency and the specific manner of recovery of prudently-incurred costs, is subject to further legislative and regulatory actions and cannot be determined at this time.FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKSThe generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or Southern Power's revenues and increase costs.The generation operations and energy marketing operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from the sale of power. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. In addition, the proportion of natural gas generation to the total fuel mix is likely to increase in the future. The Southern Company system attempts to mitigate risks associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through the traditional operating companies' fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:•prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, biomass, and other fuels used in the generation facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;•demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available from current or new competitors;•liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market; •weather conditions impacting demand for electricity; •seasonality; I-23Table of Contents                             Index to Financial Statements•transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;•availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;•forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company system, its competitors, or third party providers;•the financial condition of market participants; •the economy in the service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the impact of economic conditions on demand for electricity and the demand for fuels;•natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism, and other catastrophic events; and•federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases may not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.Historically, the traditional operating companies from time to time have experienced underrecovered fuel cost balances and deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may experience such balances and deficits in the future. While the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through special rate provisions administered by the respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred, and delays in the authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and Southern Company.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment as well as the financial stability of the customers of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in their applicable service territory and are thus impacted by the economic cycles of the customers each serves. Any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of the customers and counterparties of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. As territories served by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power experience economic downturns, energy consumption patterns may change and revenues may be negatively impacted. Customer growth and customer usage can be affected by economic factors in the service territory of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power and elsewhere, including, for example, job and income growth, housing starts, new home prices, and the economic impact on customers of federal fiscal decisions. Adverse economic conditions, a population decline, and/or business closings in the territory served by the traditional operating companies or Southern Power or slower than anticipated customer growth as a result of a recessionary economy or otherwise could also have a negative impact on revenues and could result in greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. As with other parts of the country, the territories served by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power have been impacted by the recent economic recession. The traditional operating companies have experienced residential and commercial sales that continue to be below historical trends due to the recent economic recession. Southern Power is expected to continue to experience reduced future revenues for its requirements customers due to the recent economic recession. The timing and extent of the recovery cannot be predicted. Stronger or more rapid than expected economic growth, coupled with the effects of current and future environmental regulations applicable to the traditional operating companies or Southern Power, could impact the ability of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power to meet the energy demands of their customers. Weaker or slower than expected economic growth could have a negative impact on revenues, could result in greater expense for uncollected customer balances, and could adversely impact the value of generation assets of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power.All of the factors discussed above could adversely affect Southern Company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or Southern Power's level of future net income.The operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, significant weather events, such as I-24Table of Contents                             Index to Financial Statementshurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and droughts could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power and could negatively impact results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity.Electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, available cash, and borrowing ability of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power.In addition, volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional operating companies and the generating facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions which could be subject to major storm activity. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from weather events to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generating facilities and other property. In the event a traditional operating company experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC. While the traditional operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently-incurred costs incurred in connection with such an event, any denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's and Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events within the service territory of any traditional operating company or affecting Southern Power's customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for electricity for extended periods. Any significant loss of customers or reduction in demand for electricity could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's or Southern Power's and Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to Southern Company.Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its own. Substantially all of Southern Company's consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company's subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. Southern Company's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Southern Company with funds.A downgrade in the credit ratings of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power to post collateral or replace certain indebtedness.There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other commitments for capital. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power, borrowing costs would increase, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts.I-25Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsThe use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures. These risk management policies, limits, and procedures might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered for hedging purposes might not off-set the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.Demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to determine the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. This planning process must look many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power may not be able to extend its existing PPAs or to find new buyers for existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or it may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and for Southern Company.Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation facilities.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional operating companies or Southern Power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation facilities. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional operating companies may not be able to recover any of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and for Southern Company.Energy conservation and energy price increases could negatively impact financial results.Customers could voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy price, or individual conservation efforts. In addition, a number of regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Conservation programs could impact the financial results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in different ways. For example, if any traditional operating company is required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact on such traditional operating company and Southern Company. I-26Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsCertain of the traditional operating companies actively promote energy conservation programs, which have been approved by their respective state PSCs. Regulatory mechanisms have been established that provide for the recovery of costs related to such programs and lost revenues as a result of such programs. However, to the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand beyond what is anticipated, the value of generation assets of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power and other unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted and the traditional operating companies could be negatively impacted depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. In addition, the failure of those traditional operating companies who actively promote energy conservation programs to achieve the energy conservation targets established by their respective state PSCs could negatively impact such traditional operating company's ability to recover costs and receive certain benefits related to such programs.Additionally, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could also be negatively impacted if any future energy price increases result in a decrease in customer usage. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation and increases in energy prices will have on their respective financial condition or results of operations.The businesses of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions. The inability of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power is not able to access capital at competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain events or market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:•an economic downturn or uncertainty; •bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated energy company, financial institution, or sovereign entity; •capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally; •changes in tax policy such as dividend tax rates;•market prices for electricity and gas; •terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on Southern Company's facilities or unrelated energy companies' facilities;•war or threat of war; or •the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust assets or may increase plan costs, which then could require significant additional funding.The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Southern Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy obligations to decommission Alabama Power's and Georgia I-27Table of Contents                             Index to Financial StatementsPower's nuclear plants. The Southern Company system has significant obligations related to pension and postretirement benefit plans. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected return rates. A decline in the market value of these assets, as has been experienced in prior periods, may increase the funding requirements relating to benefit plan liabilities of the Southern Company system and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear decommissioning obligations. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under pension and postretirement benefit plans of the Southern Company system; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are also facing rising medical benefit costs, including the current costs for active and retired employees. It is possible that these costs may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than anticipated. If the Southern Company system is unable to successfully manage benefit plan assets and medical benefit costs and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are unable to successfully manage the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected.Southern Company may be unable to recover its investment in its leveraged leases if a lessee fails to profitably operate the leased assets.Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, with terms ranging up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. With respect to Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases, the recovery of its investment is dependent on the profitable operation of the leased assets by the respective lessees. A significant deterioration in the performance of the leased asset could result in the impairment of the related lease receivable.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance.The financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, while Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power maintain an amount of insurance protection that they consider adequate, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies selected by them will cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.Any losses not covered by insurance could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power.
