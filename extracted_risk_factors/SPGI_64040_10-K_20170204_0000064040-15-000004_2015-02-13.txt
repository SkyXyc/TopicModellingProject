BusinessOverviewMcGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading benchmarks & ratings, analytics, data and research provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive and marketing / research information services. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.On November 3, 2014, we completed the sale of McGraw Hill Construction, which has historically been part of our Commodities & Commercial segment, to Symphony Technology Group for $320 million in cash, completing the portfolio rationalization to create McGraw Hill Financial. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $160 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. We intend to use a portion of the after-tax proceeds to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.On March 22, 2013, we completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education ("MHE") to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC for a purchase price of $2.4 billion in cash. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $589 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended  December 31, 2013. We have used a portion of the after-tax proceeds from the sale to pay down short-term debt, for the special dividend paid in 2012, and to continue share repurchases. We intend to continue to use a portion of the after-tax proceeds to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes. In 2014, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divested selected non-core assets, reductions in our real estate portfolio and increased shareholder return.Investments in Targeted Financial Assets / Divested Selected Non-Core AssetsDuring 2014, we continued to execute our strategy of exiting non-core assets while investing for growth in markets that have size and scale.•Commodities & Commercial — we acquired Eclipse Energy Group AS which complements our North American natural gas capabilities, which we obtained from our Bentek Energy LLC acquisition in 2011;•S&P Ratings — we acquired BRC Investor Services S.A., a Colombia-based ratings firm providing risk classifications of banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, corporate bonds and structured issues that will expand our presence in the Latin American credit markets.In 2014, in addition to the divestiture of McGraw Hill Construction discussed above, we streamlined our infrastructure by reducing our real estate footprint by selling our data facility, initiating the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in New York City, as well as disposing of our corporate aircraft.During 2013, we acquired approximately 11 million equity shares representing 15.07% of CRISIL Limited's ("CRISIL") total outstanding equity shares for $214 million, increasing our ownership percentage in CRISIL to 67.84% from 52.77%. In 2013, we also completed certain dispositions of our non-core assets that allow us to apply greater focus on our high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses.•Commodities & Commercial — we completed the sale of Aviation Week to Penton, a privately held business information company; •S&P Capital IQ — we completed the sale of Financial Communications as well as the closure of several non-core businesses.During 2012, we completed several acquisitions and formed a joint venture that we believe position us for long-term growth across all our segments.  6Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             •S&P Dow Jones Indices — our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC; •S&P Capital IQ — Credit Market Analysis Limited, a provider of independent data concerning the over-the-counter markets; QuantHouse, an independent global provider of end-to-end systematic low-latency market data solutions; and R² Technologies, a provider of advanced risk and scenario-based analytics;•Commodities & Commercial — Kingsman SA, a privately-held, Switzerland-based provider of price information and analytics for the global sugar and biofuels markets; •Standard & Poor's Ratings — Coalition Development Ltd., a privately-held U.K. analytics company. Increased Shareholder ReturnDuring the three years ended December 31, 2014, we have returned $3.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and a special dividend.We completed share repurchases of $1.6 billion and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $920 million during the three years ended December 31, 2014. On December 6, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend in the amount of $2.50 per share on our common stock, payable on December 27, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 18, 2012. This returned an additional approximately $700 million to our shareholders. Also, on February 12, 2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.33 per share.Our BusinessesOur operations consist of four reportable segments: Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P Ratings”), S&P Capital IQ, S&P Dow Jones Indices ("S&P DJ Indices") and Commodities & Commercial (“C&C”). S&P RatingsS&P Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics and offers investors and market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default.With offices in over 25 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors; corporations; governments; municipalities; commercial and investment banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.As the capital markets continue to evolve, S&P Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities driven by continuing regulatory changes through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;•bank loan ratings; and•corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.For a discussion on the competitive conditions in our S&P Ratings business, see “MD&A – Segment Review – Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services” contained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.7Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             S&P Capital IQS&P Capital IQ is a global provider of digital and traditional financial research and analytical tools for capital market participants.

Risk FactorsWe are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.We operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers and financial advisors; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within marketing / research information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.•Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of S&P Ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters.•Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.•Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.•Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks 10Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•We may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States and world financial markets. Therefore, since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which S&P Ratings provides credit ratings.•Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.Increasing regulation of our S&P Ratings business in the United States and abroad can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.•In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions ("IOSCO"), the SEC and the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority ("ESMA"), as well as regulators in other countries in which S&P Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.•These laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses, and they may affect S&P Ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which S&P Ratings’ ratings are developed, affect the manner in which S&P Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.11Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             •Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our S&P DJ Indices and C&C businesses are subject to the potential for increasing regulatory review in the United States and abroad, which can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services industry.•On October 5, 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies ("PRA Principles"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, is in the process of completing its alignment to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks. The cost of compliance with the PRA Principles as well as obtaining annual third-party reviews of its adherence to the PRA Principles will increase Platts’ cost of doing business. •In July 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks ("Financial Benchmark Principles"), which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by S&P DJ Indices. S&P DJ Indices has taken steps to align its operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles.•Benchmark regulation is continuing to be considered in the European Union, and at the same time the United Kingdom is also reviewing its domestic framework for the supervision of benchmark administrators; as a result of these measures, as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of Europe, S&P DJ Indices and Platts could, in due course, be required to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their benchmark and price assessment activities in Europe and elsewhere.•The European Union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II ("MiFID II"), which revise and update the existing E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework. MiFID II will apply in full in all E.U. Member States from January 3, 2017. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect S&P DJ Indices’ and Platts’ abilities both to administer and license their indices and price assessments, respectively.Changes to regulations in the United States and abroad may impact our S&P Capital IQ business by increasing the costs of doing business globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•S&P Capital IQ operates regulated businesses in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other countries. These businesses and other S&P Capital IQ businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) likely will impose additional regulatory burdens on McGraw Hill Financial Research Europe Limited ("MHFRE") activities in the European Union, although the exact severity and cost are not yet known.We may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.•Some of our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts.12Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             •Any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.•The markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about the commodities markets are intensely competitive. S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P DJ Indices and C&C compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.•While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.•In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.•Sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts’ revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability.•We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services. These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically. •We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.•We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.•Our major expenses include employee compensation and capital investments. •We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.•We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.•Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.Consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.•Our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in 13Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.•Customers within the financial services and commodities industries that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.•Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.•A material portion of our revenues in our S&P DJ Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.•Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data.•We utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.•If the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.•Certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in our C&C business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.•These concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.•Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.14Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We face legal, economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions.•As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including:•inflation, •fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, •restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars, •differing accounting principles and standards, •potentially adverse tax consequences, •the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the United States, •differing legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards, •changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, •export and import restrictions, tariffs, other trade barriers, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,•competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, •civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.•Adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Additionally, we are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. •Any determination that we have violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. •Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes to our financial processing systems and the transition of certain of our support functions to selected outsource providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•We are in the process of changing certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to implement these changes successfully may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and could lead to business disruption.•In addition, we have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. If the service providers to which we have outsourced these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and, depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, or harm employee morale.15Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.•Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.•Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.•Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.•Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.Our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices. •This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful. •We rely on third-party providers to provide certain essential services. While we believe that such providers are reliable, we have limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of our third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers, we could experience lower revenues and higher costs. •We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer. •We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.•Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party vendors.•The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the global marketplace, or due to our ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of our or our vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ web sites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us or our business or customers.16Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             •Measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become obsolete. Any material incidents could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. •Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.•We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company.•Such transactions present significant challenges and risks.•The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.•If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.•If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations.•The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.17Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Item 1b
