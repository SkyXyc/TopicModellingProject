PART I

 




ITEM 1.
BUSINESS




 

Our Business




Roper Industries, Inc. ("Roper" or the "Company") is a diversified technology company.  We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets; including healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education and academic research.




We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other businesses that offer high value-added services, engineered products and solutions and are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins.   We compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets.

 

We were incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware.




Market Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development




Leadership with Engineered Content for Niche Markets - We maintain a leading position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication of our products and software, the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and systems, and our distribution and service capabilities. Our operating units grow their businesses through new product development and development of new applications and services to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units grow our customer base by expanding our access to customers and entering adjacent markets.




Diversified End Markets and Geographic Reach - We have a global presence, with sales of products to customers outside the U.S. totaling $1.3 billion in 2014.  Information regarding our international operations is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.




Research and Development - We conduct applied research and development to improve the quality and performance of our products and to develop new technologies and products. Our research and development spending was $147.9 million in 2014 as compared to $145.7 million and $125.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.




Our Business Segments




Our operations are reported in four segments based upon common customers, markets, sales channels, technologies and common cost opportunities. The segments are: Medical and Scientific Imaging, RF Technology, Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.




Medical and Scientific Imaging




Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment principally offers products and software in medical applications, and high performance digital imaging products. These products and solutions are provided through ten reporting units. For 2014, this segment had net sales of $1.1 billion, representing 30.4% of our total net sales.




Medical Products and Software - We provide diagnostic and laboratory software solutions to healthcare providers and services and technologies to support the diverse and complex needs of alternate site health care providers who deliver services outside of an acute care hospital setting.  We also manufacture and sell patient positioning devices and related software for use in radiation oncology, 3-D measurement technology in computer-assisted surgery and supply diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures.  We design and manufacture a non-invasive instrument for portable ultrasound bladder volume measurement and a video laryngoscope designed to enable rapid intubation even in the most difficult settings.  




Digital Imaging Products and Software - We manufacture and sell extremely sensitive, high-performance electron filters, charged couple device ("CCD") and complementary metal oxide semiconductor ("CMOS") cameras, detectors and related software for a variety of scientific and industrial uses, which require high resolution and/or high speed digital video, including electron microscopy and spectroscopy applications. We principally sell these products for use within academic, government research, semiconductor, security and other end-user markets such as biological and material science. They are frequently incorporated into products by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").




Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment companies have lead times of up to several months on some of their product sales, although standard products are often shipped within two weeks of receipt of order. Blanket purchase orders are placed by certain OEM and end-users, with continuing requirements for fulfillment over specified periods of time.


4




RF Technology




Our RF Technology segment provides radio frequency identification ("RFID") communication technology and software solutions that are used primarily in toll and traffic systems and processing, security and access control, campus card systems, software-as-a-service in the freight matching and food industries and metering and remote monitoring applications. These products and solutions are provided through six reporting units. This segment had sales of $950.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 26.8% of our total net sales.




Toll and Traffic Systems - We manufacture and sell toll tags and monitoring systems as well as provide transaction and violation processing services for toll and traffic systems to both governmental and private sector entities. In addition, we provide intelligent traffic systems that assist customers in improving traffic flow and infrastructure utilization.




Card Systems/Integrated Security Solutions - We provide card systems and integrated security solutions primarily to education and health care markets. We also provide an integrated nutrition management solution used by food service customers.




Software-as-a-Service - We maintain electronic marketplaces that connect 1) available capacity of trucking units with the available loads of freight to be moved from location to location throughout North America and 2) food suppliers, distributors and vendors, primarily in the perishable food sector.




Metering and Remote Monitoring - We manufacture and sell meter reading, data logging and pressure control products for use in water, gas and electricity applications.  We also provide network monitoring, leakage reduction and pressure control services in water and gas distribution networks.




The RF Technology segment companies' sales reflect a combination of standard products, large engineered projects, and multi-year operations and maintenance contracts. Standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order, and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months. As such, backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards.




Industrial Technology




Our Industrial Technology segment produces fluid handling pumps, materials analysis equipment and consumables, leak testing equipment, flow measurement and metering equipment and water meter and automatic meter reading ("AMR") products and systems. These products and solutions are provided through seven reporting units. For 2014, this segment had net sales of $827.1 million, representing 23.3% of our total net sales.




Fluid Handling Pumps - We manufacture and sell a wide variety of pumps. These pumps vary significantly in complexity and in pumping method employed, which allows for the movement and application of a diverse range of low and high viscosity liquids, high solids content slurries and chemicals. Our pumps are used in end markets such as oil and gas, agricultural, water and wastewater, chemical and general industrial.




Materials Analysis Equipment and Consumables - We manufacture and sell equipment and supply consumables necessary to prepare material samples for testing and analysis. These products are used mostly within the material science, steel, automotive, electronics, mining and research end-user markets.




Flow Measurement Equipment - We manufacture and distribute turbine and positive displacement flow meters, emissions measurement equipment and flow meter calibration products for aerospace, automotive, power generation and other industrial applications.




Water Meter and AMR Products and Systems - We manufacture and distribute water meter products serving the residential, commercial and industrial water management markets, and several lines of automatic meter reading products and systems serving these markets.




The Industrial Technology segment companies' sales reflect a combination of standard products and specially engineered, application-specific products. Standard products are typically shipped within two weeks of receipt of order. Application-specific products typically ship within 6 to 12 weeks following receipt of order. However, larger project orders and blanket purchase orders for certain OEMs may extend shipment for longer periods.




Energy Systems and Controls




Our Energy Systems and Controls segment principally produces control systems, fluid properties testing equipment, industrial valves and controls, vibration sensors and controls and non-destructive inspection and measurement products and solutions, which are provided through six reporting units. For 2014, this segment had net sales of $691.8 million, representing 19.5% of our total net sales.




Control Systems - We manufacture control systems and provide related engineering and commissioning services for turbomachinery applications, primarily in energy markets.



5




Fluid Properties Testing Equipment - We manufacture and sell test equipment to determine physical and elemental properties, such as sulfur and nitrogen content, flash point, viscosity, freeze point and distillation range of liquids and gases primarily for the petroleum industry.




Sensors, Controls and Valves - We manufacture sensors and control equipment including pressure sensors, temperature sensors, measurement instruments and control software for global rubber, plastics and process industries.  We also manufacture and distribute valves, sensors, switches and control products used on engines, compressors, turbines and other powered equipment for the oil and gas, pipeline, power generation, marine engine and general industrial markets. Many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments.




Non-destructive Inspection and Measurement Instrumentation - We manufacture non-destructive inspection and measurement solutions including measurement probes, robotics, vibration sensors, switches and transmitters. These solutions are applied principally in nuclear energy markets. Many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments.




The Energy Systems and Controls segment companies' sales reflect a combination of standard products and large engineered projects. Standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order, and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months. As such, backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards.




Materials and Suppliers




We believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some components and sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors. Supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions.

 

Backlog




Our policy is to include only firm unfilled orders shippable within twelve months in backlog.  Backlog was $1.04 billion at December 31, 2014, and $1.05 billion at December 31, 2013.




Distribution and Sales




Distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices, manufacturers' representatives and distributors.  In addition, our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment also sells through value added resellers ("VARs") and OEMs.




Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation




Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.




Customers




No customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for 2014 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole.




Competition




Generally, our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the size of the niche market we serve. We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.




Patents and Trademarks




In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own or license the rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with, employees, distributors, representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We believe our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.





6




Employees




As of December 31, 2014, we had 10,137 employees, with 7,110 located in the United States. We have 206 employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS







Risks Relating to Our Business




Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.




As of December 31, 2014, we had $2.21 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we had $1.5 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility, as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed $350 million in aggregate. Our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity.  Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions.




Our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:








●
place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;








●
limit our ability to borrow additional funds;








●
limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;








●
limit our ability to pay dividends;








●
limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and








●
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.







Our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.




Our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.

 


  


7




Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business.




Several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar represented 23% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings.




We export a significant portion of our products. Difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business.




Sales to customers outside the U.S. by our businesses located in the U.S. account for a significant portion of our net sales. These sales accounted for 13% and 15% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. Such risks include, without limitation, the following:








●
unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;








●
restrictions on the export of technology and related products;








●
unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries, including Russia;








●
unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and








●
a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.







The occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings.




Economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.




As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, 25% of our net sales and 19% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:








●
adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in Russia and emerging markets;








●
oil price shocks;








●
trade protection measures and import or export requirements;








●
subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations;








●
partial or total expropriation;








●
potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;








●
difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;








●
differing labor regulations;








●
differing protection of intellectual property; and








●
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.







The occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business.




Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.




Our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. We intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.




Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.





8




Product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.




Our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. In addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. We currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. We believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.




Our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.




In some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. The loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. Additionally, many of our customers are government entities. In many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.  In July 2014, Puerto Rico passed the Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act which may impact the future prospects of our customer, the Puerto Rico Highways & Transportation Authority.  At the present time, we believe that existing contracts and payable obligations will be honored.




We face intense competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.




We face intense competition from numerous competitors. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities. We may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive.




Changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.




The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. In addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.




Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change.




We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




Some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy.




Some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. Accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business.





9




Our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization.




Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2014, goodwill totaled $4.71 billion compared to $4.76 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 56% of our total assets of $8.41 billion. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.




We depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business.




The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. This product development may require substantial internal investment. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.




Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology.  Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.




We rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations.




Our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.




Any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.




If terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. A prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
