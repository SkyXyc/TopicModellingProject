  General        

        Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a
result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a
subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "Separation"), USX Corporation
changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation. 

        Before
December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our
energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock ("Steel Stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our
steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation ("United States Steel") to holders of Steel Stock in
exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis. 

        In
connection with the Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and since that date, Marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. 

        On
June 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP") previously held by Ashland Inc. ("Ashland"). In addition,
we acquired a portion of Ashland's Valvoline Instant Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in LOOP LLC which owns and operates the only U.S. deepwater oil port, and its
interest in LOCAP LLC which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions (the "Acquisition"), MAP is now wholly owned by Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company
LLC ("MPC") effective September 1, 2005.

Segment and Geographic Information        

        Our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production ("E&P") – explores for, produces and
markets crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation ("RM&T") – refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products,
primarily in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States; and 3) Integrated Gas ("IG") – markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas,
such as liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. For operating segment and
geographic financial information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

Exploration and Production        

        (In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to "net" wells, production or sales indicate our
ownership interest or share, as the context requires.) 

        We
conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries, with a focus on international growth while continuing to maintain our position in the United States.
Principal exploration activities were in the United States, Norway, Angola and Indonesia. Principal development and production activities were in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway,
Equatorial Guinea and Libya. 

        Our
2006 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations averaged 223 thousand barrels per day ("mbpd"), an increase of 36 percent from 2005 levels. Our
2006 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 847 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 9 percent
compared to 2005. In total, our 2006 worldwide net sales from continuing operations averaged 365 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ("mboe") per day, compared to 319 mboe per day in 2005. (For
purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf") by six. The
liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) In 2007, our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to average 390 to 425 mboe per
day, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. 

        The
above projections of 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production available for sale volumes are forward-looking statements. Some factors that could potentially
affect levels of production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints,
production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals
and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic
considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 

Exploration  

        In the United States during 2006, we drilled 33 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 21 gross (10 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons. Of these 21 wells, 6 gross (4 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of completing at year end. Internationally, we drilled 21 gross (4 net) exploratory wells of
which 16 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 16 wells, 9 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at
December 31, 2006. 

        United States  –  The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area for us. At the end of 2006, we had
interests in 129 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 100 in the deepwater area. 

        During
2006, we increased our interest from 20 percent to 30 percent in the Stones prospect (Walker Ridge Block 508). An appraisal well is planned for 2007 on this
outside-operated 2005 discovery. 

        In
2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona prospect (Garden Banks Block 515) in the Gulf of Mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was
successful. We are continuing to evaluate options to develop the Ozona prospect. Commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of Ozona production and we have been
actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. We hold a 68 percent operated interest in the Ozona prospect. 

        A
well on the Flathead prospect (Walker Ridge Block 30) in the Gulf of Mexico was suspended in 2002. Technical evaluations are complete and commercial evaluations continued in
2006. The drilling of this prospect is delayed due to the shortage of available deepwater rigs. We continue to pursue partnering opportunities with other oil and gas companies that have deepwater rigs
under contract. We hold a 100 percent operated interest in the Flathead prospect. 

        Norway  –  We hold interests in over 700,000 gross acres offshore Norway and plan to continue our
exploration effort there. In 2006, we participated in a successful appraisal well on the Gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast. Marathon holds a 28 percent outside-operated interest in
Gudrun where we are primarily focused on evaluating development scenarios. 

        Angola  –  Offshore Angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 31 and a
30 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32. Through February 2007, we have announced 20 discoveries on these blocks. We have 

3 




 


also
participated in four wells that have reached total depth, the results of which will be announced upon government and partner approvals. We expect to participate in 10 or 11 wells on these blocks
in 2007. 

        On
Block 31, four previously announced discoveries (Plutao, Saturno, Marte and Venus) and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion
of the block. Also on Block 31, we had five previously announced discoveries located in the southeastern portion of the block (Palas, Ceres, Juno, Astraea and Hebe). In 2006 and early 2007, we
announced discoveries at Urano, Titania, Terra and an unnamed well. We are integrating the results of these wells with our previously announced discoveries. 

        On
Block 32, we previously announced three discoveries (Gindungo, Canela and Gengibre). In 2006, we announced the fourth discovery on Block 32, the Mostarda-1, and a
successful deepwater delineation well, Gengibre-2. We also announced that hydrocarbons were encountered in the Salsa well, but additional drilling is required to assess its commerciality.
In early 2007, we announced two additional discoveries, the Manjericao and Caril wells. These discoveries move Block 32 closer toward establishment of a commercial development. 

        Equatorial Guinea  –  During 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the
Alba Block offshore Equatorial Guinea. The Deep Luba discovery well, drilled from the Alba field production platform, encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. The Gardenia
discovery well is located 11 miles southwest of the Alba Field. We are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries. We hold a 63 percent operated
interest in the Alba Block. 

        In
2004, we announced the results of the Corona well drilled on Block D offshore Equatorial Guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent working interest. The Corona well
confirmed an extension of the Alba field on to Block D. An application for an Area of Commercial Discovery was submitted prior to the end of the production sharing contract's exploration period, which
expired at the end of 2006. We are currently in discussions with the Equatorial Guinea government regarding our rights to develop the Block D extension of the Alba Field. 


        Libya  –  We hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass
almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2006 included the drilling of 12 wells, nine of which were successful. Most of these discoveries extended
previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. 

        Canada  –  We are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the Annapolis lease offshore Nova
Scotia, where we continue to evaluate further drilling. In late 2006, we decided to withdraw from the adjacent Cortland lease, where we hold a 75 percent interest, and the adjacent Empire
lease, where we hold a 50 percent interest. As a result of this withdrawal, a charge equal to 25 percent of the remaining work commitment, or $47 million, was recorded as
exploration expense in 2006 and the cash payment will be due to the Canadian provincial government in 2007. 

        Indonesia  –  We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block offshore
Indonesia. The 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, directly east of the Kutei Basin oil and natural
gas production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006. We expect to begin collecting geophysical data in 2007, followed by exploratory drilling in
2008 and 2009. 

Production (including development activities)  

        United States  –  Our U.S. operation accounted for 34 percent of our 2006 worldwide net liquid
hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations and 63 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. 


        During
2006, our net sales in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 35 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 46 percent of our total U.S. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 43 mmcfd of
natural gas, representing 8 percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales in the Gulf of Mexico increased slightly from the prior year, mainly due to the effects
of five tropical storms/hurricanes in 2005. Net natural gas sales decreased by 41 mmcfd from the prior year primarily because natural gas sales from the Camden Hills field ended in early 2006 as a
result of increased water production. At year-end 2006, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, of which four platforms are operated by
Marathon. 

        The
majority of our sales in the Gulf of Mexico comes from the Petronius development in Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. We own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in these
blocks. The platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. For example, Petronius processes the production from our Perseus field which commenced production
in April 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. 

4 




 


        We
hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the Neptune deepwater development on Atwater Valley Blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the Gulf of Mexico, 120 miles off the
coast of Louisiana. The initial development plan for Neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. Construction of
the platform and facility continued through 2006 with first production expected in early 2008. 

        We
are one of the largest natural gas producers in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. In 2006, our Alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 156 mmcfd, representing
29 percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales. Our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing
during the fourth and first quarters. In May 2006, upon receipt of regulatory approvals, we began to produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas
field. The natural gas in storage will be used to manage supplies to meet contractual demand. In addition to our operations in other established Alaskan fields, production from the Ninilchik field
began in 2003 and development continues on the field. Ninilchik natural gas is transported through the 35-mile portion of the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline which connects Ninilchik to the
existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the Kenai Peninsula, in Anchorage and in other parts of south central Alaska. We operate Ninilchik
and own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline described above. Our 2006 development program in the Cook Inlet included participation in the drilling of
seven wells. 

        Net
liquid hydrocarbon sales from our Wyoming fields averaged 21 mbpd in 2006 and 2005. Net natural gas sales from our Wyoming fields averaged 119 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 107 mmcfd in
2005. The increase in our
Wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily attributed to higher net sales from the Powder River Basin, which averaged 77 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 66 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of 2005 drilling
activity. Development of the Powder River Basin continued in 2006 with 119 wells drilled, which was down from the 195 wells drilled in 2005 due to project delays primarily caused by regulatory and
produced water management issues. Additional development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2006 where we participated in the drilling of 27 wells. 

        Net
natural gas sales from our Oklahoma fields averaged 87 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 77 mmcfd in 2005 primarily as a result of development and exploratory drilling. Our 2006 development
program continued to focus in the Anadarko Basin where we participated in the drilling of 75 wells. 

        Net
natural gas sales from our east Texas and north Louisiana fields averaged 71 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 75 mmcfd in 2005. This decrease is primarily attributable to sour gas handling
capacity limits at the natural gas plants that purchase our east Texas natural gas, partially offset by development drilling results. Active development of the Mimms Creek field in east Texas
continued in 2006. 

        Net
liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Permian Basin region, which extends from southeast New Mexico to west Texas, averaged 14 mbpd in 2006 compared to 16 mbpd in 2005. This decrease in
net sales was due to natural field declines partially offset by development project results in the Indian Basin and Drinkard areas of southeast New Mexico. 

        In
the first half of 2006, we completed leasehold acquisitions totaling approximately 200,000 acres in the Bakken Shale oil play. The majority of the acreage is located in North Dakota
with the remainder in eastern Montana. We now own a substantial position in the Bakken Shale with approximately 300 locations to be drilled over the next five years. Our initial focus has been to
evaluate our leasehold position. 

        In
July 2006, we completed a natural gas leasehold acquisition in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater Grand Valley field complex. The acreage
is located near adjacent production. Our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells over the next ten years with first production expected in late 2007. 

        We
continue to assess our acreage position in the Barnett Shale gas play in north central Texas. To date, we have leased approximately 85,000 net acres in two counties. One core well and
five horizontal wells have been drilled and completion activity is underway on these first wells. Seismic data was acquired in 2006 and is being evaluated. 

        United Kingdom  –  Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where
we are the operator and have a 42 percent interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities
host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field are gas condensate fields.
Our share of sales from the Brae area averaged 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 18 mbpd in 2005. This reduction primarily resulted from West Brae field decline and the timing of
sales of liquid hydrocarbons. Our share of Brae natural gas sales averaged 151 mmcfd, which was lower than the 169 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of natural field declines in the North and East Brae gas
condensate fields. 

5 




 


        The
strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, there
are 28 third-party fields contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area
operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. 

        The
Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation ("SAGE") system. The SAGE pipeline transports gas from the Brae and the third-party
Beryl areas and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE
pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the third-party Britannia field. 


        In
the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own an approximate 30 percent interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main
Foinaven field, 47 percent of East Foinaven and 20 percent of the T35 and T25 accumulations. Our share of sales from the Foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10
mmcfd of natural gas in 2006, compared to 16 mbpd and 9 mmcfd in 2005, primarily as a result of increased liquid handling capacity following facility modifications, increased well potential and
improved operating efficiency. 

        Norway  –  Norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing
operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed above. We were approved for our first operatorship on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses. 

        During
2006, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in Norway from the Heimdal, Vale and Skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 36 mmcfd. We own a 24 percent outside-operated
interest in the Heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the Vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Skirne field. 

        We
are the operator of the Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development is comprised of the Kameleon and Kneler discoveries, in which we have a
65 percent interest, and the Boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent interest. During 2004, we received approval from the Norwegian authorities for our Alvheim plan for development
and operation ("PDO"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("FPSO") with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. The PDO also
outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the SAGE system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline.
Marathon and its Alvheim project partners acquired the Odin multipurpose shuttle tanker early
in 2005. The vessel is currently being modified to serve as an FPSO and has been renamed "Alvheim." In 2004, the Alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby Vilje discovery, in
which we own a 47 percent outside-operated interest, subject to the approval of the Norwegian government. In 2005, the Norwegian government approved the Vilje PDO. Progress also continues on
the Vilje project, where the subsea preparation is 98 percent complete and development drilling is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2007. First production from the Alvheim/Vilje
development is expected during the second quarter of 2007. Four wells will be available at first production and drilling activities will continue into 2008. A peak net rate of approximately 75,000
boepd is expected in early 2008. 

        In
2006, we submitted a PDO for the Volund field to the Norwegian government, with a recommendation that the field be developed as a subsea tie-back to the Alvheim FPSO. In
December 2006, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy forwarded the PDO to the Norwegian King in Council for approval. Approval was received in early 2007. The Volund development will include
three producing wells and a water injection well. The crude oil production will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above and the associated natural gas will be exported via the
Alvheim-to-SAGE pipeline. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in the second quarter of
2009. 

        Ireland  –  We own a 100 percent interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale
fields in the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. In February 2006, we acquired an 87 percent operated interest in the Seven Heads natural gas field. Previously, we processed and transported
natural gas and we provided field operating services to the Seven Heads group through our existing Kinsale Head facilities. Net natural gas sales in Ireland were 46 mmcfd in 2006, compared with 50
mmcfd in 2005. In June 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in Ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the Southwest Kinsale
field. In 2006, we began to produce and hold in storage natural gas from the Kinsale Head field for future delivery under a contract that expires in March 2009. Additionally, natural gas
produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at Southwest Kinsale for future sale to customers. 


        We
own a 19 percent interest in the outside-operated Corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off Ireland's northwest coast, where five of the seven wells
necessary to develop the field have been drilled. During 2004, 

6 




 


An
Bord Pleanála (the Planning Board) upheld the Mayo County Council's decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge, County Mayo, which
will process natural gas from the Corrib field. Development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended to facilitate dialogue and clarification of issues raised by opponents of the project. In
July 2006, the partners in this project accepted the findings of a government-commissioned independent safety review and the report of an independent mediator regarding the onshore pipeline
associated with the proposed development. The onshore pipeline will be re-routed and routing studies are underway. Construction of the natural gas plant re-commenced in the
third quarter of 2006. First production from the field is expected in 2009. 

        Equatorial Guinea  –  We own a 63 percent operated interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial
Guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") processing plant held through an equity method investee. During 2006, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 48
mbpd and net natural gas sales averaged 68 mmcfd, compared to 40 mbpd and 92 mmcfd in 2005. A condensate expansion project ramped up to full production and a new, larger LPG plant was completed in
2005. Net sales in 2006 averaged 36 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of LPG. 

        We
own 45 percent of Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC ("AMPCO"), the results of which are included in the Integrated Gas segment. In 2006, we supplied a gross 99 mmcfd of
dry gas, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed, to AMPCO, where it was used to manufacture methanol. Remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for
later production when the LNG production facility on Bioko Island, discussed below under Integrated Gas, is completed. 


        Libya  –  Net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya averaged 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd
were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in Libya. The 2006 sales in Libya represented 37 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations.
We continue to work with our partners to define and implement growth plans for this business. 

        Gabon  –  We are the operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore
Gabon with a 56 percent interest. Net sales in Gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 12 mbpd in 2005. Production from these three fields is processed on a single
offshore facility at Tchatamba Marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. 

        Russia  –  During 2003 we acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation which operated oil fields located in
the Khanty Mansiysk region of western Siberia. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales were primarily from the East Kamennoye and Potenay fields. In June 2006, we sold these Russian oil exploration and
production businesses. 

Other Matters  

        We hold an interest in an exploration and production license in Sudan. We suspended all operations in Sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. We have had no employees
in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to Sudan
since then. We have abided and will continue to abide by all U.S. sanctions related to Sudan and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our interests there until such time as it is
permitted under U.S. law. Our intention is to exit this license in 2007. 


        We
discovered the Ash Shaer and Cherrife gas fields in Syria in the 1980s. We have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in Syria and we impaired our entire investment in
Syria in 1998. In July 2006, the new production sharing contract awarded by the Syrian government was signed into law. This contract gave us the right to assign all or part of our interest in
these fields to a third party, subject to the consent of the Syrian government, and also resolved the previous disputes between us, the Syrian Petroleum Company and the Syrian government over our
interest in these fields. In October 2006, the Syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the Ash Shaer and Cherrife natural gas fields to a
non-U.S. company. We closed the transaction on November 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. While we continue to hold a 10 percent outside-operated
interest, we continue to comply with all U.S. sanctions related to Syria. We expect to sell the remaining 10 percent interest in 2007. 

        The
above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the
Gudrun field offshore Norway and Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, the timing of production from the Neptune development, the Piceance Basin, the Alvheim/Vilje development, the Volund field and the
Corrib project. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration
and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other
geological, operating and 

7 




 


economic
considerations. Except for the Alvheim/Vilje and Volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining
necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The possible developments on the Gudrun field and Blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and
character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements. 

Reserves  

        At December 31, 2006, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.262 billion boe, of which approximately 40 percent
were located in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") countries. The following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of
each of the last three years.

(a)Represents
Marathon's Russian businesses, which were sold in 2006. 


        Proved developed reserves represented 68 percent of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2006, as compared to 71 percent
as of December 31, 2005. Of the 405 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2006, less than 10 percent of the volume is associated with projects that
have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 11 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2006. 


        During
2006, we added a total of 146 million boe of net proved reserves, principally in Libya and Equatorial Guinea. We disposed of 45 million boe, while producing
134 million boe. Of the total net proved reserve additions, 82 million boe were proved developed and 64 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. During 2006, we transferred
18 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Costs incurred for the periods ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 relating to the development of proved
undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves, were $1.010 billion, $955 million and $708 million. As of December 31, 2006, estimated future development costs relating to the
development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2007 through 2009 are projected to be $466 million, $348 million and $231 million. 

8 




 


        Our
Libyan fields had the most significant positive changes, totaling 69 million boe. This included positive revisions due to access to additional data and our improved
understanding of reservoir performance during the first year after our re-entry and additions for future development drilling. At the end of 2006, our proved reserves associated with Libya
totaled 214 million boe, or 17 percent of our total proved reserves. Additionally, 21 million boe were added to our proved reserves for the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea,
primarily as a result of expanded natural gas marketing and supply agreements. 

        The
above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas
reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the
reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating
considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. 

        For
a discussion of the proved reserve estimation process, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical
Accounting Estimates – Estimated Net Recoverable Quantities of Oil and Natural Gas, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of
the last three years, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of
Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on pages F-46 through F-47. We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") for the years 2005 and 2004 disclosing
the year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We will file a similar report for 2006. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the same as the estimates
reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities. 

Delivery Commitments  

        We have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. 

        In
Alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local utility companies, which obligate us to supply 124 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these contracts,
which terminate in 2012 and 2018. In addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska LNG plant and a proportionate share of the long-term LNG sales obligation to two
Japanese utility companies. This obligation is estimated to total 43 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in 2009. These commitments are structured with variable-pricing
terms. Our production from various natural gas fields in the Cook Inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Our proved reserves in the Cook Inlet are sufficient to meet these
contractual obligations. 

        In
the U.K., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply 125 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these contracts,
which terminate in 2009. Our Brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. Pricing under these natural
gas sales contracts is variable. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contracts.

        Our RM&T operations are primarily conducted by MPC and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries Speedway SuperAmerica LLC ("SSA")
and Marathon Pipe Line LLC. 

Refining  

        We own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 974 mbpd of crude oil. During 2006, our refineries processed 980 mbpd of crude oil and
234 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks for a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 101 percent. The table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our
refineries as of December 31, 2006.

        Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur
recovery units. The refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel
fuel. We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. We manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and
refractory industries. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. 


        Our
refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of
intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available.
By shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. 

        Planned
maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. We completed a major
turnaround at our Catlettsburg refinery in 2006. 

        The
following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years.

        We completed all of our ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel modifications required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to its
June 1, 2006 deadline. These modifications were completed on time and under budget.

        In
2006, our Board of Directors approved a projected $3.2 billion expansion of our Garyville, Louisiana refinery by 180 mbpd to 425 mbpd, which will increase our total refining
capacity to 1.154 million barrels per day ("mmbpd"). We recently received air permit approval from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for this project and construction is
expected to begin in mid-2007, with startup planned for the fourth quarter of 2009. 

        We
have also commenced front-end engineering and design ("FEED") for a potential heavy oil upgrading project at our Detroit refinery, which would allow us to process
increased volumes of Canadian oil sands production, and are undertaking a feasibility study for a similar upgrading project at our Catlettsburg refinery. 


Marketing  

        We are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United
States. In 2006, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.5 billion gallons, or 1.401 mmbpd. The average sales price of our refined products in
aggregate was $77.76 per barrel for 2006. The following table sets forth our refined product sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years.

(a)Includes
matching buy/sell volumes of 24 mbpd, 77 mbpd and 71 mbpd in 2006, 2005 and 2004. On April 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell
arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. This change resulted in lower refined product sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under the previous accounting
practices. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 

        The wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot
market accounted for 71 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. We sold 52 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale
or spot market basis. Half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are
domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the United States and Canada, with pitch products also
being exported worldwide. We market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States. Our customer base includes approximately
800 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. 


        We
blended 35 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2006. In 2005 and 2004, we blended 35 mbpd and 30 mbpd of ethanol. The expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be
driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville,
Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. 

        As
of December 31, 2006, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,200 Marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded
retail outlets are also located in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Alabama and South Carolina. Sales to Marathon brand jobbers
and dealers accounted for 14 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. 

        SSA
sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. Sales of refined products through these SSA retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined
product sales volumes in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, SSA had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under
the brand names "Speedway" and "SuperAmerica." SSA's revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.7 billion in 2006, compared with $2.5 billion in 2005.
Profit levels from the sale 

14 




 


of
such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. SSA also operates 60 Valvoline Instant Oil Change retail outlets located
in Michigan and northwest Ohio. 

        Pilot
Travel Centers LLC ("PTC"), our joint venture with Pilot Corporation ("Pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the United States with 269 locations in 37 states and
Canada at December 31, 2006. In 2006, PTC expanded internationally with the opening of a site in Ontario, Canada. The travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services,
including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. Pilot and Marathon each own a 50 percent interest in PTC. 

        Our
retail marketing strategy is focused on SSA's Midwest operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand and continued growth for PTC. 

Supply and Transportation  

        We obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. In 2006, U.S. sourced crude oil averaged 470
mbpd, or 48 percent of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 14 mbpd from our production operations. In 2006, Canada was the source for 13 percent, or 130 mbpd of
crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 39 percent, or 380 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 198 mbpd from the Middle East. This crude oil was
acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. The following table provides information on the sources of crude for each of the last three years.

•50 percent
interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products system connecting Gulf Coast refineries with the Midwest market;
•37 percent
interest in the Capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois;
•17 percent
interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest;
•17 percent
interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from Clearbrook, Minnesota to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in
the vicinity of our St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery; and
•6 percent
interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois to Toledo, Ohio. 


        Our
87 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a
combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and trucks. Our marine transportation operations include towboats (15 owned) and barges (180 owned, 4 leased) that transport refined products on the Ohio,
Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. We lease and own over 2,000 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products
and over 100 tractors and tank trailers. 

Ethanol Production  

        In 2006, we signed a definitive agreement forming a 50/50 joint venture that will construct and operate one or more ethanol production plants. Our partner in the
joint venture will provide the day-to-day management of the plants, as well as grain procurement, distillers dried grain marketing and ethanol management services. This venture
will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. Together with our partner, we selected the venture's initial plant site, Greenville, Ohio, and construction has
commenced on a 110 million gallon per year ethanol facility. The facility is expected to be operational as soon as the first quarter of 2008. 

        The
above discussion of the RM&T segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the Garyville refinery, potential heavy oil refining upgrading projects
and a joint venture that would construct and operate ethanol plants. Some factors that could affect the Garyville expansion project and the ethanol plant construction, management and development
include necessary government and third party approvals, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily
associated with construction projects. The Garyville project may be further affected by crude oil supply. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the heavy oil refining upgrading projects include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements, results of
front-end engineering and design work, approval of our Board of Directors, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, continued favorable investment
climate, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. 


Other  

        The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a Renewable Fuel Standard ("RFS") providing that all gasoline sold in the United States contain a minimum of
4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. The RFS increases
gradually each year until 2012, when the RFS will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has published a proposed rule to implement the RFS,
and we anticipate that a final rule will be published in mid-2007. Federal legislation may be proposed in 2007 which may require even greater quantities of renewable fuels. Marathon
intends to comply with all regulations that are adopted.

NAME="di5177_integrated_gas"> 
 
Integrated Gas        

        Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations, methanol operations, and certain other gas processing
facilities. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key
demand areas. 

16 




 


Alaska LNG  

        We own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in
Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, the LNG has been sold under a long-term
contract with two of Japan's largest utility companies. This contract continues through March 2009, with 2006 LNG deliveries totaling 61 gross bcf (19 net bcf). In January 2007, along
with our partner, we filed a request with the U.S. Department of Energy to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through March 2011. 

Equatorial Guinea LNG  

        In 2004, we and our partner, Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Ecuatorial (the National Oil Company of Equatorial Guinea or "GEPetrol"), through Equatorial
Guinea LNG Holdings Limited ("EGHoldings"), began construction of a 3.7 million metric ton per annum ("mmtpa") LNG production facility on Bioko Island. We expect to begin delivering 3.4 mmtpa,
or 460 mmcfd, during the second quarter of 2007 under a 17-year sales and purchase agreement. The purchaser under this agreement will take delivery of the LNG facility's production on an
FOB Bioko Island basis with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This project will allow us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as
natural gas for the production facility will be purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. We are currently seeking additional natural gas
supplies to allow full utilization of this LNG facility, which is designed to have a higher capacity and a longer life than the current 17-year sales and purchase agreement. 

        In
July 2005, Marathon and GEPetrol entered into agreements under which Mitsui & Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui") and a subsidiary of Marubeni Corporation ("Marubeni") acquired
8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests in EGHoldings. In November 2006, GEPetrol transferred its 25 percent interest to Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial
("SONAGAS"), which is also controlled by the government of Equatorial Guinea. Following these transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, with SONAGAS holding a 25 percent
interest and Mitsui and Marubeni holding the remaining interests. 

        In
2006, with our project partners, we awarded a FEED contract for initial work related to a potential second LNG production facility on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. The FEED work is
expected to be completed during 2007. The scope of the FEED work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa LNG project includes feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil off gas
compression, product transfer to storage and LNG product metering. A final investment decision is expected in early 2008. 


Elba Island LNG  

        In April 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes at the Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification terminal pursuant to an LNG sales and purchase agreement.
Under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as LNG) per year, through March 31, 2021 with a possible extension to November 30,
2023. 

        In
September 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five years. The agreement allows for
delivery of LNG at the Elba Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the Henry Hub index. This supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at Elba Island during the period
of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. The agreement commenced in 2005. 

Methanol  

        We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our
natural gas production in the Alba field. Methanol sales totaled 733,680 gross metric tons (330,156 net metric tons) in 2006. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the
United States. 

Gas Technology  

        We invest in natural gas technology research, including gas-to-liquids ("GTL") technology which offers the ability to
convert natural gas into premium fuels. In addition to GTL, we continue to evaluate application of gas technologies accessible through licenses, including methanol-to-power and
compressed natural gas. We also continue to develop a 

17 




 


proprietary
gas-to-fuels ("GTF") technology, which can be configured to convert natural gas resources into premium fuels. 


        The
above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the LNG production facility and
the possible expansion thereof. Factors that could affect the LNG production facility include unforeseen problems arising from commissioning of the facilities, unforeseen hazards such as weather
conditions and other operating considerations such as shipping the LNG. In addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current LNG production
facility and the development of additional LNG capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations
with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. 

<A
NAME="di5177_competition_and_market_conditions"> 
 
Competition and Market Conditions        

        Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. We
compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these
companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and
other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or
commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based on industry sources, we
currently rank ninth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. 

        We
must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. We
rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2006. We compete in four distinct markets – wholesale, spot,
branded and retail distribution – for the sale of refined products. We believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private
brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 70 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum
products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 260 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. We compete in the convenience store industry through SSA's retail outlets.
The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. Some locations
also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as Subway™. We also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in PTC. 

        Our
operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally,
results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases.
Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and
new and changing governmental regulations.

NAME="di5177_the_separation"> 
 
The Separation        

        On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon completed the
Separation, in which: 



•its
wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded
company; and
•USX
Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation. 


        As
a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. 

        In
connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after
the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of
two of those agreements. 

18 




 


Financial Matters Agreement  

        Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of Marathon's principal repayment, interest payment and other
obligations under the following, including any
amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by Marathon: 



•obligations
under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through
2033;
•sale-leaseback
financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel's Fairfield Works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012,
subject to extensions;
•obligations
relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel;
and
•certain
other guarantees. 


        The
financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for Marathon's discharge from any remaining
liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying Marathon an amount equal to the
remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. 

        Under
the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase
options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations
without the prior consent of Marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases. 


        The
financial matters agreement also requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee Marathon
provided with respect to all of United States Steel's obligations under a partnership agreement between United States Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit Corporation of Delaware and
Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the
partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. 


        The
financial matters agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a
default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. The agreement also obligates Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other
liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. 

        United
States Steel's obligations to Marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel's accounts payable and other
general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security
interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. 

Tax Sharing Agreement  

        Marathon and United States Steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. During 2006, the Internal Revenue
Service completed its review of all federal income tax returns filed by USX Corporation for taxable periods ending on or prior to the date of the Separation. Marathon and United States Steel have
settled all matters related to federal income taxes under this agreement. Remaining matters related to state and local income taxes are not expected to have any significant effect on Marathon. 

Obligations Associated with the Separation as of December 31, 2006  

        See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations Associated with the Separation of
United States Steel" for a discussion of our obligations associated with the Separation.

NAME="di5177_environmental_matters"> 
 
Environmental Matters        

        The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues identified
by management, including environmental matters. Our Corporate Responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems
that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. We also have
a Crisis Management Team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving Marathon or any of our properties. 

        Legislation
and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. The Kyoto Protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by
countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. Other climate change legislation and regulations both in the United States and abroad are in various stages of development. Although
there may be financial impact (including compliance costs) associated
with any legislation or regulation, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty of these measures. As part of our commitment to
environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In
addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. 

        Our
businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with
respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage
and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. New laws are being enacted and regulations
are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more
accurately defined. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of
others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is
not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These
environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased
capital, operating and compliance costs. 

        For
a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" and "Legal Proceedings." 

Air  

        Of particular significance to our refining operations were U.S. EPA regulations that required reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for
diesel fuel. We achieved compliance with these regulations and began production of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for on-road use prior to the June 1, 2006 deadline. The
cost of achieving compliance with these regulations was approximately $850 million. Marathon will also be spending approximately $250 million from 2006 through 2010 to produce
ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use. Further, Marathon estimates that it will spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in
2008 to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II regulations relating to benzene. This is a preliminary estimate as the Mobile Source Air Toxics II regulations should be finalized in the first half of
2007. 

        The
EPA has finalized new and revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for fine particulate emissions and ozone. In connection with these new standards, the EPA will
designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas, in January 2004, the EPA proposed a rule
called the Interstate Air Quality Rule ("IAQR") that would require significant reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions in numerous states. The final rule was promulgated on May 12, 2005, and the
rule was renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR"). While the EPA expects that states will meet their CAIR obligations by requiring emissions reductions from Electric Generating Units ("EGUs"),
states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. Our refinery operations are located in affected states and some states may choose to propose more stringent
fuels requirements to meet the CAIR 

20 





 


requirements;
however we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the CAIR until the states have taken further action. 

Water  

        We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to
oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank
vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of such releases OPA-90 requires responsible companies to pay
resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. 

        Additionally,
OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be
retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled
requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to
OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil
response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90. 

Solid Waste  

        We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous
wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground
storage tanks ("USTs") containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and
disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs are not expected to be material. 

Remediation  

        We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state
laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to
the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of
the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also
have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Legal Proceedings – Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a
discussion of these sites.

Item 1A. Risk Factors        


        Marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. The following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and
uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, as well as refined product gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely
impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.

        Prices
for oil and natural gas and refined product gross margins fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive
for our oil, natural gas and refined products. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors
influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. These factors include: 



•worldwide
and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;
•the
cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil, natural gas and refined products;
•the
ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain production controls;
•political
instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;
•changes
in weather patterns and climatic changes;
•natural
disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;
•the
price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;
•domestic
and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and
•general
economic conditions worldwide. 


        The
long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as on refined product gross margins, are uncertain. 

        Lower
oil and natural gas prices, as well as lower refined product gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating
income and cash flows. Significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices or refined product gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures and impair the carrying value of our
assets. 

Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the
estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves.

        The
proved oil and natural gas reserves information related to Marathon included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. Those estimates were prepared by our
in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. The
estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of December 31, 2006, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. Any significant future price changes will
have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance
and other production taxes. 

        Reserve
estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured.
Estimates of economically recoverable oil
and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: 



•location,
size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;
•historical
production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;
•the
assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;
•assumptions
concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and 


22 




 




•assumptions
concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. 


        As
a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future
net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other
factors estimated: 



•the
amount and timing of oil and natural gas production;
•the
revenues and costs associated with that production; and
•the
amount and timing of future development expenditures. 



        The
discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As
required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of
the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. 

        In
addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not
necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. 


If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of
operations and impairing our financial condition.

        The
rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing
proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or
secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the oil and natural gas we
produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: 



•obtaining
rights to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in promising areas;
•drilling
success;
•the
ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and
•the
ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. 


Increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product gross margins.

        The
profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling
prices we obtain for refined
products. We are a net purchaser of crude oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including
suppliers from the Middle East. These purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. Our overall RM&T
profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. Refined product gross margins
historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined
products. 

        In
addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly
requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refined product gross margins. 

If we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline.

        We
compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We
compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. In addition, in
implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in 

23 




 


bidding
for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. As a
consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as LNG production facilities. Many of our larger
competitors in the LNG market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. In
addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost
and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. 

We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a
result, our profitability could be materially reduced.

        Our
businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and
maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and
services, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and
location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform
site cleanups or curtail operations. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations
of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement
actions against us. 

        Our
operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries
caused by releases of hazardous substances. 

        Environmental
laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible
party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when
we performed them. 

Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.

        Local
political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 56 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2006
was derived from production outside the United States and approximately 72 percent of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2006, were located outside the United States. 


        There
are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing
and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. These risks include: 



•political
and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances;
•the
possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may
impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and
•fluctuating
currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. 


        Continued
hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries.
A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead
to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult
for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. 


        Actions
of the U.S. government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and
abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the 

24 




 


past
limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past
and will continue to do so in the future. 

Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by
unexpected liabilities.

        Our
exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather,
labor disputes and accidents. In addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such
as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of
pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions.
These hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Certain hazards have
adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in
one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. 

        We
maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and
liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. Historically, we have
maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. Due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of
insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses
from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased. 

If Ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of Ashland.


        As
a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in MPC from Ashland in 2005, Marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for
certain state taxes) of Ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. We have entered into a tax matters agreement with Ashland, which provides that: 



•we
will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of MPC and the other companies and businesses we acquired in
the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and
•Ashland
will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable
to Ashland's interest in MPC before the completion of the transactions. However, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by Ashland to various taxing
authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service. 


If
Ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. That would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification
from Ashland. In that event, our indemnification claims against Ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of Ashland,
and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from Ashland. 

Marathon is required to pay Ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of Ashland, which could be material.

        We
are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by Ashland after completion of the transactions. Under the tax matters agreement, we are
required to pay the benefit of those deductions to Ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two "baskets," as described below: 


Basket One – This applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a
maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. The benefit of Basket One deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of
the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). We are obligated to pay this
amount to Ashland. The computation and payment of Basket One amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in Basket One.
Upon specified events related to Ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would 

25 




 


otherwise
have been compensated under Basket One will be taken into account in Basket Two. In addition, Basket One applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits
attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under Basket Two. 

Because
we are required to make payments to Ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the Basket One contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to
Ashland with respect to Basket One contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. We are obligated to make these payments to Ashland even
if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. 

Basket Two – All contingent liability deductions relating to Ashland's pre-transactions operations that are not subject to
Basket One are considered and compensated under Basket Two. The benefit of Basket Two deductions is determined on a "with and without" basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated
as the last deductions used by the Marathon group. Thus, if the
Marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability
deductions. To the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the Marathon group through the use of the
contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to Ashland. Because Basket Two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the Marathon group from the use of Basket Two
deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the Marathon group's tax liability for a particular year. This could occur because of audit adjustments or
carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. To the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller Basket Two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for
which Ashland has already received compensation, Ashland is required to repay such compensation to Marathon. In the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks
associated with collecting an unsecured claim from Ashland. 

If the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in MPC that was previously owned by Ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return a portion of the interest in MPC, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on
us.

        In
a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of Ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with Ashland under state
fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. Under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering,
delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. If the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide
additional consideration to Ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired from Ashland. 

        Under
the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: 



•the
transferor received less than "reasonably equivalent value" or, in some jurisdictions, less than "fair consideration" or "valuable consideration;" and
•the
transferor:


•was
insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer;
•was
engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or
•intended
to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. 



        In
connection with our transactions with Ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of
$915 million) to Ashland's shareholders. In order to help establish that Ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written
opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that Ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of Ashland's interest in MPC and the other assets
we acquired. We also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and Ashland's representation to us that Ashland was not
insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. Those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various
assumptions, including assumptions relating to Ashland's existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. Although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) Ashland's
receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) Ashland's solvency, it should be noted that the 

26 




 


valuation
of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. 


If United States Steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment
could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition.

        In
connection with the separation of United States Steel from Marathon, United States Steel agreed to hold Marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. While we cannot
estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $564 million as of December 31, 2006, including accrued interest of
$11 million. If United States Steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from United States Steel. In that event, our
indemnification claims against United States Steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of United States Steel. 

        Under
applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by United States Steel in the performance of its obligations to fund its ERISA pension plans and pay other
obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. 

        United
States Steel's senior unsecured debt is rated non-investment grade by two major credit rating agencies. The steel business is highly competitive and a large number of
industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. The enforceability of our claims against United States Steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy,
fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors' rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the
facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. 

If the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by Marathon's former parent entity to Marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, United States
Steel's creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock.

        In
July 2001, USX Corporation ("Old USX") effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created Marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company
and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to Marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as United States Steel. 

        If
a court in a bankruptcy case regarding United States Steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance
or transfer law: 



•the
transfer by Old USX to Marathon or related transactions were undertaken by Old USX with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors;
or
•Old
USX received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or United
States Steel


•was
insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions,
•was
engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or
•intended
to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, 



then
that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of United States Steel to equitable relief from us. Such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors
to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. The measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the
law of the jurisdiction being applied. 

We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.

        Our
restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences,
powers and relative, participating, optional
and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of
preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all
events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of
preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.
