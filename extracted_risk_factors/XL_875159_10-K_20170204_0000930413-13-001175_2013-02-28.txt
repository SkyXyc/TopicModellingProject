History
XL Group plc, through its subsidiaries, is a global insurance and reinsurance company providing property, casualty and specialty products to industrial, commercial and professional firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. We were incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands
  Companies Act on March 16, 1998, as EXEL Merger Company. XL Capital Ltd was formed as a result of the merger of EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean Limited on August 7, 1998, and the company was named EXEL Limited on that date. At a special general meeting held on February 1, 1999, the shareholders of EXEL
  Limited approved a resolution changing the name of the company to XL Capital Ltd.
EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean Limited were incorporated in the Cayman Islands with principal operations in Bermuda in 1986 and 1992, respectively. On June 18, 1999, XL Capital Ltd merged with NAC Re Corp. (“NAC”), a Delaware corporation organized in 1985, in a stock merger.
On July 25, 2001, we acquired certain Winterthur International insurance operations (“Winterthur International”) to extend its predominantly North American-based large corporate insurance business globally.
Effective January 1, 2002, we increased our shareholding in Le Mans Ré from 49% to 67% in order to expand our international reinsurance operations. On September 3, 2003, we exercised our option to buy the remaining 33% from Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurances (“MMA”) and changed the name of Le Mans Ré to
  XL Re Europe S.A. On October 18, 2006, we received approval to form a new European company, XL Re Europe Ltd, based in Dublin, Ireland, which is licensed to write all classes of reinsurance business. XL Re Europe Ltd is the headquarters of the company’s European reinsurance platform with branch offices in France
  and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).
On August 4, 2006, we completed the sale of approximately 37% of our then financial guarantee reinsurance and insurance businesses through an initial public offering of 23.4 million common shares of Syncora Holdings Ltd. (“Syncora”) (formerly Security Capital Assurance Ltd. or “SCA”). On June 6, 2007, we
  completed the sale of an additional portion of Syncora’s common shares still owned by the company through a secondary offering and thereby reduced its ownership of Syncora’s outstanding common shares further from approximately 63% to approximately 46%. On August 5, 2008, we closed an agreement (the “Master
  Agreement”) with Syncora and its subsidiaries, as well as certain counterparties to credit default swap agreements, in connection with the termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements. As part of the Master Agreement, we transferred all of the shares we owned in Syncora to a trust and, as a result, have no further
  ownership interest in the company.
On July 1, 2010, XL Group plc, a newly formed Irish public limited company (“XL-Ireland”) and XL Capital Ltd (now known as XLIT Ltd.), an exempted company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“XL-Cayman”), completed a redomestication transaction in which all of the ordinary shares of XL-Cayman
  were exchanged for all of the ordinary shares of XL-Ireland (the “Redomestication”). As a result, XL-Cayman became a wholly-owned subsidiary of XL-Ireland. On July 23, 2010, the Irish High Court approved XL-Ireland’s creation of distributable reserves, subject to the completion of certain formalities under Irish Company
  law. These formalities were completed in early August 2010. For further detailed information on this transaction and its impacts on shareholder rights, shareholders’ equity, debt and notes then outstanding and employee stock plan awards, see the company’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
  Commission on July 1, 2010.
For periods prior to July 1, 2010, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” are to, and the Consolidated Financial Statements herein include the accounts of, XL-Cayman and its consolidated subsidiaries. For periods on and subsequent to July 1, 2010, unless the
  context otherwise indicates, references herein to the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” are to, and the Consolidated Financial Statements herein include, the accounts of, XL-Ireland and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Segments
We are organized into three operating segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Life operations. Our general investment and financing operations are reflected in Corporate.
We evaluate the performance of both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments based on underwriting profit and the performance of the Life operations segment based on its contribution to net income. Other items of our revenue and expenditure are not evaluated at the segment level for reporting purposes. In addition, we
  do not allocate investment assets of our property and casualty (“P&C”) operations to the other segments. Investment assets related to our Life operations and certain structured products included in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments are held in separately identified portfolios. As such, net investment income from these
  assets is included in the contribution from each of these operations.
The following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Additional financial information about our segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Item 8, Note 4, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated
  Financial Statements included herein.

Insurance Segment
General
Our insurance operations are organized into four business groups: International Property and Casualty, North America Property and Casualty, Global Professional Lines and Global Specialty Lines.
Our insurance operations provide customized insurance policies for complex corporate risks that may require large limits and are marketed and distributed through a wide variety of local, national and international producers. Large deductibles and self-insured retentions are incorporated into these policies to further manage
  risk along with stringent underwriting guidelines. While our insurance operations are known for insuring large complex risk, certain of our products are targeted to small and midsize companies and organizations, such as our professional liability and program business. We focus on those lines of business that we believe will
  provide the best return on capital over time.
The Insurance segment’s most significant operating legal entities in 2012 based on revenues were as follows: XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, XL Insurance Company Limited, XL Specialty Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Insurance Company, Greenwich Insurance Company and XL Insurance America, Inc., as well as
  certain Lloyd’s syndicates.
The excess nature of many of our insurance products, coupled with historically large policy limits, results in a book of business that can have losses characterized as low frequency and high severity. As a result, large losses, though infrequent, can have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition
  and liquidity. We attempt to mitigate this risk by, among other things, using strict underwriting guidelines, effective risk management practices (e.g., monitoring of aggregate exposures) and various reinsurance arrangements, as discussed below.
International Property and Casualty (“IPC”)
IPC includes the following lines of business: property, primary and excess casualty and environmental liability.
2



Property and casualty products are typically written as global insurance programs for large and medium sized multinational companies and institutions and include property and liability coverages. Property and casualty products generally provide large capacity on a primary, quota share or excess of loss basis. Global
  insurance programs are targeted to large multinational companies in major industry groups including aerospace, automotive, consumer products, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, high technology, telecommunications, transportation and basic metals. The primary casualty programs generally require customers to take large
  deductibles or self-insured retentions. For the excess business, our liability attaches after large deductibles, including self insurance or insurance layers provided by other companies. Policies are written on an occurrence, claims-made and occurrence reported basis. Our property business, which also includes construction projects,
  is short-tail by nature and written on both a primary and excess of loss basis. Property business includes exposures to man-made and natural disasters, and generally, loss experience is characterized as low frequency and high severity.
Environmental liability products include pollution and remediation legal liability, general and project-specific pollution and professional liability, and commercial general property redevelopment and contractor’s pollution liability. Business is written for both single and multiple years on a primary or excess of loss, claims-
  made or, less frequently, occurrence basis. Targeted industries include environmental service firms, contractors, healthcare facilities, manufacturing facilities, real estate development, transportation and construction.
North America Property and Casualty (“NAPC”)
NAPC includes the following lines of business: property, primary and excess casualty, environmental liability, excess and surplus lines, construction, surety and program business.
In addition to the property, casualty and environmental products described under IPC, the NAPC business unit also includes 100% property products for the large account risk engineered markets and general liability, U.S. workers’ compensation and auto liability for the risk management accounts, which require customers
  to take large deductibles or self-insured retentions.
Excess and surplus lines products include general liability property, excess auto and excess liability coverages where most Insurance Services Office, Inc. (“ISO”) products are written. Targets include a variety of classes, including rail roads with focus on “one-off” risks generated by contracted wholesale brokers.
Construction products include property coverages (builders risk, contractors equipment, property and inland marine), general liability, U.S. workers compensation and commercial auto, as well as professional liability for contractors and owner, excess umbrella, subcontractor default insurance and primary casualty wrap ups.
Surety products include contract bonds, including bid, performance, payment and contractor qualification bonds, as well as commercial surety bonds, including appeal, court and qualification bonds. Products in general provide large capacity and are written on a sole surety, co-surety or shared surety basis.
Our program business specializes in insurance coverages for distinct market segments in North America, including program administrators and managing general agents who operate in a specialized market niche and have unique industry backgrounds or specialized underwriting capabilities. Products encompass mostly
  property and casualty coverages.
Global Professional Lines (“Professional”)
Professional includes directors’ and officers’ liability, errors and omissions liability, employment practices liability and technology and cyber liability coverages. Policies are written on both a primary and excess of loss basis. Directors’ and officers’ coverage includes primary and excess directors’ and officers’ liability,
  employment practices liability and company securities and private company directors’ and officers’ liability. Products are targeted at a variety of different sized companies, with a heavy concentration on small to medium-sized firms when written on a primary basis. Employment practices liability is written primarily for very
  large corporations on an excess of loss basis and covers those firms for legal liability in regard to the treatment of employees. Errors and omissions coverage is written on a primary and excess basis.
3



Errors and omissions insurance written on a primary basis is targeted to small and medium-sized firms and coverage is provided for various professional exposures, including, but not limited to, architects and engineers, insurance brokers, consultants, lawyers, public entities and real estate agents.
Global Specialty Lines (“Specialty”)
Specialty includes the following lines of business: aviation and satellite, marine and offshore energy, fine art and specie, equine, product recall, political risk and trade credit and North America inland marine.
Aviation and satellite products include comprehensive airline hull and liability, airport liability, aviation manufacturers’ product liability, aviation ground handler liability, large aircraft hull and liability, corporate non-owned aircraft liability, space third party liability and satellite risk including damage or malfunction during
  ascent to orbit and continual operation, and aviation war. Aviation liability and physical damage coverage is offered for large aviation risks on a proportional basis, while smaller general aviation risks are offered on a primary basis. Satellite risks are generally written on a proportional basis. The target markets for aviation and
  satellite products include airlines, aviation product manufacturers, aircraft service firms, general aviation operators and telecommunications firms.
Marine and offshore energy coverage includes marine hull and machinery, marine war, marine excess liability, cargo and offshore energy insurance. Fine art and specie coverages include fine art and other collections, jewelers block, cash in transit and related coverages for financial institutions. Equine products specialize
  in providing bloodstock and livestock insurance. Product recall coverages include product contamination for the food and beverage sector and end-product consumer goods and product guarantee aimed at component part manufacturers.
In 2011, we launched underwriting capabilities for political risk and trade credit as well as North America inland marine business.
Also included as part of the Insurance segment is XL Global Asset Protection Services (“XL GAPS”), a fee for service loss prevention consulting service that offers individually tailored risk management solutions to risk managers, insurance brokers and insurance company clients operating on a global basis. Services are
  offered on an “unbundled” (services not tied to an insurance contract) and “bundled” basis.
Underwriting
We underwrite and price most risks individually following a review of the exposure and in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. Most of our insurance operations have underwriting guidelines that are industry-specific. We seek to serve our clients while controlling our exposure on individual insurance contracts
  through terms and conditions, policy limits and sublimits, attachment points and facultative and treaty reinsurance arrangements on certain types of risks.
Our underwriters generally evaluate each industry category and subgroups within each category. Premiums are set and adjusted for an insured based, in large part, on the industry group in which the insured is placed and the perceived risk of the insured relative to the other risks in that group. Rates may vary significantly
  according to the industry group of the insured as well as the insured’s risk relative to the group. Our rating methodology for individual insureds seeks to set premiums in accordance with claims potential as measured by past experience and future expectations, the attachment point and amount of underlying insurance, the
  nature and scope of the insured’s operations, exposures to loss, including natural hazard exposures, risk management quality and other specific risk factors relevant in the judgment of our underwriters to the type of business being written.
Underwriting and loss experience is reviewed regularly for, among other things, loss trends, emerging exposures, changes in the regulatory or legal environment as well as the efficacy of policy terms and conditions.
As our insurance products are primarily specialized coverages, underwriting guidelines and policy forms differ by product offering as well as by legal jurisdiction. Liability insurance is written on both a primary and excess of loss basis, on occurrence, occurrence reported and claims-made policy forms. Occurrence
  reported policies typically cover occurrences causing unexpected and unintended personal injury or property damage to third parties arising from events or conditions that commence at or subsequent to an 
4



inception date, or retroactive date, if applicable, and prior to the expiration of the policy provided that proper notice is given during the term of the policy or the discovery period. Claims-made policies typically cover only claims made during the policy period or extended reporting period and are generally associated with
  professional liability and environmental coverages. Traditional occurrence coverage is also available for restricted classes of risk and is generally written on a follow-form basis for excess of loss coverage, where the policy adopts the terms, conditions and exclusions of the underlying policy. Property insurance risks are written
  on a lead or follow-form basis that usually provides coverage for all risks of physical damage and business interruption. Maximum limits are generally subject to sublimits for coverage in critical earthquake and flood zones, where we seek to limit liability in these areas.
Engineering
Property engineering for our insurance operations includes conducting on-site inspections and consulting services related to loss prevention, reviews of building plans for fire protection design, Computer Assisted Drawings (diagrams) of facilities, recommendations on how to improve site protection, reviews of existing loss
  prevention reports/information for underwriters, summarizing multiple sources of information into an account summary, and providing underwriters an opinion on the risk to assist with risk selection, pricing and other underwriting decisions. The property engineering team consists of staff located in over 20 countries.
Other engineering resources support casualty, environmental, specialty and construction lines and serve as internal consultants to their respective underwriting teams, assisting them with making underwriting decisions, as well as helping their customers improve their local site or account protection.
Reinsurance Ceded
In certain cases, the risks assumed by us in the Insurance segment are partially reinsured by third party reinsurers. Reinsurance ceded varies by location and line of business based on a number of factors, including market conditions. The benefits of ceding risks to third party reinsurers include reducing exposure on
  individual risks, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling the writing of additional business. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge us from our liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured.
We use reinsurance to support the underwriting and retention guidelines of each of our subsidiaries as well as to control our aggregate exposure to a particular risk or class of risks. Reinsurance is purchased at several levels ranging from reinsurance of risks assumed on individual contracts to reinsurance covering the
  aggregate exposure on a portfolio of policies issued by groups of companies. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further information.
Premiums
Premium rates and underwriting terms and conditions for all lines of business written vary by jurisdiction principally due to local market conditions, competitor product offerings and legal requirements.

Marketing and Distribution
The majority of business in our Insurance segment originates via a large number of international, national and regional producers, acting as the brokers and representatives of current and prospective policyholders. This channel is supported by our Global Distribution and Network Unit, which consists of sales and
  marketing representatives in key markets throughout the world, representing all of our products in collaboration with the four business groups. A portion of Insurance segment business is also marketed and underwritten by general agents and a portion by independent agents acting on our behalf. Typically, all such producers,
  general agents and independent agents receive commission payments from us for their services, which are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium paid by the policyholder on an account-by-account basis. A certain portion of business originating from producers is submitted on a fee basis under which the producer is
  compensated by a fee paid to it by its policyholder client. From time to time, we also consider requests for commissions from a producer, with disclosure by the producer to the policyholder-client, where the producer receives a fee from the policyholder-client. We evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis.
We consider requests for contingent commission arrangements where such additional commissions are based upon the volume of bound business originated from a specific producer during a prior calendar year where legal and appropriate. Such arrangements are distinct from program business where additional commissions
  are generally based on profitability of business submitted to and bound by us.
With regard to excess and surplus lines business, we receive submissions from licensed wholesale surplus lines brokers.
We have no implied or explicit commitments to accept business from any particular broker, and neither producers nor any other third party have the authority to bind us, except in the case where underwriting authority may be delegated contractually to selected general agents. Such general agents are subject to a financial and
  operational due diligence review prior to any such delegation of authority and we conduct ongoing reviews and audits as deemed necessary with the goal of assuring the continuing integrity of underwriting and related business operations. See Item 8, Note 17(a), “Commitments and Contingencies – Concentrations of Credit Risk,” to
  the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for information on our major producers.
Apart from compensation arrangements established with producers in connection with insurance transactions, we also have engaged, and may in the future engage, certain producers or their affiliates in consulting roles pursuant to which such producers provide access to certain systems and information that may assist us
  with our marketing and distribution strategy. In instances where we engage producers in such consulting roles, we may compensate the relevant producers on a fixed fee basis, a variable fee basis based 
6



upon our usage of the systems and information proffered, or through a combination of fixed and variable fees.
Claims Administration
Claims management for our insurance operations includes the review of initial loss reports, administration of claims databases, generation of appropriate responses to claims reports, identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required and, where appropriate, retention of
  claims counsel, establishment of case reserves, payment of claims and notification to reinsurers. With respect to the establishment of case reserves, when we are notified of insured losses, our claims personnel record a case reserve as appropriate for the estimated amount of the exposure at that time. The estimate reflects the
  judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the
  general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process.
Claims in respect of business written by our Lloyd’s syndicates are primarily notified by various central market bureaus. Where a syndicate is a “leading” syndicate on a Lloyd’s policy, its underwriters and claims adjusters will work directly with the broker or insured on behalf of itself and the following market for any
  particular claim. This may involve appointing attorneys or loss adjusters. The claims bureaus and the leading syndicate advise movement in loss reserves to all syndicates participating on the risk. Our claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaus as deemed necessary.
Certain of our product lines have arrangements with third party administrators to provide claims handling services to us in respect of such product lines. These agreements set forth the duties of the third party administrators, limits of authority, protective indemnification language and various procedures that are required to
  meet statutory compliance. These arrangements are also subject to audit review by our relevant claim department.
Reinsurance Segment
General
Our Reinsurance segment is structured geographically into Bermuda operations, North American operations, European/Asia Pacific operations and Latin American operations.
This segment provides casualty, property risk, property catastrophe, marine, aviation, treaty and other specialty reinsurance on a global basis with business being written on both a proportional and non-proportional basis and also on a facultative basis. Our lines of business within the reinsurance segment continue to focus
  on those that provide the best return on capital. For our Reinsurance segment, given challenging market conditions and the changing economic environment experienced since 2008 this resulted, in certain instances, in a greater emphasis being placed on short-tail lines of business.
Business written on a non-proportional basis generally provides for an indemnification by us to the ceding company for a portion of losses, both individually and in the aggregate, on policies with limits in excess of a specified individual or aggregate loss deductible. For business written on a proportional basis, including
  on a “quota share” or “surplus” basis, we receive an agreed percentage of the premium and are liable for the same percentage of each and all incurred loss. For proportional business, the ceding company normally receives a ceding commission for the premiums ceded and may also, under certain circumstances, receive a profit
  commission based on performance of the contract. Occasionally this commission could be on a sliding scale depending on the loss ratio performance of the contract. Our casualty reinsurance includes general liability, professional liability, automobile and workers’ compensation. Professional liability includes directors’ and
  officers’, employment practices, medical malpractice and environmental liability. Casualty lines are written as treaties or programs and on both a proportional and a non-proportional basis. The treaty business includes clash programs, which cover a number of underlying policies involved in one occurrence or a judgment above
  an underlying policy’s limit, before suffering a loss.
7



Our property business, primarily short-tail in nature, is written on both a portfolio/treaty and individual/facultative basis and includes property catastrophe, property risk excess of loss and property proportional. A significant portion of the underwritten property business consists of large aggregate exposures to man-made
  and natural disasters and, generally, loss experience is characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
We seek to manage our reinsurance exposures to catastrophic events by limiting the amount of exposure written in each geographic or peril zone worldwide, underwriting in excess of varying attachment points and requiring that contracts exposed to catastrophe loss include aggregate limits. We also seek to protect our
  total aggregate exposures by peril and zone through the purchase of reinsurance programs.
Our property catastrophe reinsurance account is generally “all risk” in nature. As a result, we are exposed to losses from sources as diverse as hurricanes and other windstorms, earthquakes, freezing, riots, floods, industrial explosions, fires and many other potential natural or man-made disasters. In accordance with market
  practice, our policies generally exclude certain risks such as war, nuclear contamination or radiation. Following the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, “the September 11 event”), terrorism cover, including nuclear, biological,
  radiological and chemical has been restricted or excluded in many territories and classes. Some U.S. states require some cover for “Fire Following” terrorism and some countries make terrorism coverage mandatory. Our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage.
Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expenses from a single occurrence of a covered event exceed the attachment point specified in the policy. Some of our property catastrophe contracts limit coverage to one occurrence in any single
  policy year, but most contracts generally enable at least one reinstatement to be purchased by the reinsured.
We also write property risk excess of loss reinsurance. Property risk excess of loss reinsurance covers a loss to the reinsured on a single risk of the type reinsured rather than to aggregate losses for all covered risks on a specific peril, as is the case with catastrophe reinsurance. Our property proportional account includes
  reinsurance of direct property insurance. We seek to limit the catastrophe exposure from our proportional and per risk excess business through extensive use of occurrence and cession limits.
Other specialty reinsurance products include energy, marine, aviation, space, engineering, fidelity, surety, trade credit and political risk. We underwrite a small portfolio of contracts covering political risk and trade credit. Exposure is assumed from a limited number of trade credit contracts.
The segment’s most significant operating legal entities in 2012 based on revenues were as follows: XL Reinsurance America Inc., XL Re Europe Limited, XL Re Ltd and XL Re Latin America Ltd.
Underwriting
Underwriting risks for the reinsurance property and casualty business are evaluated using a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type and layer of risk to be assumed, the actuarial evaluation of premium adequacy, the cedant’s underwriting and claims experience, the cedant’s financial condition and claims
  paying rating, the exposure and/or experience with the cedant, and the line of business to be reinsured.
Other factors we assess include the reputation of the proposed cedant, the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share, a detailed evaluation of catastrophe and risk exposures, and historical loss data for the cedant, where available, and for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions in order
  to compare the cedant’s historical loss experience to industry averages. On-site underwriting and claim reviews are performed where it is deemed necessary to determine the quality of a current or prospective cedant’s underwriting operations, with particular emphasis on casualty proportional and working excess of loss
  placements.
For property catastrophe reinsurance business, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the amount of exposure we will directly underwrite for any one reinsured and the amount of the aggregate exposure to catastrophic losses in any one geographic zone. We believe that we have defined geographic and peril 
8



zones such that a single occurrence, for example, an earthquake or hurricane, should not affect more than one peril zone. While the exposure to multiple zones is considered remote for events such as a hurricane, we do manage our aggregate exposures for such a scenario where we consider it appropriate to do so. The
  definition of our peril zones is subject to periodic review. We also generally seek an attachment point for our property catastrophe reinsurance at a level that is high enough to produce a low frequency of loss. We seek to limit our aggregate exposure in the proportional business through extensive use of occurrence and cession
  limits.
Reinsurance Retroceded
We use third party reinsurance to support the underwriting and retention guidelines of each reinsurance subsidiary as well as to seek to limit our aggregate exposure to a particular risk or class of risks. Reinsurance is purchased at several levels ranging from reinsurance of risks assumed on individual contracts to
  reinsurance covering aggregate exposures. The benefits of ceding risks to other reinsurers include reducing exposure on individual risks, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling the writing of additional business. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge us from our liabilities
  in respect of the risk being reinsured. Reinsurance ceded varies by location and line of business based on factors including, among others, market conditions and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Our traditional catastrophe retrocession program was renewed in 2012 to cover certain of our exposures. These protections, in various layers and in excess of varying attachment points according to the territory exposed, assist in managing our net retention to an acceptable level. We have co-reinsurance retentions within
  this program.
We continue to buy additional protection for our marine and offshore energy exposures and in 2012 increased our retentions for these lines. We continue to buy specific reinsurance on our property and aviation portfolios to manage our net exposures in these classes.
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8, Note 9, “Reinsurance,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for further information.

  received from ceding companies with additional case reserves being established when deemed appropriate. Additionally, claims audits are conducted for specific claims and claims procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies, particularly in the United States and the U.K.
Life Operations Segment
During 2009, we completed a strategic review of our life reinsurance business. In relation to this initiative, during 2009 we sold the renewal rights to certain of our businesses, sold our U.S. life reinsurance business and announced that we would run-off our existing book of U.K. and Irish traditional life and annuity
  business, and not accept new business. In addition, in 2010, we consummated various transactions to novate and recapture U.K. and Irish term assurance and critical illness treaties and U.S. mortality retrocession pools. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into an agreement to recapture two small U.S. life
  reinsurance treaties.
The Life operations segment provided life reinsurance on business written by life insurance companies, principally to help them manage mortality, morbidity, survivorship, investment and lapse risks.
Prior to the decision to run-off the U.K. and Irish business, products offered included a broad range of underlying lines of life insurance business, including term assurances, group life, critical illness cover, immediate annuities and disability income. In addition, prior to selling the renewal rights, the products offered
  included short-term life, accident and health business. Notwithstanding these sales, the Life operations still covers a range of geographic markets, with an emphasis on the U.K., U.S., Ireland and Continental Europe.
The portfolio has three particularly significant components:
(1) The portfolio includes a small number of large contracts relating to closed blocks of U.K. and Irish fixed annuities in payment. In relation to certain of these contracts, we received cash and investment assets at the inception of the reinsurance contract, relating to the future policy benefit reserves assumed. These
  contracts are long-term in nature, and the expected claims payout period can span up to 30 or 40 years 
10



with average duration of around 10 years. We are exposed to investment and survivorship risk over the life of these arrangements.
(2) The second component of the portfolio relates to life risks (in the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland)), income protection risks (in the U.S.) and critical illness risks (in the U.K. and Ireland) where we are exposed to the mortality, morbidity and lapse experience from the underlying business, over the medium to long-term.
(3) The third component relates to the annually renewable business covering life, accident and health risks written in Continental Europe. These contracts are short-term in nature and include both proportional and non-proportional reinsurance structures. While the renewal rights for this business have been sold, the existing
  business remains with us.
Underwriting & Claims Administration
While the Life operations segment was closed to new business in March 2009, the pricing information below reflects how new business was acquired prior to that date and hence is relevant to the in-force portfolio of business.
Life reinsurance transactions fall into two distinct forms. The first relates to the reinsurance of an existing and closed block of risks (“in-force deal”), where the nature of the underlying exposure is known at the date of execution. The second relates to the reinsurance of liabilities that are yet to be written by the ceding
  company (“new business treaty”) where, provided the subsequent risks are within the agreed treaty parameters, these risks may be added to the portfolio.
The underwriting of an in-force deal is highly actuarial in nature, requiring detailed analytical appraisal of the key parameters that drive the ultimate profitability of the deal. This includes analysis of historic experience (claims, lapses, etc.) as well as the projection of these assumptions into the future.
When new business was written, in addition to the actuarial analysis required to set the terms, there was also a requirement to establish medical underwriting criteria that will apply to the new risks that may be added to the treaty. Once a treaty was accepted, there was then an ongoing need to monitor the risk selection
  by the medical underwriters at the ceding company and to ensure that the criteria were being met.
The Life operations team includes many members with specialized actuarial knowledge. Claims administration also relies on experienced team members and specific medical expertise, supported where required by third party medical underwriters and claims managers.
Reinsurance Retroceded
We purchase limited retrocession capacity on a “per-life” basis in the United States in order to cap the maximum claim arising from the death of a single individual. Cover is purchased from professional retrocessionaires that meet our criteria for counterparty exposures. Limited retrocession of fixed annuity business has
  been arranged to manage aggregate longevity capacity on specific deals. Limited retrocession of life, accident and health business on specific treaties written in Continental Europe has also been arranged to manage mortality and morbidity risks.

Competition
In regards to the Life operations segment, the core activity is in the United States, the U.K., Ireland and Continental Europe. While we no longer compete for new business, we retain an in-force portfolio and hence view companies with similar portfolios as competitors.
For the fixed annuity business, market participants include less traditional reinsurance entities, such as Canada Life and Prudential (U.K.) together with Swiss Re, Partner Re Ltd., Scor Global Life and Pacific Life Re, among others, who have entered or re-entered this market.
Marketing and Distribution
We no longer market or distribute new products in this segment.
Life Operations – Collateral Requirements
For certain blocks of Life operations’ business, we are required, under the terms of the relevant treaties, to hold collateral in favor of the underlying cedants. The amount of the collateral is typically determined in relation to the level that would be necessary to satisfy requirements in either the U.K. or U.S. regulatory
  regimes. These requirements are higher than is required under U.S. GAAP accounting requirements and hence the amounts are generally higher than the reserves reported herein. For the closed blocks of U.K. and Irish fixed annuities, under which assets were transferred to us, those assets are maintained in segregated
  investment portfolios subject to security and account control agreements in favor of the cedant. For the U.S. term life and income protection business, collateral is provided through a combination of letters of credit and assets held in trust to the benefit of the client.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses
Loss reserves are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of a loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses, we estimate future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events. Our reserving
  practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect our judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claim. Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves are established for reported claims (“case reserves”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
  claims.
The nature of our high excess of loss liability and catastrophe business can result in loss payments that are both irregular and significant. Similarly, adjustments to reserves for individual years can be irregular and significant. Such adjustments are part of the normal course of business for us. Certain aspects of our business
  have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
The tables below present the development of our unpaid losses and loss expense reserves on both a net and gross basis. The cumulative redundancy (deficiency) calculated on a net basis differs from that calculated on a gross basis. As different reinsurance programs cover different underwriting years, net and gross loss
  experience will not develop proportionately. The top lines of the tables show the estimated liability, net of reinsurance recoveries, as at the year end balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss expenses, including IBNR, arising in the current and all prior years
  that are unpaid at the year end balance sheet date of the indicated year. The tables show the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserve liability based on experience as of the year end balance sheet date of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and
  severity of claims for individual years. The cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents the aggregate change with respect to that liability originally estimated. The lower portion of the first table also reflects the cumulative paid losses relating to these reserves. Conditions and trends that have affected development of
  liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies into the future, based on the tables below. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Note Regarding
  Forward-Looking Statements.”

Current year net losses incurred
Current year net losses incurred decreased by $281.9 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. This was mainly as a result of the current year loss ratio excluding prior year development decreasing by 11.1 loss percentage points due to lower losses from natural catastrophes as compared to 2011. In addition, the current year
  loss ratio excluding natural catastrophes improved in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments due to lower large property risk losses, as well as business mix changes and other underwriting improvements.
Current year net losses incurred increased by $778.6 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This was mainly as a result of the current year loss ratio excluding prior year development increasing by 10.7 loss percentage points due to higher losses from natural catastrophes as compared to 2010, but also from the following:
  (i) the Insurance segment in 2011 experienced higher large loss activity in the energy, property and marine businesses, as compared to 2010; and (ii) the Reinsurance segment in 2011 experienced higher levels of large loss events in U.S. property, including a deterioration in the performance of a large U.S. agricultural
  program, higher attritional losses as well as business mix changes, as compared to 2010.
See the Income Statement Analysis at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further information regarding the current year loss ratios for each of the years indicated within each of our operating segments.
Prior year net losses incurred
The following tables present the development of our gross and net losses and loss expense reserves. The tables also show the estimated reserves at the beginning of each fiscal year and the favorable or adverse development (prior year development) of those reserves during such fiscal year.

As different reinsurance programs cover different underwriting years, contracts and lines of business, net and gross loss experience do not develop proportionately. In 2012, gross prior year favorable development exceeded net prior year favorable development in the Insurance segment due primarily to a significant
  reduction in a single large event in the International energy book that was heavily ceded. In 2011, gross prior year favorable development was in line with net prior year favorable development in total. However, during 2011, the Insurance segment experienced favorable net prior year development of $76.5 million compared to
  adverse gross prior year development of $23.1 million. The difference between net and gross development was driven primarily by adverse development related to large excess casualty claims associated with the Deepwater Horizon event in the 2010 accident year totaling $135.6 million on a gross basis, while the net impact
  was $33.4 million due to the offsetting impact of reinsurance protections. In addition, $150.0 million gross and $65.0 million net excess casualty IBNR reserves were reallocated to the 2010 accident year in respect of Deepwater Horizon exposures. These IBNR movements were entirely offset by reserve reductions in older
  accident years. This activity largely explains the difference between the gross and net prior year development for the Insurance segment in 2011 as well as the overall strengthening of the 2010 accident year reflected in the loss reserve development tables shown on the previous pages. During 2010, net prior year favorable
  development exceeded gross prior year favorable development due primarily to the Insurance segment from a single large claim in excess casualty that was heavily ceded.
The following table presents the gross and net (favorable) adverse prior year loss development of our loss and loss expense reserves by operating segment for each of the years indicated:

We had net favorable prior year reserve development in property and casualty operations of $315.9 million, $284.9 million and $372.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See the Income Statement Analysis at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 10, “Losses and Loss Expenses,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for further information regarding the developments in prior year loss reserve estimates for each of the years indicated within each of our operating segments.

Net loss reserves (disposed) acquired
We did not dispose of or acquire net loss reserves in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
Exchange rate effects
Exchange rate effects on net loss reserves in each of the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to our global operations primarily where reporting units have a functional currency that is not the U.S. dollar. In 2012, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the major currencies to which we are exposed,
  including the U.K. sterling, the Euro and the Swiss franc. In 2011, the U.S. dollar was stronger against U.K. sterling, the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Swiss franc, which more than offset losses that were driven by a stronger Australian dollar. In 2010, the U.S. dollar was stronger against the Euro, while weaker against the
  Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. These movements in the U.S. dollar gave rise to translation and revaluation exchange movements related to carried loss reserve balances of $156.2 million, $(130.5) million and $(125.1) million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Net paid losses
Total net paid losses were $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further information.
Other loss related information
Our net incurred losses and loss expenses include actual and estimates of potential non-recoveries from reinsurers. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the reserve for potential non-recoveries from reinsurers was $107.9 million and $99.2 million, respectively. For further information, see Item 8, Note 9, “Reinsurance,” to the
  Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Except for certain workers’ compensation (including long term disability) liabilities and certain U.K. motor liability claims, we do not discount our unpaid losses and loss expenses.
We utilize tabular reserving for workers’ compensation (including long-term disability) unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discount such losses using an interest rate of 5% in 2012 and 2011. The interest rate approximates the average yield to maturity on specific fixed income investments that
  support these liabilities. The tabular reserving methodology results in applying uniform and consistent criteria for establishing expected future indemnity and medical payments (including an explicit factor for medical inflation) and the use of mortality tables to determine expected payment periods. Tabular unpaid losses and loss
  expenses, net of reinsurance, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 on an undiscounted basis were $645.2 million and $612.9 million, respectively. The related discounted unpaid losses and loss expenses were $343.0 million and $290.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The Company records specific reserve allowance for Periodical Payment Orders (“PPO”) in the U.K. motor liabilities. This allowance includes the unpaid losses for claims already settled and notified as PPO at December 31, 2012, as well as the unpaid losses for claims to be settled in the future. The future care element
  of the unpaid losses were discounted using an interest rate of 1.5% at December 31, 2012 reduced from 2% at December 31, 2011 to reflect the increased reserve and the yields obtained on the additional purchase of assets. Unpaid losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 on an
  undiscounted basis were $240.0 million and $52.8 million, respectively. After discounting of the future care element the unpaid losses and loss expenses were $148.6 million and $29.6 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in net undiscounted unpaid losses and loss expenses between December 31,
  2011 and December 31, 2012 is explained in part by the identification of a proportion of the overall UK motor reserves that will settle as Periodical Payment claims in the future. This is in addition to a revision of the assumptions underlying the PPO reserve calculation and the worse than expected settlement of claims as
  PPOs during 2012.

Investments
Investment structure and strategy
Our investment operations are managed centrally by our Investment Group. The Risk and Finance Committee (the “RFC”) of the Board of Directors of XL-Ireland approves overall investment policy and guidelines, and reviews the implementation of the investment strategies on a regular basis.
Strategic Asset Allocation
The investment strategy for the investment portfolio is based on the strategic asset allocation (“SAA”) process, which establishes a benchmark for the aggregate investment portfolios supporting P&C investment operations and a separate benchmark for the aggregate investment portfolio supporting Life operations. These two
  benchmarks (“SAA Benchmarks”) are constructed to maximize company value subject to risk tolerance of management and various constraints, e.g., liability profile, local regulatory requirements, business needs, collateral management and insurance regulation. This process involves an integrated and stochastic model that
  includes our financial condition, reserve volatility and loss payout patterns, premium expense and loss ratio projections and correlations among asset, liabilities and economic variables.
As part of the implementation of our SAA Benchmarks, we employ a comprehensive framework of investment decision authorities (“Authorities Framework”). The objective of the Authorities Framework is to ensure that the risk profile of our investment portfolio is consistent with management’s risk tolerance as reflected
  in the SAA Benchmarks. The Authorities Framework controls active or tactical deviations from the SAA Benchmarks. As the magnitude of these deviations increases or the resulting impact on the risk profile of the investment portfolio reaches certain predetermined thresholds, additional levels of authority and approval are
  required, up to and including the RFC.
The RFC reviews and approves the SAA Benchmarks for P&C and Life operations and the Authorities Framework as part of the investment policy. Management approves further detailed investment authorities which integrate the Authorities Framework into our risk governance processes. We have an ongoing process that
  focuses on optimizing the composition of the P&C and Life portfolios relative to the SAA Benchmarks. See “Investment Portfolio Structure” for more details.
Investment Portfolio Structure
Our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities, equities, alternative investments, private investments, derivatives and other investments and cash. These securities and investments are denominated in U.S. dollar, U.K. sterling, Euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies.
Our direct use of investment derivatives includes futures, forwards, swaps and options that derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Our current investment policy allows derivatives to be used in the investment portfolio to reduce risk and enhance portfolio
  efficiency. Derivatives may not be used if they materially increase our investment risk.
At December 31, 2012 and 2011, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased), were $36.9 billion and $35.9 billion, respectively.
Functionally, our investment portfolio is divided into two principal components:
1) P&C investment portfolio: The larger component is the P&C investment portfolio and its principal objective is to support our insurance and reinsurance operations, the liabilities of which have some uncertainty as to the timing and/or amount. In addition, a smaller portion of the P&C investment portfolio supports corporate
  operations as well as run-off financial lines business, in which the liabilities have a greater level of certainty and much longer durations than typical P&C business.
The investment strategy for the P&C investment portfolio is based on the SAA process with a constrained total return mandate. The primary performance objective is for the total return of the P&C portfolio to meet or exceed the return of the SAA Benchmark with realized loss constraints. The second performance objective
  is capital preservation through managing the risk profile of the investment portfolio within management’s risk tolerance. The third performance objective is achieving the budget for net investment income.
17



2) Life operations investment portfolio: The second component of the investment portfolio is the Life operations investment portfolio. The principal objective of the Life operations investment portfolio is to support our Life operations, which are now in run-off. The largest portion of the Life operations investment portfolio
  supports the policy benefit reserves associated with asset annuity transactions, with limited uncertainty as to the timing or amount of the liability cash flows. A smaller portion of the Life operations investment portfolio supports life annuity liabilities that were assumed without portfolio asset transfer.
As discussed above, the investment strategy for the Life operations investment portfolio is based on the SAA process. The Life operations investment portfolio SAA process incorporates an additional overlay of the regulatory capital model and a more extensive focus on asset-liability management, which is possible due to
  the lower volatility of life liabilities relative to P&C liabilities.
The primary performance objective for the investments supporting the asset annuity transactions is to achieve a steady credit-adjusted book yield of the Life operations investment portfolio in order to maximize the embedded value and minimize statutory capital needs (owing to unique technical requirements of the
  statutory capital model). For the investments supporting the other portions of the Life operations investment portfolio, which do not have this unique capital model, the performance objective is for the constrained total return to at least match the total return of the benchmark, similar to that used in the P&C investment portfolio.
Implementation of investment strategy
Although our management within the Investment Group is responsible for implementation of the investment strategy, the day-to-day management of our investment portfolio is outsourced to investment management service providers in accordance with detailed investment guidelines provided and monitored by us. This
  approach gives us access to top investment talent with specialized skills across a broad range of investment products and provides flexibility to actively manage the structure of the portfolio as dictated by our business needs. Investment management service providers are selected directly on the basis of various criteria including
  investment style, track record, performance, risk management capabilities, internal controls, operational risk management and diversification implications. The vast majority of our investment portfolio is managed by large, well-established asset management institutions, while a small portion of the portfolio is managed by asset
  management specialist firms or boutiques. Each investment management service provider may manage one or more portfolios, each of which is generally governed by a detailed set of investment guidelines, including overall objectives, risk limits (where appropriate) and diversification requirements that fall within our overall
  investment policies and guidelines, including but not limited to exposures to eligible securities, prohibited investments/transactions, credit quality and general concentration limits. The Investment Group has a surveillance program to manage the aggregation of individual manager portfolios relative to the SAA Benchmarks.
Investment performance
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Investment Performance,” for discussion of our investment performance.
Investment portfolio credit ratings, duration and maturity profile
It is our policy to operate the combined P&C and Life (“aggregate”) fixed income portfolio with a minimum weighted average credit rating of Aa3/AA-. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for discussion on ratings downgrades. The aggregate credit rating is determined based on the weighted average rating of securities, where the
  average credit rating, where available, from Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) is allocated to each security. The weighted average credit rating of the aggregate fixed income portfolio was Aa2/AA at December 31, 2012 and 2011. U.S. agencies and Agency RMBS
  paper, whether with implicit or explicit government support, reflect the credit quality rating of the U.S. government for the purpose of these calculations.
We did not have an aggregate direct investment in a single corporate issuer in excess of 5% of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2012 or 2011. Corporate issuers represent our direct exposure to fixed maturities and short-term investments of the parent issuer and its subsidiaries. These exposures exclude 
18



asset and mortgage-backed securities that were issued, sponsored or serviced by the parent and government-guaranteed issues, but does include covered bonds. The Company invests in covered bonds issued by financial institutions (“Covered Bonds”). Covered Bonds are senior secured debt instruments issued by financial
  institutions and backed by over-collateralized pools of public sector or mortgage loans.
The overall duration and currency denomination of the aggregate fixed income portfolio is managed relative to the respective SAA Benchmarks for the P&C and Life operations investment portfolios, both of which incorporate matching currency and duration within a range relative to liabilities. Duration measures bond price
  volatility and is an indicator of the sensitivity of the price of a bond (or a portfolio of bonds) to changes in interest rates, assuming a parallel change in all global yield curves reflecting the percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in yield. Management believes that the duration of the aggregate fixed income
  portfolio is the best single measure of interest rate risk for the aggregate fixed income portfolio.
The maturity profile of the aggregate fixed income portfolio is a function of the maturity profile of estimated loss payments from our liabilities, our capital and expected operating cash flows and, to a lesser extent, the maturity profile of common fixed income benchmarks. For further information on the maturity profile of
  the fixed income portfolio, see Item 8, Note 5, “Investments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Enterprise Risk Management
Risk Management Framework
We face strategic and operational risks related to, among others: underwriting activities, financial reporting, changing macroeconomic conditions, investment risks, reserving estimates, changes in laws or regulations, information systems, business interruption and fraud. Our global P&C business, Life operations (which is in
  run-off) and investment portfolios each have their own set of risks (see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of such risks). From time to time, these risks may exhibit greater levels of correlation than might be expected over the longer term due to the presence of, to a greater or lesser degree, some common internal or
  external risk drivers embedded in our businesses that may manifest themselves simultaneously. An enterprise view of risk is required to identify and manage the consequences of these common risks and risk drivers on our profitability, capital strength and liquidity.
Our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) initiatives are led by the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer (“CERO”), who is a member of our leadership team, and who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. The CERO also acts as a liaison between our Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC” - see below) and the XL-Ireland Board
  (or its committees), with respect to risk matters. All of our employees are expected to assist in the appropriate and timely identification and management of risks and to enhance the quality and effectiveness of ERM.
Our ERM framework is designed to allow us to identify and understand material risk concentrations, including concentrations that have unattractive risk/reward dynamics so that prompt, appropriate, corrective or mitigating actions can be taken. To do this, we have risk management committees and processes to serve as
  points of managerial dialogue and convergence across our businesses and functional areas, to create risk aggregation methodologies and to develop specific risk appetites to coordinate the identification, vetting and discussion of risk topics and metrics. As part of our ERM activities, we apply a suite of stress tests, tools, risk
  indicators, metrics and reporting processes that examine the consequences of low probability/high severity events (including those related to emerging risks) in order to take mitigating actions where required.
Risk Governance
Risk governance relates to the processes by which oversight and decision-making authorities with respect to risks are granted to individuals within the enterprise. Our governance framework establishes accountabilities for tasks and outcomes as well as escalation criteria. Governance processes are designed to ensure that
  transactions and activities, individually and in the aggregate, are carried out in accordance with our risk policies, philosophies, appetites, limits and risk concentrations, and in a manner consistent with expectations of excellence of integrity, accountability and client service.
19



The RFC of the XL-Ireland Board oversees ERM matters. With respect to the responsibilities relating to ERM, the RFC:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Oversees ERM activities, including the risk management framework employed by management. In light of the overall risk management framework, the RFC (i) reviews the methodology for establishing our overall risk capacity; (ii) reviews the policies for the establishment of risk limit frameworks, and adherence to such
      limits; and (iii) reviews and approves enterprise risk limits.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Oversees our compliance with any significant enterprise risk limits, authorities and policies. The RFC evaluates what actions to take with respect to such enterprise limits, authorities and policies, and approves any exceptions thereto from time to time as necessary.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Reviews our overall risk profile and monitors key risks across our organization as a whole, which may involve coordination with other committees of the Board from time to time as appropriate.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Reviews our process controls over model use and development with respect to model risk and model effectiveness, accuracy, and propriety.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Monitors our risk management performance and obtains reasonable assurance from management that our risk management policies are effective and are being adhered to.
    
  




The review of our overall risk appetites and the evaluation of the risk impact of any material strategic decision being contemplated, including consideration of whether such strategic decision is within the risk profile established by us, is conducted by the full Board. “Risk appetites,” as referred to above, are broad
  statements used to guide our risk and reward preferences over time, all consistent with, among other factors, business prudence, market opportunities, the underwriting pricing cycle and investment climate. Risk appetites are regularly monitored and can change over time in light of the above. See “Risk Appetite Management”
  below.
Management oversight of ERM is performed, in part, via a centralized management ERC, which is chaired by the CERO. The ERC is comprised of senior management from our businesses and functions and is charged with developing and monitoring enterprise risk policies, risk appetites, risk limits (and compliance with
  such limits) and risk aggregations, and identifying key emerging risks and ways to mitigate such risks.
In addition to the ERC, we have established a framework of separate yet complementary ERM subcommittees, each focusing on particular aspects of ERM. These subcommittees include:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Economic Capital Model Subcommittee: This subcommittee oversees the development of economic capital models that support ERM activities, and helps set priorities and manage resources related to such models. It reviews assumptions and related methodologies used within our economic capital models, including
      assessments of model validation, model control and model risk.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Liability Subcommittee: This subcommittee supports and assists the ERC’s identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting of key underwriting liability and emerging risks.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Asset Risk Subcommittee: This subcommittee assists the ERC in its responsibilities in relation to governance and oversight of asset-related risks across the Company, including the investment portfolio. Among its activities are (a) involvement in policy decisions on modeling and quantification of risk measurements; and
      (b) providing an interpretation and assessment of asset-related risks, with a particular focus on market-related risks. Further, the subcommittee is responsible for coordinating on a regular basis with the Credit Subcommittee of the ERC on asset-related credit risks.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Credit Subcommittee: This subcommittee develops and implements the metrics and supporting framework for allocation of credit risk capacity across major business units and functions, including the amount and types of credit exposure.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Operational Risk Subcommittee: This subcommittee supports the ERC’s identification, measurement, management and oversight of key operational risks through its oversight of key operational risk management processes and through its review of related operational risk indicators, trends and metrics.
    
  




20



In addition to the above, risk management subcommittees within each of our businesses function to ensure that risk is managed in accordance with the risk limits, guidelines and tolerances that we have allocated to them.
Risk Appetite Management
Our risk appetite framework guides our strategies relating to, among other things, capital preservation, earnings volatility, capital at risk, operational loss, liquidity standards, claims paying rating and capital structure. This framework also addresses our tolerance to risks from material individual events (e.g., natural or man-
  made catastrophes such as terrorism), our investment portfolio and realistic disaster scenarios that cross multiple lines of business (and risks related to some or all of the above that may occur concurrently).
In relation to event risk management, we establish net underwriting limits for individual large events as follows:

  
     

  
  
    
      1.
     
     
     
    
      We impose limits for each natural catastrophe peril region at a 1% tail value at risk (“TVaR”) probability. This statistic indicates the average amount of net loss expected to be incurred given that a loss above the 1% exceedance probability level has occurred.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    2.
     
    
     
     
    
    For each event type other than natural catastrophes, we impose limits at a 1% exceedance probability. If we were to deploy the full limit, for any given event type, there would be a 1% probability that an event would occur during the next year that would result in a net underwriting loss in excess of the limit.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    3.
     
    
     
     
    
    We also impose limits for certain other event types at a 0.4% exceedance probability as described in further detail below. If we were to deploy the full limit, for any such given event type, there would be a 0.4% probability that an event would occur during the next year that would result in a net underwriting loss in
      excess of the limit.
    
  




For planning purposes and to calibrate risk tolerances for business to be written from September 30, 2012 through September 30, 2013, we set our underwriting limits as a percent of September 30, 2012 Tangible Shareholders’ Equity (hereafter, “Tangible Shareholders’ Equity”). Tangible Shareholders’ Equity is defined as
  Total Shareholders’ Equity less Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These limits may be recalibrated, from time to time, to reflect material changes in Total Shareholders’ Equity that may occur after September 30, 2012, at the discretion of management and as overseen by the Board.
Tier I event types (“Tier 1 Events”), which include natural catastrophes, terrorism and other realistic disaster scenarios, and Tier 2 event types (“Tier 2 Events”), which include country risk, longevity risk and pandemic risk, are internal risk classifications for the purposes of defining our risk tolerances. In determining Tier
  1 and Tier 2 Events we consider such factors as:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Anticipated risk adjusted returns;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Strategic risk preferences;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Relativity to peers;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Shareholder expectations;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Robustness of exposure assessment methodology; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Projected enterprise loss potential.
    
  




Per event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for North Atlantic Windstorm are set at a level not to exceed approximately 22% of Tangible Shareholders’ Equity. Per event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for North American Earthquake are set at a level not to exceed approximately 20% of Tangible Shareholders’ Equity. Per
  event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for all other natural catastrophe peril regions are set below the per event 1% TVaR limits described above.
Per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limits for terrorism and other realistic disaster scenarios are set at a level not to exceed approximately 15% of Tangible Shareholders’ Equity.
Per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limits for Tier 2 Events are set at a level not to exceed 7.5% of Tangible Shareholders’ Equity.
21



Per event 0.4% exceedance probability underwriting limits for certain Tier 2 Events are set at a level not to exceed 10% of Tangible Shareholders’ Equity. The 0.4% exceedance probability limit is used for Tier 2 Events rather than a TVaR measure due to the difficulty in estimating the full distribution of outcomes in
  the extreme tail of the distribution for these risk types as required for the TVaR measure.
In all instances, the above referenced underwriting limits reflect pre-tax losses net of reinsurance and include inwards and outwards reinstatement premiums related to the specific events being measured. The limits do not contemplate underwriting profits expected to be generated in the absence of catastrophic loss activity.
In setting underwriting limits, we also consider such factors as:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Correlation of underwriting risk with other risks (e.g., asset/investment risk, operational risk, etc.);
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Model risk and robustness of data;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Geographical concentrations;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Exposures at lower return periods;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Expected payback period associated with losses;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Projected share of industry loss; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Annual aggregate losses for natural catastrophes at various return periods including a 1% exceedance probability and a 1% TVaR level on both a peril region basis and a portfolio basis.
    
  




Loss exposure estimates for all event risks are derived from a combination of commercially available and internally developed models together with the judgment of management, as overseen by the XL-Ireland Board. Actual incurred losses may vary materially from our estimates. Factors that can cause a deviation
  between estimated and actualized loss potential include:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Inaccurate assumption of event frequency and severity;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Inaccurate or incomplete data;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Changing climate conditions that may add to the unpredictability of frequency and severity of natural catastrophes in certain parts of the world and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Future possible increases in property values and the effects of inflation that may increase the severity of catastrophic events to levels above the modeled levels;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Natural catastrophe models that incorporate and are critically dependent on meteorological, seismological and other earth science assumptions and related statistical relationships that may not be representative of prevailing conditions and risks, and may therefore misstate how particular events actually materialize, causing
      a material deviation between forecasted and actual damages associated with such events; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    A change in the judicial climate.
    
  




For the above and other reasons, the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes and other event types are inherently unpredictable and it is difficult to estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. As a consequence, there is material uncertainty around our ability to measure exposures associated with
  individual events and combinations of events. This uncertainty could cause actual exposures and losses to deviate from those amounts estimated, which in turn can create a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may result in substantial liquidation of investments, possibly at a loss, and
  outflows of cash as losses are paid. For this reason, we carry capital in addition to that required by the specific limits described even if it is in excess of rating agency and regulatory required capital.
For a further discussion on risk appetite management see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Key Focuses of Management.”

Impact of ERM Processes
We believe that our ERM processes improve the quality and timeliness of strategic decisions, enhance the integration of strategic initiatives with the risks related to such initiatives and act as catalysts to improve risk awareness and informed action by us. We believe that the integration of ERM with existing business
  processes and controls optimizes the risk/reward characteristics of business strategies, enhances our overall risk management culture, and is central to our capital allocation process.
In addition, our ERM processes complement our overall internal control framework by helping to manage the complexity that is inherent within an organization of our size and with the variety of our businesses, investment activities and geographical reach. However, internal controls and ERM can provide only reasonable,
  not absolute, assurance that control objectives will be met. As a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of our ERM activities. An investor should carefully consider the risks and all information set forth in this report including the discussion included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Item 7A, “Quantitative
  and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Regulation
Our operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and licensed to conduct business. Generally, regulatory authorities can have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, fitness of management, standards of solvency,
  material transactions between affiliates, premium rates, policy forms, investments, security deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, claims handling, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements and/or risk based capital
  standards, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings or notifications. See Item 8, Note 23, “Statutory Financial Data,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than
  shareholders. We cannot predict the potential effect that any new regulations would have on our operating subsidiaries or on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See “Risk Factors – The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse
  effect on our business.” A summary of certain regulatory requirements in the key jurisdictions in which we operate follows.
In addition, XL-Ireland, our ultimate holding company, is domiciled in Ireland. Although XL-Ireland is not an Irish regulated operating entity, the Central Bank of Ireland, or CBI, has informed us that it will be our group supervisor under Solvency II. Adopted by the European Parliament in April 2009, Solvency II is an
  E.U. directive covering the capital adequacy and risk management of, and regulatory reporting for, European-based (re)insurers. Several steps must be taken by the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”) to
  implement Solvency II. The final date of implementation and key elements of the framework remain under discussion, but it is widely accepted that the envisaged implementation date of January 1, 2014 will not be met. In October 2012, the European Parliament rescheduled the plenary vote of the Omnibus II Directive from
  November 2012 to March 2013. The Omnibus II directive sets the date of entry into force of the Solvency II regime and amends the Solvency II framework directive on capital requirements for insurance companies. Following adoption, there are multiple rounds of consultation and publication prior to implementation.
As an Irish public company, XL-Ireland is subject to reporting requirements and certain restrictions under Irish company law. See “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition—Holding Company Liquidity” and Item 8, Note 23, “Statutory Financial Data,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
  herein.
Ireland
Our Irish regulated operating subsidiary, XL Re Europe public limited company, is subject to the regulatory framework established by the CBI. It is required to, among other matters:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      maintain an adequate solvency margin and guarantee fund;
    
  


23






  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    submit quarterly and annual regulatory returns as well as ad hoc reporting of certain material transactions; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    obtain regulatory pre-approval of certain transactions, such as payment of dividends or acquisitions and disposals in the ownership/voting rights of (re)insurance companies.
    
  



The CBI has minimum competency and fitness and probity codes that seek to ensure that regulated entities are run by those with appropriate professional qualifications or experience within the CBI’s view, with regulatory pre-approval required for certain key roles. The CBI’s code of corporate governance includes
  prescriptive rules regarding board role and composition, establishment and operation of board sub-committees and requirements around the approval of risk appetites and the monitoring and reporting of risks. In addition, the CBI has broad supervisory and administrative powers over capital and surplus requirements and the
  declaration of and payment of dividends or other distributions. Our Irish operating subsidiary is required to seek prior approval from the CBI to reduce its share capital or to pay dividends.
United Kingdom
Our U.K. regulated operating subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”). The FSA’s Handbook of Rules and Guidance (the “FSA Rules”) covers all aspects of regulation including capital adequacy, financial and non-financial reporting, the payment of dividends and certain other activities of
  U.K. regulated firms. Our Lloyd’s managing agency, its managed syndicates and its associated corporate capital vehicles are subject to additional Lloyd’s requirements. The FSA’s Approved Persons regime also subjects certain of our employees and directors to FSA regulation regarding their “fitness.”
In 2010, the U.K. government released plans to abolish the FSA and separate its responsibilities between a number of new agencies and the Bank of England. This is expected to occur in the Spring of 2013. In 2013, the FSA will be replaced by two new regulatory bodies: the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”)
  and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Both the PRA and FCA will have regulatory oversight of our U.K. regulated operating subsidiaries.
Other European Union
Our network of offices in the European Union consists mainly of branches of Irish and U.K. companies and these offices are principally regulated under European directives from their home states of Ireland and the U.K., respectively, rather than by each individual jurisdiction.
Bermuda Operations
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related rules and regulations, as amended (the “Bermuda Act”), regulates our Bermuda (re)insurance operating subsidiaries, which must be registered as (re)insurers by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”). The Bermuda Act imposes on Bermuda (re)insurance companies,
  solvency and liquidity standards, certain restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and distributions, certain restrictions on the reduction of statutory capital, auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the BMA powers to supervise and, in certain circumstances, to investigate and intervene in the affairs of
  (re)insurance companies.
Certain of our Bermuda regulated (re)insurance companies are required to prepare and file annual audited GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards financial statements, as well as annual statutory financial returns, annual capital and solvency returns and quarterly financial returns.
Our Bermuda regulated general business (re)insurers are required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of their enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”). The applicable ECR is established by reference to either the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”), which employs
  a standard mathematical model that can relate more accurately the risks taken on by (re) insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business, or a BMA-approved internal capital model. The BMA has also established a target capital level (“TCL”) for each (re)insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. While (re)insurers are not
  required to maintain their statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL acts as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to TCL will likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight. Our Bermuda regulated (re)insurers use the BSCR model to calculate their solvency
  requirements.
24



Under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended, a Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the
  realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under the Bermuda Act, a Class 4 (re)insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus unless it certifies to the BMA that it will continue to meet its minimum solvency
  margin and minimum liquidity ratio.
In addition, neither Class 4 (re)insurers nor certain long-term (re)insurers may reduce their total statutory capital by 15% or more unless they have received the prior approval from the BMA.
United States
In the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The state legislatures and/or state (re)insurance regulators consider or enact laws or regulations that may alter or increase the regulation of (re)insurance companies and (re)insurance holding companies. State
  laws and regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations and may affect our operations, financial condition through lower revenue and/or higher costs of compliance and could adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth. For example, regulators may choose
  to restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies, reject rate increases or increase the statutory capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries.
There are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect our insurance operating subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has recently adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that would provide for supervision of
  insurers at the corporate group level. Although such changes are only beginning to be considered or adopted by individual state regulators, it can be expected that most state regulators will ultimately adopt them in some form. The various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate
  governance, group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies, adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies.
Additionally, the NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (“SMI”), which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory system and will lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its
  focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.
Currently, our U.S. regulated operating subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and, in most states, quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they are licensed or accredited. In addition, these subsidiaries’ operations and accounts are subject to financial condition and market
  conduct examination at regular intervals by state regulators. In June of 2012, all three states in which the U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled (New York, Delaware and North Dakota) issued reports on their examination of the financial condition of each of the subsidiaries for the five year period ended
  December 31, 2010. The reports concluded that all findings from the prior examination had been effectively addressed, and no new findings were reported.
Our U.S. regulated operating subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from earned surplus without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on a calculation of the lesser of
  10% of statutory surplus or 100% of “adjusted net investment income” to the extent that it has not previously been distributed.
While the U.S. federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business in the U.S. (other than for flood, nuclear and reinsurance of losses from terrorism), federal legislation and administrative policies can affect the insurance industry. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
  Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was passed into law. Dodd-Frank requires the creation of a Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department that will be focused on national coordination of the insurance sector, systemic risk mitigation and international regulatory cooperation. Although the Federal 
25



Insurance Office currently does not directly regulate the insurance industry, under Dodd-Frank it has the power to preempt state insurance regulations that are inconsistent with international agreements regarding insurance regulation, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Dodd-Frank provides that the Federal Insurance
  Office must submit a report to Congress on improving U.S. insurance regulation, which must cover the feasibility of future federal regulation of the U.S. insurance industry.
Other International Operations
We have a number of regulated operating subsidiaries outside of the European Union, Bermuda and the United States. The degree of regulation in foreign jurisdictions can vary and licenses issued by foreign authorities are subject to modification or revocation for cause by such authorities. Our subsidiaries could be
  prevented, for cause, from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the
  type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.
In addition to these requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and limitations on the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating
  policies. A summary of certain regulatory requirements in Switzerland, Latin America and China follows.
Switzerland
Supervision of our Swiss regulated operating subsidiaries is carried out by the Federal Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”). The supervisory regime currently comprises both Solvency I requirements and Solvency II type requirements (“Swiss Solvency Test”), the latter of which impose higher capital
  requirements. Furthermore, direct insurers and insurance branches operating in Switzerland have to comply with “tied assets” requirements. Reinsurance branches of foreign legal entities are exempt from supervision by FINMA and are supervised by the country in which they are domiciled.
The Swiss supervisory regime was considered in EIOPA’s first wave of third country equivalence assessment for Solvency II. EIOPA advised that Switzerland meets the criteria set out in EIOPA’s methodology for equivalence assessments for Article 172 (equivalence for reinsurance supervision) and Article 260
  (equivalence for third country group supervision), with certain caveats. For Article 227 (Calculating group solvability), the Swiss regulatory regime was assessed as equivalent, with no caveats.
In September 2012, FINMA and EIOPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) regarding cooperation in supervision, in particular for insurance groups with international activities in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. The MoU creates a formal basis for cooperation in the following areas: group
  supervision, assistance in the work of EEA and FINMA colleges of supervisors, action required in emergency situations, safeguarding financial stability by monitoring and assessing risks, interconnectedness and conducting stress tests. This MoU will not modify or supersede any laws or regulatory requirements in force and will
  not affect any arrangements under the MoU that have previously been signed between FINMA and other national supervisory authorities of the EEA.
Latin America 
We have both insurance and reinsurance operations in the Latin America region, with local companies in Brazil and Mexico and representative offices in Argentina and Colombia. Other than the Colombia representative office, all the legal entities in the region are subsidiaries, and there are no branches. Where we do not
  have a legal entity, we act as a foreign reinsurer. Nearly all regulators in the Latin America region require foreign reinsurers to be registered or licensed to accept reinsurance business.
The extent of regulation in the region varies significantly in the countries in which we conduct business. Typically, each country has regulations relating to solvency, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting, but the type and extent of the requirements differs substantially. Other regulations in the region that
  impact our operations but are not specific to insurance or reinsurance include those relating to 
26



foreign currency exchange control, data protection legislation, anti-money laundering legislation and sanctions.
China
Our Chinese regulated operating subsidiary is regulated by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (the “CIRC”) under the People’s Republic of China Insurance Law. CIRC’s regulatory regime includes requirements relating to licensing, capital, premium and liability, disclosure and periodic reporting and approval or
  filing of policy wordings and rates.
Employees
At December 31, 2012, we had 4,007 employees. At that date, 232 of our employees were represented by workers’ councils and 418 of our employees were subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements in several countries outside the United States.

      ITEM 1A.
     
    
      RISK FACTORS
  
  
     
     
     
  


Any of the following risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity, in addition to the other information contained in this report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
  business, financial condition and results of operations.
The occurrence of disasters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and prospects.
We have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural and man-made disasters and other catastrophic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, explosions, severe weather, fires, war and acts of terrorism. Changing climate conditions may add to the
  unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss
  any given occurrence will generate.
The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal quarter or year in which a catastrophic event occurs, as well as subsequent fiscal periods, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
  condition and results of operations and our ability to write new business. This risk is exacerbated due to accounting principles and rules that do not permit (re)insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur. We expect that future possible increases in the values and concentrations of insured property, the
  effects of inflation and changes in cyclical weather patterns may increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to catastrophic events, a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones and lines of business and the frequency or severity of catastrophic
  events could exceed our estimates, in each case potentially having a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while we may, depending on market conditions, purchase catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessional protection, the occurrence of one or more major
  catastrophes in any given period could result in losses that exceed such reinsurance and retrocessional protection. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may result in substantial liquidation of investments, possibly at a loss, and outflows of cash as losses are paid.
The failure of any of the underwriting risk management strategies that we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.
We seek to limit our loss exposure by, among other things, writing a number of our reinsurance or retrocession contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client and prudently underwriting each program
  written. In addition, in the case of proportional treaties, we generally seek to use per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event. We cannot be sure that all of these loss limitation methods will have the precise risk management impact intended. For instance, although we also seek
  to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification, geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone’s limits. Underwriting involves the exercise of considerable judgment and the
  making of important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. The failure of any of the underwriting risk management strategies that we employ could have a material adverse effect on
  our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, we cannot provide assurance that various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, will be enforceable in the manner that we intend and disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may arise,
  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
28



The insurance and reinsurance industries are historically cyclical and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.
The insurance and reinsurance industries have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often followed by an increasing supply of
  insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Either of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and conditions and fewer
  submissions for our underwriting services. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance industries significantly.
A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
As our ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies, a downgrade by any of these institutions could cause our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry to suffer and make it more difficult
  for us to market our products.
A downgrade below “A-” of our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), which is two notches below the current S&P and A.M. Best financial strength ratings of “A” (Positive) and “A” (Stable), respectively, for our principal insurance and
  reinsurance subsidiaries, may trigger termination provisions in a significant amount of our assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require us to return unearned premium to cedants. Whether a client would exercise its termination rights after such a downgrade would likely depend on, among other things, the
  reasons for the downgrade, the extent of the downgrade, prevailing market conditions, the degree of unexpired coverage, and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. Based on premium value, approximately 70% of our in force reinsurance contracts at January 1, 2013 contained provisions allowing
  clients to terminate those contracts upon a decline in our ratings to below “A-.” In the event of such a downgrade, we cannot predict whether or how many of our clients would actually exercise such termination rights or the extent to which any such terminations would have a material adverse effect on our financial
  condition, results of operations, cash flows or future prospects or the market price for our securities. A downgrade could also result in both a substantial loss of business for us as ceding companies and brokers that place such business may move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher ratings and the loss of key
  employees. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility agreements, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain “in use” portions of these facilities (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
  of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Part II, Item 7 of this report). Specifically, a downgrade below “A-” by A.M. Best would constitute an event of default under the Company’s three largest credit facilities and may trigger such collateral requirements. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may
  require us to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and/or other transactions with the respective counterparties.
In addition to the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, various rating agencies also publish credit ratings for XL-Cayman. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner, are part of our overall funding profile and
  affect our ability to access certain types of liquidity. Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital markets, potentially increasing the cost of debt or requiring us to
  post collateral.
Downgrading of the United States’ credit rating could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States from “AAA” to “AA+” in August 2011. In addition, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s 
29



Investor Services maintain a negative outlook on U.S. debt, and both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Services have warned that they may downgrade the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating if future budget negotiations to raise the debt ceiling fail, or if steps are not taken to decrease the U.S.’s debt load. Because
  of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the impact of a further downgrade to the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating or any other further rating actions by any rating agency is inherently unpredictable. Such actions could have material adverse impacts on
  financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including with respect to assets in our investment portfolio, as well as assets in trusts or other collateral arrangements posted
  by or to us. In addition, further downgrades of the United States’ credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, and could negatively impact the average credit rating quality of our investment portfolio, which could require us to change our minimum average credit quality target.
The sovereign debt crisis in Europe and concerns regarding the instability of Euro-zone countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the uncertainty relating to the level of sovereign debt of numerous E.U. member states, the ability of those countries to service their sovereign debt obligations and the stability of financial institutions operating within those E.U. member states.
  This uncertainty has and could in the future result in volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of E.U. member states and on other European-related corporate debt held within our investment portfolio and could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the E.U. and throughout the world.
  In addition, continuing downgrades of sovereign debt could bring down the average credit rating quality of our investment portfolio.
The interdependencies among European economies and financial institutions and between such European economies and financial institutions and those of the rest of the world have also exacerbated concern regarding the stability of European financial markets generally and certain institutions in particular. One or more
  Euro-zone countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Monetary Union or the European Union, or the Euro as the single currency of the Euro-zone could cease to exist if the European Monetary Union were dissolved. These or other actions could ultimately result in the European Union ceasing to
  exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could lead to severe economic recession or depression. If one or more countries abandon the Euro or the European Monetary Union dissolves, it may result in uncertainty with respect to the terms, value or enforceability of
  these bonds, instruments or contracts, which could result in a material loss to us. Similarly, if a country leaving the Euro-zone imposes currency controls, such controls may have a material adverse impact on the value of and our ability to withdraw funds from that country.
Given the extent of our European operations, including that XL-Ireland is domiciled in Ireland, and our European investment holdings, clients and counterparties, persistent volatility in the European financial markets, or the failure of any significant European financial institution arising from the wider implications of the
  crisis, even if not an immediate counterparty to us, could have a material adverse impact on our business, investment portfolio, liquidity or financial performance. If the current Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis persists or worsens, it could lead to further political uncertainty, material changes to tax policies of Euro-zone
  countries, financial turmoil and social unrest, affecting the successful implementation of stability measures. Sovereigns, financial institutions and companies may become subject to liquidity shortages and be unable to obtain refinancing or new funding, leading to an increased risk of a default on their existing debt, and
  measures to reduce debt levels and fiscal deficits could result in a further slowdown of or negative economic growth.
For a discussion of the risks to our business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to our investment portfolio, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates as well as other
  investment risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.” For a discussion of risks associated with the United States’ credit rating, see the risk factor entitled “Downgrading of the United States’ credit rating could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
  and results of operations.”

Our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.
A number of our recent and planned business initiatives involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. This includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or profitably grow market share:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      We may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured or contain new coverage or coverage terms.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    We may refine our underwriting processes.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    We may seek to expand distribution channels.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    We may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the United States where we have had relatively little or no market share or operating history.
    
  



We may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. Among other risks:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      Demand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    To the extent we are able to market new products or expand into new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. This, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our
      expectations.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    Efforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    In connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders’ pricing may increase, while the pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and margins.
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    To develop new products or markets, we may encounter unanticipated operational issues or we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also negatively impact results.
    
  



If our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results could be materially and adversely affected.
We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates as well as other investment risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Our operating results are affected by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our assets are invested by a number of investment management service providers under the direction of the Company’s management within the Investment Group in accordance, in general, with detailed investment guidelines set by us under
  the oversight of the RFC, and established in accordance with our SAA framework for our P&C and Life operations investment portfolios. Although our investment policies stress diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market-wide risks, as noted below, and fluctuations,
  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. We are exposed to significant capital markets risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and defaults, market liquidity, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. If significant continued market volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads
  and defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, a reduction in market liquidity, declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar occur, individually or together, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash
  flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions. Levels of write-down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of the intent to sell securities that have declined in value as well as actual losses as a result of defaults or deterioration in estimates of cash flows. We periodically review our
  investment portfolio structure and strategy. If, as a result of such review, we determine to reposition or realign portions of the investment portfolio and sell securities in an unrealized loss position, we will incur an other than temporary impairment charge. Any such charge may have a material adverse effect on our results of
  operations and business.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of the prolonged and continued volatility and disruptions in the public debt and equity markets, we incurred realized and unrealized investment losses, as described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part
  II, Item 7 of this report. We continue to closely monitor current market conditions and evaluate the long term impact of this market volatility on all of our investment holdings. Depending on market conditions, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse
  effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and business.
Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability of fixed income instruments that are associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which have been and may continue to be
  adversely affected by changes in interest rates from central bank monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, offset by our ability to earn higher rates of
  return on funds reinvested over time. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested. We maintain a P&C investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is determined
  in accordance with its SAA Benchmark based on a dynamic financial analysis of investment assets and liabilities, and that is intended to maximize the Company’s enterprise value subject to accounting, regulatory, capital and risk tolerances. The SAA Benchmarks and portfolios supporting our Life operations are rebalanced
  regularly to reflect an explicit asset-liability management process. However, for both the P&C and Life operations investment portfolios our estimates of the time and size of our estimated loss payment profile may be inaccurate and despite stochastic investment portfolio modeling, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior
  to maturity at a loss in order to cover liabilities. In sum, we are economically exposed to interest rate risk on our capital and to the extent that our investment portfolio maturities are a poor hedge of actual liability loss payments.
Our exposure to credit spread risk relates primarily to the market price associated with changes in prevailing market credit spreads and the impact on our holdings of spread products such as corporate and structured and credit-sensitive government-related securities. Approximately 2.8% of our aggregate fixed income
  portfolio consists of below investment-grade high yield fixed income securities. These securities have a higher degree of credit or default risk and a greater exposure to credit spread risk. Certain sectors within the investment and below investment grade fixed income market, such as structured and corporate credit, may be less
  liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. While we have put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets in general and those impacted by recent credit market issues specifically, it is possible that, in periods of economic weakness or periods of turmoil in capital
  markets, we may experience default losses in both our investment grade and below investment grade corporate and structured holdings. This may result in a material reduction of net income, capital and cash flows.
We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in common stock or equity-related securities, including alternative funds, private equity funds and other funds. The value of these assets fluctuates, due to changes in the equity and credit markets along with other factors. In times of economic weakness, the market value and
  liquidity of these assets may decline, and may impact net income, capital and cash flows. In addition, certain of the products offered by our Life operations offer fixed guaranteed returns while debt and equity yields may continue to decline. In addition, the amount of earnings from alternative funds, private investment funds
  and other funds are not earned evenly across the year, or even from year to year. As a result, the amount of earnings that we record from these investments may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. The timing of distributions from such private investment funds depends on particular events relating to the underlying
  investments. The ability of an alternative fund to satisfy any redemption request from its investors depends on the underlying liquidity of the alternative fund’s investments. As a result, earnings, distributions and redemptions from these two asset classes may be more difficult to predict, and, if such funds are unable to satisfy
  our redemption requests, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. As alternative and private investment funds are collective investment vehicles managed by third parties, we do not control the proceeds once we make our investments, thus subjecting us to a higher level of fraud
  risk than is the case with our fixed income and equity holdings.
32



The functional currencies of our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries include the U.S. dollar, U.K. sterling, the Euro, the Swiss franc and the Canadian dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations relative to the functional currencies may materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Many
  of our non-U.S. subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in currencies different than their functional currency, which exposes us to changes in currency exchange rates.
In addition, locally-required capital levels are invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. Foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process and we utilize derivative instruments such as
  futures, options and foreign currency forward contracts to, among other things, manage our foreign currency exposure. It is possible that these instruments will not effectively mitigate all or a substantial portion of our foreign exchange rate risk, which could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.
Certain of our investments may be illiquid or are in asset classes that have in times of market stress experienced significant market valuation fluctuations.
We hold certain investments that may lack liquidity or for which the availability of prices or inputs may be reduced in periods of market dislocation, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed and collateralized debt obligations securities. Even some of our high quality assets have been more illiquid during periods
  of challenging market conditions. Generally, securities classified as Level 3 pursuant to the fair value hierarchy set forth in authoritative accounting guidance over fair value measurements may be less liquid, may be more difficult to value, requiring significant judgment, and may be more likely to result in sales at materially
  different amounts than the fair values determined by management.
If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with certain of our reinsurance contracts, credit agreements, derivative transactions or our invested portfolio, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely
  manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both.
The reported values of our relatively illiquid types of investments and, in certain circumstances, our high quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market bid price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the market, there can be no assurance that we will be
  able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices, particularly at times of extreme market illiquidity. Any such sales could adversely impact the Company’s financial position.
If actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated levels of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) liabilities, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported
  claims for losses and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred. The process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability, as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. Actuarial estimates of unpaid loss and LAE
  liabilities are subject to potential errors of estimation, which could be significant, due to the fact that the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the date of such estimation, whether reported or not, is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred. Examples of these events include the accuracy of the
  factual information on which the estimates were based, especially as estimates develop, jury decisions, court interpretations, legislative changes, changes in the medical condition of claimants, public attitudes, and economic conditions such as inflation.
Recent deficit spending by governments in the Company’s major markets exposes the Company to heightened risk of inflation. Inflation in relation to medical costs, construction costs and tort issues in particular impact the property and casualty industry. However, broader market inflation also poses a risk of increasing
  overall loss costs. The impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered “long tail” such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. Changes in the level of inflation also result in an increased
  level of uncertainty in our estimation of loss reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business. The estimation of loss reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse economic 
33



conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims.
Similarly, the actual emergence of claims for life business may vary from the assumptions underlying the policy benefit reserves, in particular, the future assumed mortality improvements on the blocks of in-payment annuities.
We have an actuarial staff in each of our operating segments and a Chief Actuary who regularly evaluates the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. Any such evaluation could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverable and
  would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and LAE, to the extent that they exceed the applicable reserves, are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for unpaid losses and LAE represents the estimated ultimate losses and LAE less paid losses and LAE, and
  comprises case reserves and IBNR. During the loss settlement period, which can span many years in duration for casualty business, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known and case reserves may be adjusted by allocation from IBNR without any change in the overall reserve. In
  addition, application of statistical and actuarial methods may require the adjustment of the overall reserves upward or downward from time to time. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses may be significantly greater than or less than reported loss and loss expense reserves.
The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.
As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, political and other environmental conditions change, unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims,
  such as the effects that disruptions in the credit markets could have on the number and size of reported claims under directors and officers liability insurance (“D&O”) and professional liability insurance lines of business. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the
  insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. Historically such claims and coverage issues have occurred at heightened levels during periods of very soft market conditions which often reflect an inflection point in the typical cycle of insurance industry market conditions. In addition, our actual losses may
  vary materially from our current estimate of the loss based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages that had not previously been considered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. As a
  result, the full extent of liability under an insurance or reinsurance contract may not be known for many years after such contract is issued and a loss occurs.
There can be no assurance as to the effect that governmental and regulatory actions will have on the marketplace generally or on us in particular.
In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to financial institutions, there have been numerous regulatory and governmental actions in the United States, the U.K. and the Euro-zone, among other countries. The purpose of these legislative and regulatory
  actions is to stabilize the U.S. and international financial markets, improve the flow of credit, increase employment levels and foster an economic recovery.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has issued rules establishing the process and criteria by which companies may be designated as nonbank systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”) subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FSOC.
  Similarly, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions (“G-
  SIFIs”), should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address issues such as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. In addition, the FSB has
  directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) to create standards relative to these areas for global systemically important insurers (“G-SIIs”) and incorporate them within that body’s Insurance Core Principles. While we do not expect that we will be designated as a SIFI, 
34



G-SIFI or G-SII, certain of our competitors may be so designated, which may impact market behavior and/or access to capital.
With respect to our investment portfolio, we own a number of Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 hybrid securities issued by financial institutions including those based in the U.S., Europe and the U.K. There is a risk that, if the capital positions of financial institutions deteriorate further government intervention, particularly
  nationalization of such institutions, could occur. There is also a risk of regulatory imposed deferral of coupons or decisions by bank management not to call the capital or defer the coupon payments. This may result in losses on the hybrid securities we hold. There is also the risk of further downgrades of these or other
  securities as rating agencies re-evaluate their rating methodologies, which would negatively impact the regulatory capital of the Life operations or the valuation of our investment portfolio assets generally.
In particular, the current sovereign debt crisis concerning European countries, including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, or GIIPS, and related European financial restructuring efforts, may cause the value of the European currencies, including the Euro, to further deteriorate, which in turn could adversely impact
  Euro-denominated assets held in our investment portfolio or our European book of business. In addition, the European crisis is contributing to instability in global credit markets, as well as the widening of bond yield spreads. Rating agency downgrades on European sovereign debt and continuing concern about the potential
  default of government issuers or a possible break-up of the European Union has further contributed to this uncertainty. Should governments default on their obligations, there will be a negative impact on both our direct holdings, as well as on non-government issues and financials held within the country of default. See Item 7,
  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Balance Sheet Analysis–European Sovereign Debt Crisis” for an analysis of our fixed maturity portfolio’s exposure to GIIPS.
There can be no assurance as to the effect that any such governmental actions or future regulatory initiatives may have on certain investment instruments in our investment portfolio, or on our competitive position, business or financial position. If global economic and market conditions remain uncertain and volatile, or
  deteriorate further, we may experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We may be unable to purchase reinsurance and, even if we are able to successfully purchase reinsurance, we are subject to the possibility of being unable to collect reinsurance when due.
We purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the volatility that losses impose on our financial condition. Our clients purchase reinsurance from us to cover part of the risk originally written by them. Retrocessional reinsurance involves a reinsurer ceding to another reinsurer, the retrocessionaire, all or
  part of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has assumed. Reinsurance, including retrocessional reinsurance, does not legally discharge the ceding company from its liability with respect to its obligations to its insureds or reinsureds. A reinsurer’s or retrocessionaire’s insolvency, inability or refusal to make timely payments
  under the terms of its agreements with us, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to our insureds and reinsureds. For further information regarding our reinsurance exposure, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
From time to time, market conditions may limit or prevent us from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that we consider adequate for our business needs such that we may not be able to obtain reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness in amounts that we deem
  desirable or on terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable.
The impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to counterparties in various industries, including banks, hedge funds and other investment vehicles, and in reinsurance and other transactions, including derivative transactions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event our counterparty fails to perform its obligations. Even if we are
  entitled to collateral when a counterparty defaults, such collateral may be illiquid or proceeds from such collateral when liquidated may not be sufficient to recover the full amount of the obligation. We also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of secured and unsecured debt instruments and equity securities. See
  Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
35



Since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.
We market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. AON Corporation, Marsh & McLennan Companies and the Willis Group and their respective subsidiaries each provided significant portions of our gross written premiums for property and casualty operations.
  Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our reliance on brokers subjects us to credit risk.
In certain jurisdictions, when an insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for policies of insurance or contracts of reinsurance to brokers for further payment to us, such premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for such amounts, whether or not we
  have actually received the premiums from the broker. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased reinsurance from us. Although the law is unsettled
  and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a claims payment to the insured or ceding insurer, we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for that non-payment. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers
  with whom we transact business. Due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law governing these types of scenarios and our lack of historical experience with such risks, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk.
We are subject to a number of risks associated with our business in emerging markets.
Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business outside the United States, primarily in the U.K., Bermuda, and Europe. We have also continued to pursue opportunities in other countries, including in emerging markets such as Asia, Africa and Latin America. In conducting such business we are subject to a
  number of significant risks. These risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, ownership limits and other restrictive governmental actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. In addition, some countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and
  regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of the local laws. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation
  generally.
Our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends, make payments on our debt securities and make other payments.
Our ability to pay dividends or return capital from shareholders’ equity is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which our principal operating subsidiaries operate, certain additional required regulatory approvals and financial covenants contained in our letters of credit and revolving credit
  facilities.
As holding companies, XL-Ireland and XL-Cayman have no operations of their own and their assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Accordingly, XL-Ireland and XL-Cayman rely on the availability of dividends and other permissible payments from subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on
  debt, to pay operating expenses and ordinary and preferred shareholder dividends, to make capital investments in subsidiaries and to pay other obligations that may arise from time to time. The payment of dividends to us by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is regulated under the laws of the various countries and
  states, including Bermuda, the U.K., Ireland, Switzerland and in the other jurisdictions where we have regulated subsidiaries, by certain insurance statutes of various states in the United States in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business and by the Society of Lloyd’s. For further
  information regarding regulatory restrictions governing the payment of dividends by the Company’s significant property and casualty subsidiaries in Ireland, Bermuda and the U.S., see Item 8, Note 23, “Statutory Financial Data,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 1, “Business – Regulation.”
XL-Ireland is subject to certain legal constraints that affect its ability to pay dividends on or redeem or buyback our ordinary shares. While XL-Ireland’s articles of association authorize its board of directors to 
36



declare and pay dividends as justified from the profits, under Irish law, XL-Ireland may only pay dividends or buyback or redeem shares using distributable reserves. On July 23, 2010, the Irish High Court approved XL-Ireland’s conversion of share premium to $5.0 billion of distributable reserves, subject to the completion of
  certain formalities under Irish Company law. These formalities were completed in early August 2010. As of December 31, 2012, XL-Ireland had $3.6 billion in distributable reserves. In addition, no dividend or distribution may be made unless the net assets of XL-Ireland are not less than the aggregate of its share capital plus
  undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce XL-Ireland’s net assets below such aggregate.
In addition, XL-Cayman is subject to certain constraints that affect its ability to pay dividends on its preferred shares. Under Cayman Islands law, XL-Cayman may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that XL-Cayman is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as
  they become due in the ordinary course of business. Also, the terms of XL-Cayman’s preferred shares prohibit declaring or paying dividends on the ordinary shares unless full dividends have been declared and paid on the outstanding preferred shares.
The ability to declare and pay dividends may also be restricted by financial covenants in our letters of credit and revolving credit facilities. We were in compliance with all covenants by significant margins at December 31, 2012, and currently remain in compliance.
We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, on a timely basis or at all.
Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover our losses. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and
  cover claim payments, or that our capital position is adversely impacted by mark-to-market changes on the investment portfolio, catastrophe events or otherwise, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. As a result of the current severe economic conditions that
  persist in the capital markets, any future financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our letter of credit facilities are needed to a significant extent for U.S. cedants, and are effective for such cedants only if the banks issuing letters of credit are on the list of National Association of Insurance
  Commissioners (“NAIC”) approved banks. If some or all of the issuing banks under our credit facilities cease to be NAIC approved, whether arising from macroeconomic or bank specific events, and we are unable to replace non-approved banks with NAIC approved banks, our letter of credit facility capacity could be
  significantly diminished. In addition, in the case of a macroeconomic event, such as dissolution of the European Monetary Union, the availability of alternative lending sources may be significantly reduced or non-existent, and the cost of replacement facilities may be significantly increased or prohibitive. Any future equity
  financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders or could result in the issuance of securities that have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities. Our inability to obtain adequate capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
  operations.
Competition in the insurance and reinsurance industries could reduce our operating margins.
The insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S., Bermudian, European and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial and management resources and higher ratings
  than we have. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets and with alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products, such as insurance/risk-linked securities, catastrophe bonds and derivatives. In recent years capital market
  participants have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks. Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce our margins.
Operational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.
Losses can result from operational risk such as, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures, failure to appropriately transition new hires or external events. Areas of
  operational risk can be heightened in discontinued or exited businesses as a result of 
37



reduced overall resource allocation and the loss of relevant knowledge and expertise by departing management.
We operate globally, and have two office locations in India that currently provide large portions of our back office support. Our global operations present significant operational risk due to the possibility of disruptions in communication or information processes, whether due to technical difficulties, power failures or
  destruction or damage to our offices for any reason. If any disruption occurs, our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if natural or man-made catastrophic events occur, and such disruption could harm our results of operations or our reputation in the marketplace.
We believe that our modeling, underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business, as our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Moreover, our information technology and
  application systems have been important to our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. Our business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our ability to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide
  effective and efficient service to our clients, and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems and processes supporting them. Failure of any of these systems or inaccuracies in the data stored therein may jeopardize our ability to service
  and interact with clients, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, we have licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we will have access to these, or comparable, service providers, or that our information technology or application systems will continue to
  operate as intended. We also have outsourced the day-to-day management, custody and record-keeping of our investment portfolio to third-party managers and custodians that we believe to be reputable. A major defect in those investment managers’ investment management strategy, or decision-making could result in
  management distraction and/or significant financial loss. We also rely on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues. A major defect in our brokers’, investment managers’ or custodians’ internal controls or information and technology systems could result in management distraction or significant financial loss.
Any ineffectiveness in our internal controls, information technology, application systems, investment management or custody and record keeping could have a material adverse effect on our business.
System security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our internal control and information technology and application systems may be vulnerable to threats from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network’s system security measures
  and misappropriate or compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition to our own confidential information, as a (re)insurer, we receive and are required to protect confidential information from clients and other third parties. To the extent any disruption or security breach results
  in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or that of others, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and clients, lead to claims against us, result in regulatory action and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our
  business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to mitigate the damage caused by any security breach, or to protect against future damage.
Unanticipated losses from terrorism and uncertainty surrounding the future of the TRIPRA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”), as amended, established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (“TRIP”), which became effective on November 26, 2002 and was a three-year federal program effective through 2005. On December 22, 2005, President George W. Bush signed a bill extending
  TRIA (“TRIAE”) for two more years, continuing TRIP through 2007. On December 26, 2007, President George W. Bush signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”) which further extended TRIP for seven years until December 31, 2014 and also eliminated the distinction between
  foreign and domestic acts of terrorism.
In response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from, among other things, the September 11 event, the TRIP was created upon the enactment of the TRIA of 
38



2002 to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the U.S. This law established a federal program, that has now been extended to December 31, 2014, to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism-related losses and required
  that coverage for terrorist acts be offered by insurers.
TRIA voided in force terrorism exclusions as of November 26, 2002 for certified terrorism on all TRIA specified property and casualty business. TRIA required covered insurers to make coverage available for certified acts of terrorism on all new and renewal policies issued after TRIA was enacted. TRIA along with
  further extensions to TRIP, as noted above, allows us to assess a premium charge for terrorism coverage and, if the policyholder declines the coverage or fails to pay the buy-back premium, certified acts of terrorism may then be excluded from the policy, subject, however, to state specific requirements. Terrorism coverage
  cannot be excluded from workers’ compensation policies. Subject to a premium-based deductible and provided that we have otherwise complied with all the requirements as specified under TRIPRA, we are eligible for reimbursement by the Federal Government for up to 85% of our covered terrorism-related losses arising from
  a certified terrorist attack. Such payment by the government will, in effect, provide reinsurance protection on a quota share basis. The maximum liability during a program year, including both the Federal Government’s and insurers’ shares, is capped on an aggregated basis at $100 billion. While regulations have been
  promulgated by the Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) requiring that Treasury advise participating insurers, such as the Company, in advance of reaching the $100 billion aggregate limit that such aggregate limit could be reached during the program year, there is a risk that the Company will not be given adequate notice
  of the potential exhaustion of that aggregate limit. Accordingly, the Company could overpay with regard to such losses, and it is unlikely Treasury would reimburse the Company for such losses; moreover, it is unclear whether the Company, in the event of an overpayment, would be able to recover the amount of any such
  overpayment.
We believe that TRIP and the related legislation have been an effective mechanism to assist policyholders and industry participants with the extreme contingent losses that might be caused by acts of terrorism. Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that TRIPRA will be extended beyond 2014, and its expiration or a
  significant change in terms could have an adverse effect on us, our clients or the insurance industry.
The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate in more than 20 countries around the world as well as in all 50 U.S. states. Our operations in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance
  subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things, these subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition and restrict payments of dividends, distributions and reductions of capital in certain circumstances.
  Statutes, regulations and policies that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain investments and distribute funds.
In recent years, the U.S. insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act requires many federal agencies to adopt new rules and regulations that will apply to the financial services industry and also calls for many
  studies regarding various industry practices. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act created a Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury that is focused on national coordination of the insurance sector, systemic risk mitigation and international regulatory cooperation. Although the Federal Insurance Office currently does not
  directly regulate the insurance industry, under the Dodd-Frank Act it has the power to preempt state insurance regulations that are inconsistent with international agreements regarding insurance regulation, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Federal Insurance Office must submit a
  report to Congress on improving U.S. insurance regulation, which must cover the feasibility of future federal regulation of the U.S. insurance industry. This study or one of the various other studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action, which could negatively impact our business
  and financial results. While we have not yet been required to make material changes to our business or operations as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, due to the complexity and broad scope of the Dodd-Frank Act and the time required for regulatory implementation, it is not certain what the scope of 
39



future rulemaking or interpretive guidance from the SEC, CFTC or other regulatory agencies may be, and what impact this will have on our compliance costs, business, operations and profitability.
In addition, some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies. Moreover, the NAIC, which is the organization of insurance regulators from the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the four U.S.
  territories, as well as state insurance regulators, regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations.
In addition to these proposals and initiatives in the United States, new capital adequacy and risk management regulations, called Solvency II, were expected to be implemented throughout the European Union by January 1, 2014. However, due to a delay in the vote on the Omnibus II directive by the European Parliament
  from October 22, 2012, then to November 20, 2012 to the current schedule of March 2013, it is widely accepted that this implementation date will not be met. The Central Bank of Ireland has informed us that it will be our group supervisor under Solvency II. See “Business – Regulation”. Regulations and legislation relating
  to capital adequacy and risk management are also in the process of being developed or implemented in other jurisdictions. There remains significant uncertainty as to the impact that these various regulations and legislation will have on us; however, such impact could include constraints on our ability to move capital between
  subsidiaries or require that additional capital be provided to subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions, which may impact our profitability.
Our Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries are subject to the BMA’s risk-based capital standards for (re)insurance companies, which impose required levels of statutory capital and surplus on our Bermuda-based operating standards. While our Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries currently have excess capital and surplus
  under these requirements, there can be no assurance that such requirements or similar regulations, in their current form or as may be amended in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain desired exemptions from, revised statutes, regulations and policies that govern the conduct of our business. Failure to comply with, or to obtain desired authorizations and/or exemptions under, any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business
  or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions. In addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which we are, or may become subject, or in the interpretations thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies, could have a
  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Potential government intervention in our industry as a result of recent events and instability in the marketplace for insurance products could hinder our flexibility and negatively affect the business opportunities that may be available to us in the market.
Government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers.
  While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives, such proposals could adversely affect our business by, among other things:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target, e.g., the creation or expansion of state or federal catastrophe funds such as those in Florida;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    requiring our participation in industry pools and guarantee associations;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    expanding the scope of coverage or altering the enforceability of deductibles under existing policies;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    ordering the suspension of or otherwise altering the application of insurance laws or regulations; or
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.
    
  



The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability, which may result in unexpected claims frequency and severity and delays or cancelations of products and services by insureds, insurers and reinsurers which could adversely affect our
  business.
For further information regarding government regulation and/or intervention in response to the financial and credit crises, see risk factor entitled “There can be no assurance as to the effect that governmental actions will have on the marketplace generally or on us in particular” above.
40



Consolidation in the insurance industry could adversely impact us.
Insurance industry participants may seek to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Continued consolidation within the insurance industry will further enhance the already competitive underwriting environment as we would likely experience more robust competition from larger, better capitalized competitors. These
  consolidated entities may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to negotiate price reductions for our products and services, and reduce their use of reinsurance, and, as such, we may experience rate declines and possibly write less business.
The loss of one or more key executives or the inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to conduct business.
Our success depends on our ability to attract new, highly skilled individuals and to motivate and retain our existing key executives and qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to attract, motivate and retain other highly skilled individuals in the future could adversely affect
  our ability to conduct our business. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to our employees.
A decrease in the fair values of our reporting units may result in future goodwill impairments.
When we acquire an entity, the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. We conduct impairment tests on our reported goodwill at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. In performing a goodwill impairment test, we use various methods and
  make various assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units, including the determination of expected future cash flows and/or profitability of such reporting units, and we take into account market value multiples and/or cash flows of entities that we deem to be comparable in nature, scope or size to our
  reporting units. However, expected future cash flows and/or profitability may be materially and negatively impacted as a result of, among other things, a decrease in renewal activity and new business opportunities, a decrease in retention or our underwriting teams, lower-than-expected yields and/or cash flows from our
  investment portfolio or higher-than-expected claims activity and magnitude of incurred losses and general economic factors that impact the reporting unit. In addition, previously determined market value multiples and/or cash flows may no longer be relevant as a result of these potential factors. As a result of these potential
  changes, the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units may decrease, causing the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit to exceed the fair value of such net assets. If we determine an impairment exists, we adjust the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. The impairment
  charge is recorded in our income statement in the period in which the impairment is determined. If we are required in the future to record additional goodwill impairments, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. In connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for
  goodwill, the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and assumptions, and actual results may ultimately be materially different from such estimates and assumptions.
Provisions in our Articles of Association may reduce the voting rights of our ordinary shares.
Our Articles of Association generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote, on a non-cumulative basis, at all meetings of shareholders. However, the voting power that may be exercised by certain persons or groups may not equal or exceed 10% or more of
  the voting power conferred by our shares.
In particular, our Articles of Association provide that if, and for so long as, the votes conferred by the Controlled Shares (as defined below) of any person constitute 10% or more of the votes conferred by all our issued shares, the voting rights with respect to the Controlled Shares of such person shall be limited, in the
  aggregate, to a voting power equal to approximately (but slightly less than) 10%, pursuant to a formula set forth in the our Articles of Association. “Controlled Shares” of a person (as defined in our Articles of Association) include (1) all of our shares owned directly, indirectly or constructively by that person (within the
  meaning of Section 958 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRS Code”), and (2) all of our shares owned directly, indirectly or constructively by that person or any “group” of which that person is a part, within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
41



Provisions in our Articles of Association may restrict the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares.
Our Articles of Association provide that our Board of Directors shall decline to register a transfer of shares if it appears to our Board of Directors, whether before or after such transfer, that the effect of such transfer would be to increase the number of Controlled Shares of any person to 10% or more of any class of our
  voting shares, of our total issued shares, or of the total voting power of our total issued shares.
Certain provisions in our charter documents could, among other things, impede an attempt to replace our directors or impose restrictions with respect to a change of control, which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares.
Our Articles of Association contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, limitations on the ability of shareholders to remove
  directors, limitations on voting rights and certain transfer restrictions on our ordinary shares.
As an Irish company, we are subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, under which our Board of Directors is not permitted to take any action that might “frustrate” an offer for our shares once the Board of Directors has received an offer or has reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent without the approval of more
  than 50% of shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of shareholders and/or the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel. This could limit the ability of the Board of Directors to take defensive actions even if the Board of Directors believes that such defensive actions would be in the best interests of the Company and its
  shareholders.
The Irish Takeover Rules also could discourage an investor from acquiring 30% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares unless such investor was prepared to make a bid to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares. Further, it could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated
  transaction because of heightened shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions under Irish law.
In addition, insurance regulations in certain jurisdictions may also delay or prevent a change of control or limit the ability of a shareholder to acquire in excess of specified amounts of our ordinary shares.
Irish shareholder voting requirements may limit flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.
Irish law allows shareholders to authorize a board of directors to issue shares subsequent to receipt of authorization without further shareholder approval, but this authorization must be renewed after five years. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory pre-emption rights to existing ordinary
  shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows such shareholders to authorize the waiver of such statutory pre-emption rights for five years. Our Articles of Association currently provide authority to the Board of Directors to issue shares without further shareholder approval and to waive ordinary
  shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights. However, these authorizations expire in 2015, unless renewed by XL-Ireland’s shareholders, and we can provide no assurance that these authorizations and waivers will always be renewed, which could limit our ability to issue equity in the future.
It may be difficult to enforce judgments against XL-Ireland, XL-Cayman or their directors and executive officers.
XL-Ireland is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ireland. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such directors and officers are located outside the United States. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of
  process within the United States upon those persons or to recover on judgments of U.S. courts against us or our directors and officers, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. We have been advised that there is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for
  the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      the judgment must be for a definite sum;
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    the judgment must be final and conclusive; and
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    
  



42



An Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment.
In addition, XL-Cayman is incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Cayman Islands and is an Irish tax resident. Requirements for enforceability of foreign judgments in Ireland are summarized above. We have been advised that there is doubt as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would enforce:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws obtained in actions against XL-Cayman or its directors and officers who reside outside the United States; or
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against these persons or XL-Cayman predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
    
  



We have also been advised that there is no treaty in effect between the United States and the Cayman Islands providing for such enforcement and there are grounds upon which Cayman Islands courts may not enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some
  remedies available under U.S. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in Cayman Islands courts as contrary to public policy.
Current, pending or future lawsuits against us, including putative class action lawsuits, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or year.
We are subject to lawsuits and arbitrations in the regular course of our business. An adverse resolution of one or more lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or year.
Changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results.
Unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in
  current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, net equity and other relevant financial statement line items and the timing of when impairments and other charges are tested or taken. In particular, recent guidance and ongoing projects put in place by
  standard setters globally have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward more “fair value” based models which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants.
There is a possibility that the Master Agreement entered into at the time of the sale of Syncora and the related commutations and releases could be challenged or that we could be subject to litigation as a result of the Master Agreement. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our financial
  condition, results of operations, liquidity or the market price of our securities.
We provided certain reinsurance protections (the “Reinsurance Agreements”) with respect to adverse development on certain transactions as well as indemnification under specific facultative and excess of loss coverages for subsidiaries of Syncora: Syncora Guarantee Re and Syncora Guarantee. At June 30, 2008, our total
  net exposure under facultative agreements with Syncora subsidiaries was approximately $6.4 billion of net par value outstanding. Pursuant to the closing of the Master Agreement, all of these Reinsurance Agreements were commuted.
In addition, through one or more of our subsidiaries, we entered into certain agreements with subsidiaries of Syncora pursuant to which we guaranteed certain obligations of Syncora Guarantee Re and Syncora Guarantee under specific agreements (the “Guarantee Agreements”). At June 30, 2008, the total net par value
  outstanding of business written by subsidiaries of Syncora which fell under the Guarantee Agreements was approximately $60 billion. Pursuant to the terms of, and required conditions under, the Master Agreement, Syncora Guarantee Re’s facultative quota share reinsurance agreement with Syncora Guarantee, and all individual
  risk cessions thereunder, and the Financial Security Master Facultative 
43



Agreement, and all individual risk cessions thereunder, were commuted, thereby rendering the Syncora Guarantee Re guarantee and Financial Security guarantee of no further force and effect.
Following the closing of the Master Agreement, Syncora and its applicable subsidiaries were required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commute the underlying financial guarantees that we had issued to the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) in connection with financial guaranty policies between certain
  subsidiaries of Syncora Holdings and EIB. This was completed in June 2010.
Under federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws (including those applicable in any state insurance insolvency proceeding), Syncora’s commutation and release of our obligations pursuant to the Master Agreement and related agreements would constitute a voidable fraudulent
  transfer if it was determined that Syncora or any applicable subsidiary thereto, at the time it entered into the Master Agreement or such related agreement:

  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      intended to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors; or
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    received less than “reasonably equivalent value” or “fair value consideration” for such release; and either:
    
  






  
     

  
  
    
      •
     
     
     
    
      was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence; or
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or
  
  
     

  
  
    
    •
     
    
     
     
    
    intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.
    
  



Among other regulatory approvals obtained in connection with the Master Agreement and the commutation of the Syncora Guarantee Re/Syncora Guarantee Quota Share, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) issued an approval letter to Syncora Guarantee under Section 1505 of the New York
  Insurance Law and the Delaware Insurance Department (“DID”) issued an approval letter to Syncora Guarantee Re under Section 5005(a) of the Delaware Insurance Code (effective upon Syncora Guarantee Re’s redomestication to Delaware) (both of which require that the terms of a transaction between an issuer and one or
  more of its affiliates be fair and equitable) stating, in the case of NYDFS, that the terms of the Master Agreement and each of the commutations are fair and equitable to Syncora Guarantee and do not adversely affect policyholders of Syncora Guarantee and, in the case of the DID, stating that the terms of the Master
  Agreement and the commutation of the Syncora Guarantee Re/Syncora Guarantee Quota Share were fair and equitable to Syncora Guarantee. The BMA (the domiciliary regulator of Syncora Guarantee Re) also issued an approval letter approving the Master Agreement and each commutation to which Syncora Guarantee Re is
  a party, including the Syncora Guarantee Re/Syncora Guarantee Quota Share.
There can be no assurance that a court would agree with our, the NYDFS’s, the DID’s, the BMA’s or Syncora’s conclusions, or as to what law or standard a court would ultimately apply in making any such determination or as to how such court would ultimately rule. Further, there can be no assurance that the
  enforceability of the Master Agreement, the agreements relating thereto and the transactions contemplated thereunder will not be challenged, including under applicable fraudulent transfer laws and/or by asserting any number of other theories for recovery, including third-party beneficiary rights, or that other litigation will not
  be commenced against us as a result of the Master Agreement and such related agreements and transactions. Additionally, in the event of any liquidation or rehabilitation or similar proceeding of any insurance subsidiary of Syncora, there can be no assurance that any insurance regulator or regulators responsible for such
  proceedings, in their capacity as liquidator or rehabilitator, would respect the insurance regulatory approvals obtained in connection with the Master Agreement.
We and our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. tax, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.
We take the position that neither we nor any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries are engaged in a U.S. trade or business through a U.S. permanent establishment. Accordingly, we take the position that none of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and
  reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income). However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, we cannot be certain that
  the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not contend successfully that 
44



we or any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If we or any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States, any such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes
  on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Changes in U.S. tax law might adversely affect an investment in our shares.
Legislation may be introduced in the U.S. Congress attempting to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the U.S. but have certain U.S. affiliates. For example, one legislative proposal could impose additional limits on the deductibility of
  interest by foreign-owned U.S. corporations. Another legislative proposal could modify the standards that indicate when a non-U.S. corporation might be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it were considered to be primarily managed and controlled in the U.S. In addition, legislation has been
  proposed in the U.S. that would severely restrict the ability of a company to utilize affiliate reinsurance to manage its U.S. risks and its capital position. Various proposals have been made that would effectively disallow (in some cases permanently and in others temporarily) part or all of the deduction for premiums ceded to
  affiliates If any of these proposals, or a similar proposal using the same underlying principles, is enacted, the resulting impact to the Company could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. It is possible that other legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could also have an adverse impact on us or our
  shareholders.
Additionally, the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations, including those regarding whether a company is engaged in a trade or business (or has a permanent establishment) within the United States or is a Passive Foreign Investment Company (“PFIC”), or whether U.S. holders would be required to include in
  their gross income “subpart F income” or the related person insurance income, which we refer to as “RPII” of a Controlled Foreign Corporation (“CFC”), are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. There are currently no regulations regarding the application of the PFIC rules to insurance companies and the
  regulations regarding RPII are still in proposed form. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming. We cannot be certain if, when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.
We cannot assure you that future legislative action will not increase the amount of U.S. tax payable by us. If an increase occurs, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
There is U.S. income tax risk associated with reinsurance between U.S. insurance companies and their Bermuda affiliates.
As discussed above, Congress has periodically considered legislation intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of non-U.S. insurance companies and U.S. insurance companies with non-U.S. affiliates, including perceived tax benefits resulting principally from reinsurance between or among U.S. insurance
  companies and their non-U.S. affiliates. In this regard, section 845 of the IRS Code was amended in 2004 to permit the IRS to reallocate, recharacterize or adjust items of income, deduction or certain other items related to a reinsurance agreement between related parties to reflect the proper “amount, source or character” for
  each item (in contrast to prior law, which only covered “source and character”). If the IRS were to successfully challenge our reinsurance arrangements under section 845, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has implemented measures and may implement further measures that might change the manner in which we are taxed.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) published its current tax agenda in May 2012. In this report, the OECD refers to a number of ongoing initiatives. Any measures implemented as a result of these initiatives could have an impact on how we and other multinational organizations
  are taxed. We are not able to predict the impact on our tax position from the implementation of any such measures.
The OECD’s “Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments” (the “Report”), issued in 2008, summarized the OECD’s initiative to establish a broad consensus regarding the interpretation and 
45



practical application of Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (“Article 7”). Article 7 sets forth international tax principles for attributing profits to a permanent establishment and forms the basis of an extensive network of bilateral income tax treaties between OECD member countries and
  between many OECD member and non-member countries. Part IV of the Report addresses the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment of an enterprise that conducts insurance activities. In 2010, a new version of Article 7 and related commentary was adopted to be used in the negotiation of new treaties and
  amendments to existing treaties. Although provisions of this new version of Article 7 and related commentary have not and are not expected to change materially the manner in which we are taxed, there can be no assurance that future OECD recommendations related to the Report may not have an adverse impact on us.
If an investor acquires 10% or more of our ordinary shares, it may be subject to taxation under the “controlled foreign corporation” rules.
Under certain circumstances, a U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of a foreign corporation that is a CFC (a foreign corporation in which 10% U.S. shareholders own more than 50% of the voting power of the foreign corporation or more than 25% of a foreign insurance company) for an
  uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year must include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such “10% U.S. Shareholder’s” pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income,” even if the subpart F income is not distributed to such 10% U.S. Shareholder, if such 10% U.S. Shareholder owns
  (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) any shares of the foreign corporation on the last day of the corporation’s taxable year. “Subpart F income” of a foreign insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income (such as interest, dividends and other types of passive income), as well as
  insurance and reinsurance income (including underwriting and investment income) attributable to the insurance of risks situated outside the CFC’s country of incorporation.
While provisions in our organizational documents serve to limit voting power on our ordinary shares, it is possible, that the IRS could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge, in which case an investor’s investment could be materially adversely affected, if the investor
  is considered to own 10% or more of our shares.
U.S. Persons who hold shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If we are considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person who owns any of our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed, in which case an investor’s
  investment could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we were considered a PFIC, upon the death of any U.S. individual owning shares, such individual’s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a “step-up” in the basis of the shares that might otherwise be available under U.S. federal income tax laws. We believe
  that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be deemed a PFIC by the IRS in the future. If we were considered a PFIC, it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is
  subject to U.S. federal income taxation. There are currently no regulations regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such guidance would have on an investor
  that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation.
There are U.S. income tax risks associated with the related person insurance income of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
If (i) the related person insurance income, which we refer to as “RPII,” of any one of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed 20% of that subsidiary’s gross insurance income in any taxable year and (ii) U.S. persons were treated as owning 25% or more of the subsidiary’s stock (by vote or value), a
  U.S. person who owns any ordinary shares, directly or indirectly, on the last day of such taxable year on which the 25% threshold is met would be required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that person’s ratable share of that subsidiary’s RPII for the taxable year, determined as if that RPII were
  distributed proportionately only to U.S. holders at that date, regardless of whether that income is distributed. The amount of RPII earned by a subsidiary (generally premium and related investment income from the direct or indirect insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect U.S. holder 
46



of shares of that subsidiary or any person related to that holder) would depend on a number of factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by that subsidiary. Although we do not believe that the 20% threshold will be met in respect of any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, some of
  the factors that may affect the result in any period may be beyond our control. Consequently, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not exceed the RPII threshold in any taxable year.
The RPII rules provide that if a holder who is a U.S. person disposes of shares in a non-U.S. insurance corporation that had RPII (even if the 20% gross income threshold was not met) and met the 25% ownership threshold at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition, and the holder owned
  any stock at such time, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holder’s share (taking into account certain rules for determining a U.S. holder’s share of RPII) of the corporation’s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned
  the shares (possibly whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, such a shareholder will be required to comply with specified reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned. We believe that these rules should not apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares because XL-
  Ireland is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business. We cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the IRS will not successfully assert that these rules apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares.
We and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries may become subject to taxes in Bermuda in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and your investment.
Our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries have received from the Ministry of Finance in Bermuda exemptions from any Bermuda taxes that might be imposed on profits, income or any capital asset, gain or appreciation until March 31, 2035. The exemptions are subject to the proviso that they are not construed so as to prevent
  the application of any tax or duty to persons who are ordinarily residents in Bermuda (the Company and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are not so currently designated) and to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to the
  land leased to us and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries. XL-Ireland and other Bermuda-based subsidiaries not incorporated in Bermuda have also received similar exemptions as permit companies under the Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda. These exemptions are expected to be extended to 2035. Our Bermuda insurance
  subsidiaries are required to pay certain annual Bermuda government fees and certain business fees as an insurer under The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda. Currently there is no Bermuda withholding tax on dividends paid by our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries to us. There can be no assurance that the tax rules as presently
  applied may not change in the future.
XL-Cayman may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands after June 2, 2018, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.
For tax purposes, XL-Cayman is resident in Ireland by virtue of central management and control. In the event Cayman introduces a corporate income tax based on place of incorporation, XL-Cayman would be a dual resident company and potentially subject to tax in both Ireland and Cayman. As there is no double tax
  treaty between the Cayman Islands and Ireland, XL-Cayman could become subject to taxation in both Ireland and Cayman. Under current Cayman Islands law, we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on our income or gains. We have received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the Cayman
  Islands pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Law, as amended, that until June 2, 2018, (i) no subsequently enacted law imposing any tax on profits, income, gains or appreciation shall apply to us and (ii) no such tax and no tax in the nature of an estate duty or an inheritance tax shall be payable on any of our
  ordinary shares, debentures or other obligations. Given the limited duration of the undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the Cayman Islands, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Cayman Islands tax after June 2, 2018. Such taxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
  results of operations and your investment.
Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof.
Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities in Ireland, the United States and other jurisdictions, and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic 
47



trends in such jurisdictions, particularly if such trends continue. For example, Ireland has suffered from the consequences of worldwide adverse economic conditions and the credit ratings on its debt have been downgraded. Such tax law changes could cause a material and adverse change in our worldwide effective tax rate and
  we may have to take further action, at potentially significant expense, to seek to mitigate the effect of such changes. Any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions, including the United States, could subject us to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense.
Dividends you receive may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and Irish income tax.
Dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on the Company’s ordinary shares. However, a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that ordinary shareholders resident in the United States and ordinary shareholders resident in other specified countries
  (listed in Annex F attached to the Redomestication Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 10, 2010) may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax if they complete and file certain dividend withholding tax forms. Ordinary shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their ordinary shares through the
  Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such ordinary shares in the records of the brokers holding such ordinary shares are in the United States (so that such brokers can further transmit the relevant information to a qualifying
  intermediary appointed by the Company). Similarly, ordinary shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their ordinary shares directly instead of beneficially through DTC are not subject to dividend withholding tax if such ordinary shareholders held ordinary shares in the Company on January 12, 2010 and they provided a
  valid Form W-9 showing a U.S. address to the Company’s transfer agent. However, other ordinary shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.
In addition, ordinary shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from the Company should not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends, unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their ordinary shareholdings in the Company. Ordinary
  shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their ordinary shareholding in the Company.
A future transfer of your ordinary shares, other than one effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.
Transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. The majority of our ordinary shares will be traded through DTC, either directly or through brokers who hold such ordinary shares on behalf of customers through DTC. However, if
  you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC (or through a broker that holds your ordinary shares through DTC), any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares
  acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.
