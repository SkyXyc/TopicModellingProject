align=justify>ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Southwestern Energy
Company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and crude oil
exploration, development and production (E&P). We are also focused on
creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and
marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services.  

Exploration and
Production - Our primary business is the exploration for and production of
natural gas within the United States, with our current operations being
principally focused on development of an unconventional gas reservoir located on
the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which we refer to as the Fayetteville
Shale play.  We are also actively engaged in exploration and production
activities in Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania.  We conduct our exploration
and production operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc., or
SEECO, and Southwestern Energy Production Company, or SEPCO. SEECO operates
exclusively in Arkansas where it holds a large base of both developed and
undeveloped gas reserves, and conducts the Fayetteville Shale drilling program
and the conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program in the Arkoma Basin. SEPCO
conducts development drilling and exploration programs in the Oklahoma portion
of the Arkoma Basin as well as in Texas and Pennsylvania.  DeSoto Drilling,
Inc., or DDI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEPCO, operates drilling rigs in the
Fayetteville Shale play and in East Texas.  

Midstream Services
- We engage in gas gathering activities in Arkansas and Texas through our
gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company, L.L.C., which we refer to as
DeSoto Gathering, and Angelina Gathering Company, L.L.C., which we refer to as
Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering and Angelina Gathering primarily support
our E&P operations and generate revenue from gathering fees associated with
the transportation of our and third party gas to market. Our gas marketing
subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Services Company, or SES, captures downstream
opportunities which arise through marketing and transportation activity of the
gas produced in our E&P operations.  

The vast majority of our
operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion
and amortization, or EBITDA, is derived from our E&P business.  In
2009, absent our $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash
ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties, 86% of our
operating income and 90% of our EBITDA were generated from our E&P business,
compared to 92% of our operating income and 89% of our EBITDA in 2008 and 94% of
our operating income and 95% of our EBITDA in 2007. In 2009, 14% of our
operating income, absent the non-cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas
and oil properties, and 10% of our EBITDA were generated from Midstream
Services, compared to 7% of our operating income and 5% of our EBITDA in 2008
and 3% of our operating income and 3% of our EBITDA in 2007. In 2008 and 2007,
the remainder of our EBITDA was generated from our Gas Distribution business
which was sold effective July 1, 2008.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.
 We refer you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that reconciles
EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy.
  

Our Business
Strategy
We are focused on
providing long-term growth in the net asset value of our business.  In our
E&P business, we prepare an economic analysis for each investment
opportunity based upon the expected present value added for each dollar to be
invested, which we refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI.  The PVI of the
future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount
rate.  We target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre-tax PVI for each
dollar we invest in our E&P projects.  Our actual PVI results are
utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments.
 The key elements of our business strategy are:

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 24px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Exploit and Develop Our Position in the Fayetteville Shale.
 We seek to maximize the value of our significant acreage position in the
Fayetteville Shale play, which we believe will continue to provide significant
production and reserve growth. We intend to further develop our acreage position
and improve our well results through the use of advanced technologies and
detailed technical analysis of our properties. During 2009, primarily as a
result of the economic recession, natural gas prices fell to their lowest levels
over the last 7 years and if natural gas prices rebound in 2010 we could
increase our planned investments and accelerate the development of our
Fayetteville Shale play by utilizing additional drilling rigs.

align=justify>Maximize Efficiency through Economies of Scale.
 In our key operating areas, the concentration of our properties allows
us to achieve economies of scale that result in lower costs.  In our
Fayetteville Shale play, we have achieved significant cost savings by operating
a fleet of drilling rigs designed specifically for the play and from our other
associated oilfield services.  We seek to serve as the operator of the
wells in which we have a significant interest.  As the operator, we are
better positioned to control the enhancing, drilling, completing and producing
of wells and the marketing of production to minimize costs and maximize both
production volumes and realized price.

Operations.  We seek to maximize profitability by exercising
control over the delivery of natural gas from the areas where we have
production.  We have continued to design and improve our gas gathering
infrastructure to better manage the physical movement of our production and the
costs of our operations.  As of December 31, 2009, we have invested
approximately $548.9 million in the 1,137 mile gas gathering system built for
our Fayetteville Shale play which was gathering approximately 1.3 Bcf per day at
year-end. We intend to invest $270 million in our Midstream operations in 2010
to continue the expansion of our infrastructure.  We have also been
proactive in encouraging the construction of interstate pipelines to provide
access to increase the markets in which we can sell our production.  Our
marketing subsidiary is a “foundation shipper” on two Fayetteville Shale
pipeline projects that will provide access to the eastern and southern United
States.

 We actively seek to find and develop new oil and gas plays with
significant exploration and exploitation potential, which we refer to as “New
Ventures.” New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on repeatability,
multi-well potential and land availability as well as other criteria, and can be
located both inside and outside of the United States.  Our Fayetteville
Shale play and our Marcellus Shale play began as a New Ventures projects in 2002
and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we held 36,125 net undeveloped
acres in New Ventures projects. In addition to New Ventures prospects, we also
strategically seek to expand existing operations including joint ventures,
farm-ins or farm-outs.
Recent
Developments
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our planned capital investment program for 2010 is approximately
$2.1 billion, which includes approximately $1.7 billion for our E&P segment,
$270 million for our Midstream Services segment and $95 million for corporate
and other purposes.  Our 2010 capital program is expected to be primarily
funded by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our $1 billion
revolving credit facility.  The planned capital program for 2010 is
flexible and can be adjusted to reflect market conditions.  We will
reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing
market conditions. Based on our capital program, we also announced our targeted
2010 gas and oil production of approximately 400 to 410 Bcfe, an increase of
approximately 35% over our 2009 production (using the midpoint of targeted 2010
gas and oil production).
Exploration and
Production
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"
align=justify>Overview
Our operations are
primarily focused on the Fayetteville Shale, an unconventional reservoir located
in the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas. We also conduct conventional operations in the
Arkoma Basin where we target Atokan-age gas reservoirs. In addition to our
Arkansas operations, we conduct both conventional and unconventional operations
in East Texas primarily targeting the Cotton Valley, James Lime, Pettet,
Haynesville Shale and Middle Bossier formations. We also hold a significant
acreage position in northeastern Pennsylvania that we will begin drilling in
2010 targeting the Marcellus Shale. We continue to actively seek to develop both
conventional and unconventional natural gas and oil resource plays with
significant exploration and exploitation potential.

Our E&P segment
recorded an operating loss of $157.7 million in 2009 as a result of the
recognition of a $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash
ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded for the
three months ended March 31, 2009 due to a significant decline in natural gas
prices. Our E&P segment recorded operating income of $813.5 million in 2008
and $358.1 million in 2007. The operating loss in 2009 was primarily due to the
recognition of this ceiling test impairment, however, even without the
write-down, operating income would have decreased, when compared to 2008
operating income, due to lower prices realized from the sale of our production
and an increase in operating costs and expenses which more than offset the
higher revenues realized from increased gas production.  EBITDA from our
E&P segment was $1.2 billion in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008 and
$640.5 million in 2007. Our EBITDA in 2009 was approximately equal to 2008 as
the impact of our increased production volumes was offset by decreased prices
realized from the sale of our production and increased operating costs and
expenses.  The increases in both our operating income and EBITDA in 2008
when compared to 2007 were due to increased production volumes and higher
realized prices, partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses.
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to “Business — Other Items —
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy.

Our Proved
Reserves
Our estimated proved
natural gas and oil reserves were 3,657 Bcfe at year-end 2009, compared to 2,185
Bcfe at year-end 2008 and 1,450 Bcfe at year-end 2007. The overall increase
in total estimated proved reserves in the past three years is primarily due to
the development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. In 2009, the SEC
adopted a number of  revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosure
requirements which are effective for this Form 10-K and accordingly, our
estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves as of December 31, 2009 were
valued utilizing the average prices in the 12-month period, which is defined,
with certain exceptions, as the unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, of $3.87 per Mcf
for natural gas and $57.65 per barrel for oil. The market prices for natural gas
and crude oil used in calculating the value of our estimated proved natural gas
and oil reserves for 2008 and 2007 were single day prices permitted to be used
under the SEC’s prior rules, which were $5.71 per Mcf for natural gas and $41.00
per barrel for oil at year-end 2008 and $6.80 per Mcf and $92.50 per barrel at
year-end 2007. 

The after-tax PV-10, or
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas
and oil reserve quantities, was $1.8 billion at year-end 2009, compared to $2.1
billion at year-end 2008 and $2.0 billion at year-end 2007.  The
decrease in the after-tax PV-10 value in 2009 is primarily due to a comparative
decrease in the average 2009 price from the year-end 2008 gas price and higher
operating and future development costs which were partially offset by an
increase in reserves. Our proved reserves are almost entirely natural gas and as
such the after-tax PV-10 measure is highly dependent upon the natural gas price
used in the after-tax PV-10 calculation. The reconciling difference in after-tax
PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2009
Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the
discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our
year-end 2009 estimated proved reserves had a present value of estimated future
net cash flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $2.3 billion, compared to
$3.0 billion at year-end 2008 and $2.6 billion at year-end 2007.  

We believe that the
pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved
reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value.
 While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that
are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the
unique tax situation of each individual company.  We understand that
securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s
current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies
without regard to income taxes.  We refer you to Note 4 in the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure
of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas and oil
reserves, to the risk factor “Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve
data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate”
in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K, and to “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement
about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and
estimated reserve data.

Approximately 100% of
our year-end 2009 estimated proved reserves were natural gas and 54% were
classified as proved developed, compared to 100% and 62%, respectively, in 2008
and 96% and 64%, respectively, in 2007.  We operate approximately 94% of
our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing
reserves, and our reserve life index approximated 12.2 years at year-end
2009.  Sales of natural gas production accounted for nearly 100% of total
operating revenues for this segment in 2009, 97% in 2008 and 94% in 2007.

costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 1,677 Bcfe as of December 31, 2009,
will require us to invest an additional $2.3 billion in order for those reserves
to be brought to production.  Our ability to make the necessary investments
to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our
control.  A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period of
time could result in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce,
leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows.  We refer you to the
risk factors “A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices
would have a material adverse affect on us,” “We may have difficulty financing
our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth” and

may adversely affect operations and limit our growth” in Item 1A of Part I of
this Form 10-K and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Our Reserve Replacement

The ability of an
E&P company to add new reserves to replace the reserves that are being
depleted by its current production volumes is viewed by many investors as an
indication of its long-term prospects. Reserves additions can be proved
developed. The reserve replacement ratio, which we discuss below, is an
important analytical measure used within the E&P industry by investors and
peers to evaluate performance results.  There are limitations as to the
usefulness of this measure as it does not reflect the type of reserves or the
cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of the reserve
additions.  Our reserve replacement ratio has averaged over 500% during the
last three years, primarily driven by increases in the reserves associated with
our Fayetteville Shale play. 

In 2009, we replaced
592% of our production volumes with an increase of 1,685 Bcfe of proved natural
gas and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward
revisions of 92.9 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 757.6 Bcfe were proved
developed and 927.5 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve revisions
during 2009 were primarily due to 384.8 Bcfe in upward revisions related to the
improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset
by downward reserve revisions of 251.5 Bcfe due to a comparative decrease in the
average gas price for 2009 as compared to year-end 2008.  Additionally, we
had downward performance revisions of 25.5 Bcfe and 15.1 Bcfe in our East Texas
and conventional Arkoma Basin operating areas, respectively.

In 2008, our reserve
replacement ratio was 523% (from reserve additions of 920.2 Bcfe primarily
driven by our drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play), including net
upward revisions of 98.1 Bcfe. Of the 2008 reserve additions, 568.2 Bcfe were
proved developed and 352.0 Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  The improved
performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play resulted in upward
performance reserve revisions of 159.7 Bcf during 2008, which were partially
offset by downward reserve revisions of 58.7 Bcfe due to a comparative decrease
in year-end gas prices and performance revisions in our conventional Arkoma and
East Texas operating areas.  Additionally, our reserves decreased by 89.5
Bcfe as a result of our sale of oil and gas leases and wells in 2008.

In 2007, our reserve
replacement ratio was 474% (from reserve additions of 507.9 Bcfe primarily
driven by our drilling programs in the Fayetteville Shale play), including net
upward reserve revisions of 31.0 Bcfe.  Of the 2007 reserve additions,
281.2 Bcfe were proved developed and 226.7 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The
upward reserve revisions during 2007 were primarily due to improved performance
of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play.

For the period ending
December 31, 2009, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio,
including revisions, was 548%. Our reserve replacement ratio for 2009, excluding
the effect of reserve revisions, was 561%, compared to 473% in 2008 and 447% in
2007. Excluding reserve revisions, our three-year average reserve replacement
ratio is 512%. 

Since 2005, the
substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our
drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play.  We expect our drilling
program in the Fayetteville Shale play to continue to be the primary source of
our reserve additions in the future, however, our ability to add reserves
depends upon many factors that are beyond our control.  We refer you to the
risk factors “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to
change” and “Our exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation
of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns” in Item 1A
of Part I of this Form 10-K and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about
Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a more

Our Operations

Fayetteville Shale Play

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our Fayetteville Shale play is currently the primary focus of our
E&P business. The Fayetteville Shale is a Mississippian-age unconventional
gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in
thickness from 50 to 550 feet and ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet.
 The Barnett Shale found in north Texas is an analogous reservoir.  At
December 31, 2009, we held leases for approximately 888,695 net acres in the
play area (394,538 net undeveloped acres, 368,755 net developed acres held by
Fayetteville Shale production, 123,442 net developed acres held by conventional
production and an additional 1,960 net undeveloped acres in the traditional
Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin), compared to approximately 875,000 net
acres at year-end 2008 and 906,700 net acres at year-end 2007.  The
increase in our acreage during 2009 was primarily due to additional acreage
capture related to the integration of new sections and a small acquisition of
producing properties in the play.  The slight decrease in our net acreage
during 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the sale of 55,631 acres to
XTO Energy, Inc. in April 2008.  
Approximately 3,117 Bcf
of our reserves at year-end 2009 were attributable to our Fayetteville Shale
play, compared to approximately 1,545 Bcf at year-end 2008 and 716 Bcf at
year-end 2007.  Gross production from our operated wells in the
Fayetteville Shale play increased from approximately 720 MMcf per day at the
beginning of 2009 to approximately 1,225 MMcf per day by year-end.  Our net
production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 243.5 Bcf in 2009, compared to
134.5 Bcf in 2008 and 53.5 Bcf in 2007. In 2010, our estimated production from
the Fayetteville Shale play is expected to range between 344 and 352 Bcf.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our leases generally require that we drill at least one producing
well per governmental drilling unit (640 acres) in order to prevent our leases
from expiring upon the expiration date.  At year-end 2009, approximately
48% of our leasehold acreage was held by production, excluding our acreage in
the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin.  We refer you to the
risk factor “If we fail to drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our
Fayetteville Shale acreage, the initial lease terms could expire, which would
result in the loss of certain leasehold rights” in Item 1A of Part I of this
Form 10-K.  Excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway, our acreage
position was obtained at an average cost of approximately $203 per acre with an
average royalty interest of 15% and the undeveloped portion of our acreage had
an average remaining lease term of 3 years.  For more information about our
acreage and well count, we refer you to “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this
Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2009,
we had spud a total of 1,792 wells in the play, 1,437 of which were operated by
us and 355 of which were outside-operated wells.  Of the wells spud, 570
were in 2009, 604 were in 2008 and 415 were in 2007.  Of the wells spud in
2009, 565 were designated as horizontal wells.  At year-end 2009, 1,288
wells had been drilled and completed, including 1,201 horizontal wells.  Of
the 1,201 horizontal wells, 1,178 wells were fracture stimulated using either
slickwater or crosslinked gel stimulation treatments, or a combination
thereof.

During 2009, we
continued to improve our drilling practices in the Fayetteville Shale play.
 Our horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $2.9 million
per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,100 feet and average time to
drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry.  This compares
to an average completed well cost of $3.0 million per well, average horizontal
lateral length of 3,619 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 14 days
from re-entry to re-entry during 2008.  In 2007, our average completed well
cost was $2.9 million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of
2,657 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 17 days from re-entry to
re-entry.  We also continued to improve our completion practices, as wells
placed on production during 2009 averaged initial production rates of 3,478 Mcf
per day, compared to average initial production rates of 2,777 and 1,687 Mcf per
day in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Since 2007, improvements in our
completion practices and longer lateral lengths have resulted in quarter-

<A

over-quarter improvements in average
initial production rates of operated wells placed on production.  During
2009, we placed 60 wells on production with initial production rates that
exceeded 5.0 MMcf per day, including six wells that exceeded 6.0 MMcf per day
and the play’s highest rate well, the Arklan, Inc. 09-11 #4-32H located in
Cleburne County, with an initial production rate of approximately 7.6 MMcf per
day.  

Beginning in late 2008
and continuing through 2009, we drilled a significant number of wells to test
tighter well spacing. At December 31, 2009, we had placed over 300 wells on
production that have well spacing of 700 feet or less, representing
approximately 65-acre spacing or less, with encouraging results. In areas tested
to date, we expect to drill between 10 and 12 wells per section in the
Fayetteville Shale play, pending additional well data and analyses. We will
continue to focus on optimizing the well spacing for the play and plan to test
over 20 different pilot areas with well spacings that will range from 300 to 600
feet apart as part of our 2010 drilling program.

Our total proved net
reserves booked in the play at year-end 2009 were 3,117 Bcf from a total of
2,675 locations, of which 1,428 were proved developed producing, 97 were proved
developed non-producing and 1,150 were proved undeveloped.  Of the 2,675
locations, 2,609 were horizontal. The average gross proved reserves for the
undeveloped wells included in our year-end reserves was approximately 2.2 Bcf
per well, up from 1.9 Bcf per well at year-end 2008 and 1.5 Bcf per well at
year-end 2007.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in 2008
totaled approximately 1,545 Bcf from a total of 1,508 locations, of which 882
were proved developed producing, 18 were proved developed non-producing and 608
were proved undeveloped.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in
2007 totaled approximately 716 Bcf from a total of 935 locations, of which 497
were proved developed producing, 14 were proved developed non-producing and 424
were proved undeveloped.  If the Fayetteville Shale play continues to be
successfully developed, we expect a continued significant level of proved
undeveloped reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play over the next few years.

In 2009, we invested
approximately $1.3 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included
approximately $1.1 billion to spud 570 wells, 420 of which we operated.  We
increased our reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play by 1,815 Bcf, which
included net upward reserve revisions of 238 Bcf due primarily to improved well
performance which was partially offset by downward revisions due to lower
prices.  Included in our total capital investments in the play during 2009
was $40 million for acquisition of properties, $22 million for seismic and $106
million in capitalized costs and other expenses.  At December 31, 2009, we
had acquired approximately 1,324 square miles of 3-D seismic data, which
provides us with seismic data on approximately 68% of our net acreage position
in the Fayetteville Shale, excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway
portion of the Arkoma Basin.  In 2008, we invested approximately $1.2
billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included $1.0 billion to spud 604
wells, $23 million for acquisition of properties, $61 million for seismic and
$83 million in capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2007, we invested
approximately $960 million in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included $789
million to spud 415 wells, $25 million for acquisition of properties, $97
million for 3-D seismic and $49 million in capitalized costs and other expenses.
 

In 2010, we plan to
invest approximately $1.2 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which includes
participating in approximately 650 to 680 gross wells, 475 to 500 of which are
planned to be operated by us.  

We believe that our
Fayetteville Shale acreage continues to have significant development potential.
 Our strategy going forward is to increase our production through
development drilling, increase the amount of acreage we hold by production and
determine the economic viability of the undrilled portion of our acreage.
 Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play is
flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of
our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and
economic fracture stimulation methods and well spacing, the extent to which we
can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells in
other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas commodity price
environment.  As we continue to gather data about the Fayetteville Shale,
it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling
schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position
should not be pursued at all. We refer you to the risk factor “Our drilling
plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are subject to change” in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K.

Texas since 2000, when we first began our activities in the area targeting the
Cotton Valley sand formation with the purchase of the Overton Field, or Overton,
in Smith County, Texas.  We have expanded our activities to include
additional opportunities at Overton as well as significant potential drilling
targeting the James Lime, Pettet, Haynesville Shale and Middle Bossier
formations.

At December 31, 2009, we
had approximately 330 Bcfe of reserves in East Texas, compared to 351 Bcfe at
year-end 2008 and 353 Bcfe at year-end 2007.  Our proved reserves have
decreased over the past three years primarily due to our annual field production
and downward reserve revisions resulting from comparative decreases in gas
prices and negative performance revisions, which have more than offset our
successful drilling in the James Lime and Haynesville Shale formations.  In
2009, we invested approximately $167 million in East Texas and participated in
46 wells, of which 33 were successful and 13 were in progress at year-end,
resulting in a 100% success rate and adding new reserves of 94 Bcfe.  This
area recorded net downward revisions of approximately 55.3 Bcfe primarily due to
a comparative decrease in the average 2009 gas price from the 2008 year-end gas
price and 25.5 Bcfe of negative performance revisions.  Net production from
East Texas was 34.9 Bcfe in 2009, compared to 31.6 Bcfe in 2008 and 29.9 Bcfe in
2007.  Production has grown over the past three years primarily due to our
successful drilling program in the James Lime formation which, combined with
successful drilling in the Haynesville Shale in 2009, more than offset the
natural production decline at Overton.

Our original interest in
Overton (which was approximately 10,800 gross acres) was acquired in April 2000
for $6 million. Our wells in Overton produce from four Taylor series sands in
the Cotton Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet.  At December 31,
2009, we held approximately 24,400 gross acres in Overton with an average
working interest of 83% and an average net revenue interest of 67%.  In
2009, we invested approximately $4 million to drill two wells at Overton, both
of which were successful.  Our proved reserves in Overton were 189 Bcfe at
year-end 2009, compared to 273 Bcfe at year-end 2008 and 315 Bcfe at year-end
2007.  Net production from Overton was 14.6 Bcfe in 2009, compared to 19.9
Bcfe in 2008 and 25.1 Bcfe in 2007. We expect our production and reserves from
Overton to continue to decline due to the planned lack of significant investment
in the field during 2010 and the natural production decline in existing
wells.

Our Angelina River Trend
properties, collectively referred to as Angelina, are concentrated in several
separate development areas located primarily in four counties in East Texas
targeting the Travis Peak, Haynesville Shale, James Lime, Pettet and Middle
Bossier formations. At December 31, 2009, we held approximately 95,200 gross
undeveloped acres and 40,200 gross developed acres at Angelina with an average
working interest of 65% and an average net revenue interest of 50%.  Our
acreage position was obtained at an average cost of approximately $241 per acre
and the undeveloped portion of our acreage has an average remaining lease term
of 2 years.  Our proved reserves in the Angelina area were 137 Bcfe at
year-end 2009, compared to 74 Bcfe at year-end 2008 and 33 Bcfe at year-end
2007.  Net production from our Angelina properties was 19.7 Bcfe in 2009,
compared to 11.3 Bcfe in 2008 and 2.5 Bcfe in 2007.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2009, we invested approximately $143 million to drill 44 wells
at Angelina, all of which were successful or in progress at December 31,
2009. 
Our 2009 drilling program was primarily focused on developing
the James Lime formation in our Jebel prospect area located in Shelby County,
Texas. We also successfully initiated drilling in the Haynesville Shale and
Middle Bossier in Shelby and San Augustine Counties with the first horizontal
well, the Red River 877 #1 located in Shelby County, production testing at 7.2
MMcf per day in the first quarter of 2009. We drilled four additional wells in
the Haynesville Shale formation which production tested at 13.4 MMcf per day,
16.7 MMcf per day, 21.0 MMcf per day and 18.1 MMcf per day. Additionally, we
completed our first well in the Middle Bossier formation which production tested
at 11.3 MMcf per day. In total, we have approximately 42,300 net acres we
believe are prospective for the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shales and our
average gross working interest is approximately 61%.

horizontal wells, 51 of which we operated, including 8 wells which were in
progress.  Of those, 43 wells that we operated were placed on production at
an average gross initial production rate of 9.8 MMcfe per day, resulting in net
production from the James Lime of approximately 48 MMcf per day at December 31,
2009.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"

participate in approximately 50 to 60 gross wells in East Texas, 22 to 27 of
which will be operated.  Of the wells planned in 2010, 21 to 26 wells will
be targeting the Haynesville or Middle Bossier Shales and 29 to 34 will target
the James Lime, Pettet or Cotton Valley formations.
Conventional Arkoma
Basin.  We have traditionally operated in a portion of the Arkoma
Basin located in western Arkansas that we refer to as the “Fairway.”  In
recent years, we have expanded our activity in the Arkoma Basin to the south and
east of the traditional Fairway area, primarily in the Ranger Anticline and
Midway areas.  We refer to our drilling program targeting stratigraphic
Atokan-age objectives in Oklahoma and Arkansas as the “conventional Arkoma”
drilling program.  

At December 31, 2009, we
had approximately 208 Bcf of reserves that were attributable to our conventional
Arkoma properties, representing approximately 6% of our total reserves, compared
to 281 Bcf at year-end 2008 and 304 Bcf at year-end 2007.  Our proved
reserves have declined over the past three years primarily due to lower capital

investments in the area which were not
sufficient to offset our annual field production and downward revisions due to
comparative decreases in gas prices and negative performance revisions.  In
2009, we invested approximately $40 million in our conventional Arkoma drilling
program and participated in 20 wells, of which 15 were successful and 3 were in
progress at year-end, resulting in an 88% success rate and adding new reserves
of 14 Bcf.  This area recorded net downward revisions of approximately 64
Bcf primarily due to a comparative decrease in the average 2009 price from the
year-end 2008 gas price and negative performance revisions. Net production from
our conventional Arkoma properties was 22.0 Bcf in 2009, compared to 24.4 Bcf in
2008 and 23.8 Bcf in 2007.  Production decreased during 2009 primarily due
to significantly lower capital investments in the area as compared to 2008
levels, while production increased in 2008 from 2007 as new production stemming
from our 2008 drilling program more than offset the natural production decline
from existing wells.  

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"

Pennsylvania in 2007 in an effort to gain a position in the emerging Marcellus
Shale play.  At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 149,317 net acres
in Pennsylvania under which we believe the Marcellus Shale is prospective.
 Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2009 had an average
remaining lease term of 5 years, an average royalty interest of 13% and was
obtained at an average cost of approximately $594 per acre.  During 2009,
we invested approximately $40 million in Pennsylvania, almost all of which was
for acquisition of properties, including approximately 22,829 net acres in
Lycoming County that was purchased for approximately $8.7 million, or $382 per
acre. In 2008, we invested approximately $58 million in the Marcellus Shale play
in Pennsylvania and drilled our first four wells (three vertical and one
horizontal) on our acreage in Bradford and Susquehanna Counties, three of which
have been production tested.  In 2007, we invested approximately $17.5

New
Ventures
We actively seek to find
and develop new oil and gas plays with significant exploration and exploitation
potential, which we refer to as “New Ventures.” We have been focusing on
unconventional plays (including coalbed methane, shale gas and basin-centered
gas) as well as determining the technological methods best suited to developing
these plays, such as horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation techniques.
New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on repeatability, multi-well
potential and land availability as well as other criteria and may be located
both inside and outside of the United States.  At December 31, 2009, we
held 36,125 net undeveloped acres in the United States outside of our core
operating areas in connection with New Ventures prospects.  This compares
to 138,638 and 156,465 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2008 and 2007,
respectively, of which 114,738 and 88,000 net undeveloped acres, respectively,
were in Pennsylvania where we are targeting the Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus
Shale acreage was transferred to our U.S. Exploitation group in 2009 and is
discussed in more detail in the paragraphs above. 

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2009, we invested approximately $25 million in our New Ventures

invested during 2008 and 2007, approximately $58 million and $17.5 million,
respectively, were invested in the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania.
 In 2010, we plan to invest approximately $135 million in various
unconventional, exploration and New Ventures projects.

Capital
Investments
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>During 2009, we invested a total of $1.6 billion in our E&P
business and participated in drilling 636 wells, 419 of which were successful, 5
were dry and 212 were in progress at year-end.  Of the 212 wells in
progress at year-end, 196 were located in our Fayetteville Shale play.  Our
investments focused primarily on our active drilling programs in the
Fayetteville Shale play, East Texas, Appalachia and the conventional Arkoma
Basin, which accounted for 82%, 11%, 3% and 3% of our E&P capital
investments in 2009, respectively.  We invested approximately $1.3 billion
in our Fayetteville Shale play, $167 million in East Texas, $40 million in
Appalachia, $40 million in our conventional Arkoma Basin program and $25 million
in New Ventures projects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Of the $1.6 billion invested in 2009, approximately $1.3 billion
was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $82 million
for acquisition of properties, $32 million for seismic expenditures and $155
million in capitalized interest and expenses and other technology-related
expenditures.  Additionally, we invested approximately $35 million in our
sand facility and drilling rig related and ancillary equipment.  In 2008,
we invested approximately $1.6 billion in our primary E&P business
activities and participated in drilling 750 wells. Of the $1.6 billion invested
in 2008, approximately $1.3 billion was invested in exploratory and development
drilling and workovers, $83 million for acquisition of properties, $66 million
for seismic expenditures and $118 million in capitalized interest and expenses
and other technology-related expenditures. Additionally, we invested
approximately $36 million in drilling rig related and ancillary equipment.
 In 2007, we invested approximately $1.4 billion in our primary E&P
business activities and participated in drilling 653 wells. Of the $1.4 billion
invested in 2007, approximately $1.1 billion was invested in exploratory and
development drilling and workovers, $68 million for acquisition of properties,
$100 million for seismic expenditures and $77 million in capitalized interest
and expenses and other technology-related expenditures.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2010, we plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion in our
E&P program and participate in drilling 750 to 800 gross wells, 520 to 555
of which are planned to be operated by us.  The Fayetteville Shale play
will be the primary focus of our capital investments, with planned investments
of approximately $1.2 billion.  Our planned 2010 capital investments also
include approximately $230 million in East Texas, $145 million in Appalachia,
$135 million in unconventional, exploration and New Ventures projects, $25
million in our conventional drilling program in the Arkoma Basin and $15 million
for other E&P projects.

Other
Revenues
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Other revenues and operating income for 2009 included gains of
approximately $3.4 million related to the sale of gas-in-storage inventory and
charges totaling $6.1 million primarily related to a $4.3 million non-cash
impairment to reduce the current portion of our natural gas inventory to the
lower of cost or market.  Other revenues and operating income for 2008 and
2007 included gains of approximately $4.8 million and $6.4 million,
respectively, related to the sale of gas-in-storage inventory.
Sales, Delivery
Commitments and Customers
Sales. Our
daily natural gas equivalent production averaged 823.1 MMcfe in 2009, compared
to 533.1 MMcfe in 2008 and 311.1 MMcfe in 2007.  Total natural gas
equivalent production was 300.4 Bcfe in 2009, up from 194.6 Bcfe in 2008 and
113.6 Bcfe in 2007.  Our natural gas production was
299.7 Bcf in 2009, compared to 192.3 Bcf in 2008 and 109.9 Bcf in 2007.
 The increase in production in 2009 resulted primarily from a 109.0 Bcf
increase in production from the Fayetteville Shale play and an increase in our
East Texas production, which more than offset a combined decrease in net
production arising from decreased production from our Arkoma and other
properties and the sale of our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast properties in 2008.
 The increase in production in 2008 resulted primarily
from an 81.0 Bcf increase in

production from the Fayetteville Shale play which combined with increases in
our East Texas and Arkoma production to more than offset the decreases resulting
from the oil and gas properties sold during 2008.  We also produced 124,000
barrels of oil in 2009, compared to 385,000 barrels of oil in 2008 and 614,000
barrels of oil in 2007.  Our oil production decreased during 2009 and 2008
primarily due to the sale of our Permian and Gulf Coast properties in 2008.
 For 2010, we are targeting total natural gas and crude oil production of
approximately 400 to 410 Bcfe, which represents a growth rate of approximately
35% over our 2009 production volumes.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Sales of gas and oil production are conducted under contracts that
reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. We are unable
to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including
changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our
production. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial
arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude
oil production in order to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to
minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit
speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with
appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2009, we had hedges in place on 66
Bcf, or approximately 16% of our targeted 2010 gas production, and 30 Bcf of our
expected 2011 gas production. We intend to hedge additional future production
volumes to the extent natural gas prices rise to levels that we believe will
achieve certain desired levels of cash flow.  We refer you to Item 7A of
this Form 10-K, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,”
for further information regarding our hedge position at December 31, 2009.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Including the effect of hedges, we realized an average wellhead
price of $5.30 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2009, compared to $7.52
per Mcf in 2008 and $6.80 per Mcf in 2007.  Our hedging activities
increased our average gas price $1.96 per Mcf in 2009, decreased our average
price $0.21 per Mcf in 2008 and increased our average price $0.64 per Mcf in
2007.  Our average oil price realized was $54.99 per barrel in 2009,
compared to $107.18 per barrel in 2008 and $69.12 per barrel in 2007.  None
of our crude oil production was hedged during 2009, 2008 or 2007.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In recent years, locational differences in market prices for
natural gas have been wider than historically experienced.  Disregarding
the impact of hedges, from 2005 through 2007, the average price received for our
gas production was approximately $0.50 to $1.00 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX
spot market prices primarily due to the locational market differentials.
However, during 2009 and 2008, widening market differentials caused the
difference in our annual average price received for our gas production to range
from approximately $0.65 to $1.30 per Mcf lower than market prices.  The
discount was at its highest in late 2008, due to increased production in the
Fayetteville Shale for which there was not sufficient transportation to other
markets as a result of the delay in the completion of the Boardwalk Pipeline.
Since the completion of the Boardwalk Pipeline, the locational differences in
the market prices for our gas production has narrowed.  Assuming a NYMEX
commodity price for 2010 of $5.00 per Mcf of gas, the average price received for
our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.20 per Mcf below
the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. Our
E&P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to
NYMEX spot prices due to locational basis differentials, while transportation
charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received.  In 2010, we
expect to pay average third-party transportation charges in
the range of $0.25 to $0.32 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the
range of 0.25% to 1.00% of our sales price for natural gas.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Delivery Commitments. As of February 1, 2010, we had
natural gas delivery commitments of 134 Bcf in 2010 and 38 Bcf in 2011 under
existing agreements.  These commitments require the delivery of natural gas
in Arkansas and Texas.   These amounts are well below our forecasted
2010 and anticipated 2011 production from our available reserves in our
Fayetteville Shale and East Texas operations, which are not subject to any
priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers
or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state
regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our
ability to meet our contractual obligations other than those discussed in Item
1A. “Risk Factors”.  We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term
or long-term contractual obligations from available reserves from our own
production, however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase gas at
market to fulfill our obligations. We may have to borrow funds to pay for these
gas purchases and if we are unable to do so, our earnings could be adversely
affected. 
Customers. Our customers
include major and small energy companies, utilities and industrial consumers of
natural gas. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, no single
third-party customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.

Impact of Federal Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas
and Oil
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has
been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC.  In 1989, Congress
enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act.  The
Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting
wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers
of natural gas can be made at uncontrolled market prices.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated
and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and
judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the
natural gas industry.  There can be no assurance that the less stringent
regulatory approach pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. We refer you
to “Other Items — Environmental Matters” and the risk factor “We incur
substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations
relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the
future” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of
government regulation on our natural gas distribution business.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Competition
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>All phases of the oil and gas industry are highly competitive.
 We compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and
development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil and the
securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.  Our
competitors include major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas
companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these
competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those
available to us. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Competition in Arkansas has increased in recent years due largely
to the development of improved access to interstate pipelines and our discovery
of the Fayetteville Shale play. While improved intrastate and interstate
pipeline transportation in Arkansas should increase our access to markets for
our gas production, these markets will also be served by a number of other
suppliers.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect
both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. Outside Arkansas, we
are less established and face competition from a larger number of other
producers.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Commencing in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders
(collectively, “Order No. 636”), which require interstate pipelines to provide
transportation separately, or “unbundled,” from the pipelines’ sales of gas.
 Order No. 636 also requires pipelines to provide open-access
transportation on a basis that is equal for all shippers.  Although Order
No. 636 does not directly regulate our activities, the FERC has stated that it
intends for Order No. 636 to foster increased competition within all phases of
the natural gas industry.  Starting in 2000, the FERC issued a series of
orders (collectively, “Order No. 637”), which imposed a number of additional
reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  Among
other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period, and effected
changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity
segmentation, pipeline penalties, rights of first refusal and information
reporting.  The implementation of these orders has not had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations to date. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms
initiated by the FERC or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of
increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing
transparency in markets in which our natural gas is sold.  However, we do
not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other
natural gas producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other
legislative body. 
Midstream
Services
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our Midstream Services segment is well-positioned to complement
our E&P initiatives and to compete with other midstream providers for
unaffiliated business. Our midstream assets support our E&P operations and
are currently concentrated in our Fayetteville Shale play. We generate revenue
from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market
and through the marketing of natural gas.  
Our operating income
from this segment was $122.6 million on revenues of $1.6 billion in 2009,
compared to $62.3 million on revenues of $2.2 billion in 2008 and $13.2 million
on revenues of $962.0 million in 2007.  Revenues decreased in 2009 as
increased gathering revenues and increased volumes marketed were more than
offset by considerably lower gas prices.  The increase in revenue in 2008
was largely attributable to increased gathering revenues, increased volumes
marketed and higher gas prices.  EBITDA generated by
our Midstream Services segment was $141.9 million in

2009, compared to $73.9 million in 2008 and $18.8 million in 2007.  The
increases in 2009 and 2008 operating income and EBITDA were primarily due to
increased gathering revenues and marketing margins, partially offset by
increased operating costs and expenses.  We expect that the operating
income and EBITDA of our Midstream Services segment will increase significantly
over the next few years as we continue to develop our Fayetteville Shale
acreage.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to “Business —
Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this
Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss)
attributable to Southwestern Energy.  
Gas Gathering
We engage in gas
gathering activities through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering and
Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering engages in gathering activities in Arkansas
primarily related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play.  In
2009, we invested approximately $214.2 million related to these activities and
had gathering revenues of $205.6 million, compared to $183.0 million invested
and revenues of $114.9 million in 2008 and $107.4 million invested and $37.7
million in revenues in 2007.  

DeSoto Gathering is
rapidly expanding its network of gathering pipelines and facilities throughout
the Fayetteville Shale play area. During 2009, DeSoto Gathering gathered
approximately 367.3 Bcf of gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area,
including 26.9 Bcf of third-party natural gas.  During 2008, DeSoto
Gathering gathered approximately 208.3 Bcf of gas volumes in the Fayetteville
Shale play area, including 23.8 Bcf of third-party natural gas. In 2007, DeSoto
Gathering gathered approximately 78.7 Bcf of gas volumes in the Fayetteville
Shale play area, including 7.6 Bcf of third-party natural gas.  The
increase in volumes gathered in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to our
growing production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play.  At the end of
2009, DeSoto Gathering had approximately 1,137 miles of pipe from the individual
wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment had been installed
at 48 central point gathering facilities in the field. Angelina Gathering
currently engages in gathering activities in East Texas in connection with our
Angelina properties.  Angelina Gathering provides gathering support for all
of our E&P operations outside of Arkansas.  At year-end 2009, Angelina
Gathering had approximately 21 miles of pipeline in Texas.  Our gathering
revenues are expected to grow substantially over the next few years largely as a
result of increased development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and the
increased development activity undertaken by other operators in the play
area.

Gas
Marketing
Our gas marketing
subsidiary, SES, allows us to capture downstream opportunities related to
marketing and transportation of natural gas. SES purchases gas production and
sells it to end-users and manages the basis and marketing portfolio and acquires
transportation rights on pipelines.  Our current marketing operations
primarily relate to the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party
natural gas.  During 2009, we marketed 382.5 Bcf of natural gas, compared
to 258.0 Bcf in 2008 and 145.7 Bcf in 2007.  Of the total volumes marketed,
production from our E&P operated wells accounted for 92% in 2009, compared
to 96% in 2008 and 89% in 2007.

In 2008 and 2006, SES
became a “foundation shipper” on two pipeline projects serving the Fayetteville
Shale play in anticipation of significant growth in the future production
volumes from our operations in the play. In 2008, Fayetteville Express Pipeline
LLC, or FEP, which is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and
Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., agreed to construct a pipeline with an estimated
ultimate capacity of up to 2.0 Bcf per day that will provide our operations in
the Fayetteville Shale play with access to midwestern and eastern markets.
 The application for the pipeline was approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, in December 2009, and it is expected to be
in-service by late 2010 or early 2011.  SES has a maximum aggregate
commitment of 1,200,000 Dekatherms per day for an initial term of ten years from
the in-service date. The other project, which began in 2006 and consists of two
pipeline laterals called the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, has already
been constructed by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC, or Texas Gas, a subsidiary of
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. SES has maximum aggregate commitments of
800,000 MMBtu per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 MMBtu per day on
the Greenville Lateral. 
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>On April 1, 2009, Texas Gas placed in service the Fayetteville and
the Greenville laterals and subsequently reduced the capacity on, or shut down,
both laterals on several occasions due to various activities, including
maintenance and pipeline inspection.  As a result, we curtailed a portion
of our natural gas production during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 as
Texas Gas remediated pipe anomalies pursuant to protocol agreed with the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA.  On
October 8, 2009, Texas Gas announced it received authorization from the PHMSA to
operate the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals at standard operating pressures
with a capacity of 805,000 MMBtu per day, which is less than the total capacity
anticipated under the firm transportation and resulted in a reduction in the
capacity to which we are entitled.  Texas Gas is continuing to perform the
testing protocol required by PHMSA and, once that testing has been completed and
the results known, expects to request from PHMSA the authority to operate
the

Fayetteville Lateral at higher than normal operating pressures under a
special permit. In January 2010, Texas Gas added compression facilities that
increased peak-day delivery capacity to approximately 1.0 Bcf per day on the
Greenville Lateral and approximately 1.1 Bcf per day on the Fayetteville
Lateral. The designed peakday delivery capacity of the Fayetteville Lateral is
approximately 1.3 Bcf per day once the authority to operate it at higher than
normal operating pressures is received from PHMSA or Texas Gas completes other
system upgrades on that project. The increase in capacity to 1.3 Bcf per day
will be needed in order for Texas Gas to meet its contractual commitments that
will be in effect in mid-2011.   
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Prior to the commencement of service on the Fayetteville and
Greenville Laterals, the majority of our gas from the Arkoma Basin was moved to
markets in the Midwest and was sold primarily based on two indices, “NGPL TexOk”
and “Centerpoint East.”  The Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals allow us
to transport our gas to markets in the eastern United States and interconnect
with Texas Gas Zone 1, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 100, Trunkline Zone 1A, ANR,
Tennessee Gas Pipeline 800, Columbia Gulf Mainline, TETCO M1 30" and Sonat price
indices.  We rely in part upon the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals to
service our increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play.  There
can be no assurance that the amount of gas being produced in the Fayetteville
Shale will not exceed the available capacity of the various intrastate or
interstate transportation pipelines.  Our projections, financial condition,
results of operation and planned capital expenditures could be adversely
impacted by lack of available capacity and continued capacity reductions,
shutdowns or other curtailments of the laterals or other pipelines.

align=justify>Competition
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our gas gathering and marketing activities compete with numerous
other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger
financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are
other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that
are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting
competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of
consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other
transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete
effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing
and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Regulation
On March 15, 2006, the
United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, issued new rules pertaining
to certain gathering lines. Compliance with the new rules has not had a material
adverse impact on our operations. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental
Matters” and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with
government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental
protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on
our Midstream Services business.

On November 20, 2008,
the FERC issued a Final Rule in Order No. 720, which requires, in relevant part,
major non-interstate natural gas pipelines to post, on a daily basis, specific
scheduled flow information at each receipt or delivery point with a design
capacity of 15,000 MMBtu per day or more. A “major non-interstate pipeline” is a
pipeline that is not classified as a natural gas company under the NGA and
delivers on average more than 50 million MMBtu of gas annually over a three year
period.  Our gathering system in Arkansas constitutes a “major
non-interstate pipeline” under Order No. 720 and will be required to comply with
the requirements of Order No. 720 once they become effective for major
non-interstate pipelines.  On December 11, 2008, the American Gas
Association filed a Motion for an Extension of Time to Comply with Order No. 720
arguing that some major non-interstate pipelines will need additional time in
which to determine which receipt and delivery points are subject to the posting
requirements, obtain corporate approval for expenditures needed for compliance
and develop internet posting systems. On January 15, 2009, FERC granted an
extension of time for major non-interstate pipelines to comply with the
requirements of Order No. 720 until 150 days following the issuance of an order
addressing the pending requests for rehearing and such an order was issued on
January 21, 2010.  We believe that we will be able to comply with the
requirements of Order No. 720 within the prescribed 150 days.

Natural Gas
Distribution
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Effective July 1, 2008, we sold all of the capital stock of
Arkansas Western Gas for $223.5 million (net of expenses related to the sale).
In order to receive regulatory approval for the sale and certain related
transactions, we paid $9.8 million to Arkansas Western Gas for the benefit of
its customers.  We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $57.3 million in
the third quarter of 2008.  As a result of the sale of the utility, we are
no longer engaged in natural gas distribution operations.  Arkansas Western
Gas provided operating income for the first half of 2008 of $10.7 million,
compared to $10.0 million for the entire year of 2007.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion
and amortization.  We have included information concerning EBITDA in this
Form 10-K because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of
a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure
commonly used in our industry.  EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow
data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, or GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.
 EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
of other companies.
We believe that net
income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy is the financial measure
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly
comparable to EBITDA as defined.  The following table reconciles
EBITDA, as defined, with net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy for the years-ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

align=justify>Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local
laws and regulations including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, or the CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean
Air Act and similar state statutes.  These laws and regulations require
permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements in order
to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing and location of wells,
the method of drilling

and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which
wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, the prevention and
cleanup of pollutants and other matters.  We maintain insurance against
costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such
risks.  Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have
a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there
can be no assurance that future <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt"
face=Arial>developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental
laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental
liabilities or costs. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result
in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties
and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Changes in environmental
laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more
stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal
or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations
and financial position, as well as those in the natural gas and oil
industry in general.  Although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that
continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material
adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that this trend will
continue in the future.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations
thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties”
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting
from such spills in United States’ waters.  A “responsible party”
includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel,
or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is
located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil
cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  While
liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage
of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful
misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or
operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate
fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses
exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on
a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans
and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and
restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a
“hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and
companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal
of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were
responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to
joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to
natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or the
RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and
production of natural gas and oil.  The RCRA specifically excludes from the
definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural
gas or geothermal energy.”  However, legislation has been proposed in
Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil
exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the
reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and
clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a
significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and
oil industry in general.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as
paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated
as hazardous waste. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased,
onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated
with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  Although
we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the
industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed
of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under
other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In
addition, a portion of these properties have been operated by third parties
whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our
control.  These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be
subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and analogous state laws.
 Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate
previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by
prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater
contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial
plugging or closure operations to prevent future
contamination.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA,
imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of
produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters.
 Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to
conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and
similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties
for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges
of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state
discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System general permits issued by the Environmental Protection
Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand,
drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt"
face=Arial>other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry
into coastal waters.  Although the costs to comply with zero discharge
mandates under federal or state law may be significant, the entire industry
is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs
will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or
financial position. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain
natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits
for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of
wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention
plans. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operation as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  The knowledge and
expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our operations in
the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other operating areas,
including our Marcellus Shale acreage.  In our Fayetteville Shale play, the
fracturing fluids we use are comprised of over 99% water, with small quantities
of additives containing compounds such as hydrochloric acid, mineral oil, citric
acid and biocide. Many of these additives can be found in common consumer and
household products.  The fracturing fluid is combined with sand and
injected under high pressure into the target formation. As the mixture is forced
into the formation, the pressure causes the rock to fracture and the sand
remains behind to prop open the fractures. These fractures create a pathway for
the gas to flow out of the formation and into the wellbore. A 2004 study
conducted by the EPA found that certain hydraulic fracturing posed no risk to
drinking water and Congress exempted hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking
Water Act, or SDWA. Recently, there has been a heightened debate over whether
the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing may contaminate drinking water supply
and proposals have been made to revisit the environmental exemption for
hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or to enact separate federal legislation or
legislation at the state and local government levels that would regulate
hydraulic fracturing. Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate
are considering Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act
bills and a number of states, including states in which we have operations, are
looking to more closely regulate hydraulic fracturing due to concerns about
water supply. The recent congressional legislative efforts seek to regulate
hydraulic fracturing to Underground Injection Control program requirements,
which would significantly increase well capital costs. We are actively exploring
and/or testing new alternatives for certain of the compounds we use in our
additives but there can be no assurance that these alternatives will be
effective at the volumes and rates we require.  If the exemption for
hydraulic fracturing is removed from the SDWA, or if the FRAC Act or other
legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level, any restrictions on
the use of hydraulic fracturing contained in any such legislation could have a
significant impact on our financial condition and results of operation.

“Field” An
area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or
related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or
stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are
separated vertically by intervening impervious, strata, or laterally by local
geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in
overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational
field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic
condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed
to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest,

date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the
hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Also referred to as
“proved reserves.” For additional information, see the SEC’s definition in Rule
4-10(a) (22) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC’s

and oil reserves, PV-10 means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated
from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future
development costs, using prices and costs in effect as of the date of the report
or estimate, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as
general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense
or to depreciation, depletion and amortization, discounted using an annual
discount rate of 10%.  Also referred to as “present value.” After-tax PV-10
is also referred to as “standardized measure” and is net of future income tax
expense.
“Reserve life
index”  The quotient resulting from dividing total reserves by annual
production and typically expressed in years. 
“Reserve
replacement ratio”  The sum of the estimated net proved reserves added
through discoveries, extensions, infill drilling and acquisitions (which may
include or exclude reserve revisions of previous estimates) for a specified
period of time divided by production for that same period of time.

“Unconventional
play” A term used in the natural gas and oil industry to refer to a play in
which the targeted reservoirs generally fall into one of three categories: (1)
tight sands, (2) coal beds, or (3) gas shales. The reservoirs tend to cover
large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete
hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs.
These reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other
special recovery processes in order to produce economic flow rates.
“Undeveloped
acreage” Those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or
completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of
oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. For
additional information, see the SEC's definition in Item 1208(c)(4) of
Regulation S-K, a link for which is available at the SEC's website,
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.
“Undeveloped
oil and gas reserves” Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves
of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required
for recompletion. Also referred to as “undeveloped reserves.” For additional
information, see the SEC’s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (31) of Regulation S-X, a
link for which is available at the SEC’s website,
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.
“Undeveloped
reserves” See “undeveloped oil and gas reserves.”
 “Well
spacing” The regulation of the number and location of wells over an oil or
gas reservoir, as a conservation measure.  Well spacing is normally
accomplished by order of the regulatory conservation commission in the
applicable jurisdiction.  The order may be statewide in its application
(subject to change for local conditions) or it may be entered for each field
after its discovery. In the operational context, “well spacing” refers to the
area attributable between producing wells within the scope of what is permitted
under a regulatory order.
“Working
interest” An operating interest that gives the owner the right to
drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and to receive a
share of production.
“Workovers”
 Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
“WTI”
 West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil in the United
States.

Texas which may widen due to pipeline or other constraints. Price volatility
makes it difficult to project the return on exploration and development projects
involving our natural gas and oil properties and to estimate with precision the
value of producing properties that we may own or propose to acquire.  In
addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for natural gas and
oil properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the
purchase price of properties.  Our results of operations may fluctuate
significantly as a result of, among other things, variations in natural gas and
oil prices and production performance.  In recent years, natural gas and

Lower natural gas and oil prices and/or
increased development costs may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs.
 

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We use the full cost method of accounting for our natural gas and
oil operations.  Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore
for and develop natural gas and oil properties.  Under the full cost
accounting rules of the SEC, the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil
properties – net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
deferred income taxes – may not exceed a “ceiling limit.”  This is equal to
the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and
oil reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of
unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax
effects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>These rules generally require pricing future natural gas and oil
production at the unescalated natural gas and oil prices in effect at the end of
each fiscal quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow
hedges, utilizing the average price in the 12-month period prior to December 31,
2009, defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by
contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
They also require a write-down if the ceiling limit is exceeded, even if prices
declined for only a relatively short period of time.  Once a write-down is
taken, it cannot be reversed in future periods even if natural gas and oil
prices increase. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In the period ended March 31, 2009, we incurred a ceiling test
write-down of $907.8 million which resulted in an operating loss for our company
for 2009. If natural gas and oil prices decline below levels utilized in our
ceiling limit test at December 31, 2009 and/or development costs increase, a
write-down may occur, which would adversely impact our results of operation and
financial condition.
We may have
difficulty financing our planned capital investments, which could adversely
affect our growth.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 46px"
align=justify>We have experienced and expect to continue to experience
substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs as a result of our
drilling program. Our planned capital investments for 2010 are expected to
significantly exceed the net cash generated by our operations.  We expect
to borrow under our credit facility to fund capital investments that are in
excess of our net cash flow and cash on hand.  Our ability to borrow under
our credit facility is subject to certain conditions.  At December 31,
2009, we were in compliance with the borrowing conditions of our credit
facility.  If we are not in compliance with the terms of our credit
facility in the future or if the lenders under our credit facility are unable to
fulfill their commitments, we may not be able to borrow under the facility to
fund our capital investments.  We also cannot be certain that other
financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  In the
event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling,
development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an
untimely or unfavorable basis.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a
material adverse effect on our results and future operations.
Working
interest owners of some of our properties may be unwilling or unable to cover
their portion of development costs, which could change our exploration and
development plans.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Some of our working interest owners may have difficulties
obtaining the capital needed to finance their activities, or may believe that
estimated drilling and completion costs are excessive. As a result, these
working interest owners may choose not to participate in certain wells or be
unable or unwilling to pay their share of well costs as they become due. These
actions could cause us to change our development plans for the affected
properties.
Although our
estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our
estimates may still prove to be inaccurate.
Our reserve data
represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision
of our management.  Our reserve estimates are audited each year by
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum
engineering firm.  In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of
NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve
estimates.  NSAI’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which
includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately
88% of the present worth of our total proved reserves.  NSAI’s audit
process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and
selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected
fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The
properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are the lowest value
properties and are not reviewed in the audit.  The fields included in
approximately the top 88% present value as of December 31, 2009 accounted for
approximately 90% of our total proved reserves and approximately 97% of our
proved undeveloped reserves.  In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not
independently verify the data that we provided to them with respect to ownership
interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of
operations and development, product prices, or any

audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity
or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such
information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating
thereto or had independently verified such information or data. The estimates of
NSAI may differ significantly on an individual property basis from our

 Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the

is assigned.  The reservoir engineering and financial data included in
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset
management teams and by our Vice President-Economic Planning and Acquisitions
who is the technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our
reserve estimates, and has over twenty years of experience in petroleum
engineering, including over fifteen years in estimating oil and gas reserves. On
our behalf, the Vice President-Economic Planning and Acquisitions engages NSAI,
a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial
organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved
reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. The financial data
included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting
staff.  Our proved reserve estimates, as internally reviewed and
audited by NSAI, are submitted for review and approval to our
Chief Executive Officer.  Finally, upon his approval, NSAI reports the
results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors and final authority over
the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. We
incorporate many factors and assumptions into our estimates including:

future development and
operating costs.

Although we believe our
assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time
we prepare our estimates, our actual results could vary considerably from
estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves (in the aggregate
and for a particular geographic location), production, revenues, taxes and
development and operating expenditures.  In addition, our estimates of
reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production
history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing natural gas
and oil prices, severance taxes, operating and development costs and other
factors.  In 2009, our reserves were revised upward by 92.9 Bcfe, primarily
due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties, partially
offset by downward revisions due to a comparative decrease in the average 2009
price from the year-end 2008 gas price.  In 2008, our reserves were revised
upward by 98.1 Bcfe, primarily due to improved performance in our Fayetteville
Shale properties, partially offset by downward revisions due to lower year-end
oil and gas prices combined with the performance revisions in some of our East
Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin properties. In 2007, our reserves were
revised upward by 31.0 Bcfe, primarily due to improved performance in our
Fayetteville Shale properties, which was partially offset by a downward revision
in our Overton properties.  These revisions represented no greater than 5%
of our total reserve estimates in each of these years, which we believe is
indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.  Because we
review our reserve projections for every property at the end of every year, any
material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent reserve
reports.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Finally, recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires
significant capital investments and successful drilling operations.  At
December 31, 2009, approximately 1,677 Bcfe of our estimated proved reserves
were undeveloped.  Our reserve data assume that we can and will make these
expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur.

and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking
Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for additional information
regarding the uncertainty of reserve estimates.

Our drilling

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, we had drilled and completed 1,288 wells
relating to our Fayetteville Shale play.  At year-end 2009, approximately
48% of our leasehold acreage was held by production, excluding our acreage in
the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin. Our drilling plans with
respect to our Fayetteville Shale play are flexible and are dependent upon a
number of factors, including the extent to which we can replicate the results of

If we fail to
drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our Fayetteville Shale
acreage, the initial lease terms could expire, which would result in the loss of
certain leasehold rights.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Approximately 178,930 net acres of our Fayetteville Shale acreage
will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to
develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases.  As
discussed above under “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are
subject to change,” our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors,
including certain factors that are beyond our control.  The number of wells
we will be required to drill to retain our leasehold rights will be determined
by field rules established by the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, or the AOGC.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2006, the AOGC approved field rules in the Fayetteville Shale,
the Moorefield Shale and the Chattanooga Shale as “unconventional sources of
supply.”  Under the rules, each drilling unit would consist of a
governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators would be permitted
to drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of
supply.  However, current rules are subject to change and could impair our
ability to drill or maintain our acreage position.  To the extent that any
field rules prevent us from successfully drilling wells in certain areas, we may
not be able to drill the wells required to maintain our leasehold rights for
certain of our Fayetteville Shale acreage.
If our
Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a significant supply of
natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost and
our commitments for transportation on pipelines could make the sale of our gas
uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, we had invested approximately $548.9
million in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale
play.  We intend to continue to make substantial investments in the
expansion of our gas gathering system as we further develop the play.  Our
gas gathering business will largely rely on gas sourced in our Fayetteville
Shale play area in Arkansas.  In addition, we have entered into 10-year
firm transportation agreements committing us to transportation on the
Fayetteville and Greenville laterals recently built by Texas Gas to service the
Fayetteville Shale play

area as well as the pipeline being constructed by Fayetteville
Express Pipeline LLC, which is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners,
L.P. Our marketing subsidiary has also entered into multiple other firm
transportation agreements relating to gas volumes from our Fayetteville Shale
play. As of December 31, 2009, our aggregate demand charge commitments under
these firm transportation agreements were approximately $1.8 billion. If our
Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a significant supply of
natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost, and
we could be forced to pay demand charges for transportation on pipelines that we
would not be using.  These events could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our
exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may
not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage in
order to further our development efforts.  Exploration, development,
drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk
that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered.  We invest
in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result
in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot assure you that
all prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our
initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that leasehold
acreage acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by
us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or
any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells.  Drilling
for natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry
wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net
reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.
 In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate
of return.  Our ability to achieve our target PVI results are dependent
upon the current and future market prices for natural gas and crude oil, costs
associated with producing natural gas and crude oil and our ability to add
reserves at an acceptable cost.  We rely to a significant extent on seismic
data and other advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects
and in conducting our exploration activities.  The seismic data and other
technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of
leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether natural gas or oil is present or
may be produced economically.  The use of seismic data and other
technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional
drilling strategies.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In addition, we may not be successful in implementing our business
strategy of controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order
to improve our overall return.  The cost of drilling, completing and
operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the
economics of a project.  Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed,
delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including unexpected
drilling conditions, title problems, pressure or irregularities in formations,
equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, environmental and
other governmental requirements and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.
We incur
substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations
relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the
future.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our exploration, production, development and gas gathering and
marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local
levels.  We have made and will continue to make large expenditures in our
efforts to comply with these regulations, including environmental regulation.
The natural gas and oil regulatory environment could change in ways that might
substantially increase these costs.  Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate
conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights.  These
regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons we may
produce and sell.  In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the FERC
regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the NGA.  Other
regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of
royalty payments.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>As an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and oil
properties, and an owner of gas gathering systems, we are subject to various
federal, state and local regulations relating to discharge of materials into,
and protection of, the environment.  These regulations may, among other
things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from
operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require
suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Changes in or
additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could
significantly increase our costs of compliance, or otherwise adversely affect
our business.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"

Our
financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if the
exemption for hydraulic fracturing is removed from the Safe Drinking Water Act,
or if legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level regulating
hydraulic fracturing. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operation as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  The knowledge and
expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our operations in
the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other operating areas,
including our Marcellus Shale acreage.  In our Fayetteville Shale play, the
fracturing fluids we use are comprised of over 99% water, with small quantities
of additives containing compounds such as hydrochloric acid, mineral oil, citric
acid and biocide. Many of these additives can be found in common consumer and
household products.  The fracturing fluid is combined with sand and
injected under high pressure into the target formation. As the mixture is forced
into the formation, the pressure causes the rock to fracture and the sand
remains behind to prop open the fractures. These fractures create a pathway for
the gas to flow out of the formation and into the wellbore. A 2004 study
conducted by the EPA found that certain hydraulic fracturing posed no risk to
drinking water and Congress exempted hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking
Water Act, or SDWA. Recently, there has been a heightened debate over whether
the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing may contaminate drinking water supply
and proposals have been made to revisit the environmental exemption for
hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or to enact separate federal legislation or
legislation at the state and local government levels that would regulate
hydraulic fracturing. Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate
are considering Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act
bills and a number of states, including states in which we have operations, are
looking to more closely regulate hydraulic fracturing due to concerns about
water supply. The recent congressional legislative efforts seek to regulate
hydraulic fracturing to Underground Injection Control program requirements,
which would significantly increase well capital costs. We are actively exploring
and/or testing new alternatives for certain of the compounds we use in our
additives but there can be no assurance that these alternatives will be
effective at the volumes and rates we require.  If the exemption for
hydraulic fracturing is removed from the SDWA, or if the FRAC Act or other
legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level, any restrictions on
the use of hydraulic fracturing contained in any such legislation could have a
significant impact on our financial condition and results of operation.
 
Natural gas and
oil drilling and producing operations involve various risks.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to
the operation and development of natural gas and oil properties, the drilling of
natural gas and oil wells and the sale of natural gas and oil, including but not
limited to encountering well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure,
fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural
gas, brine or well fluids, hydrocarbon drainage from adjacent third-party
production, release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental
hazards and risks and failure of counterparties to perform as agreed.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities
arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and
in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  However, our insurance does not
protect us against all operational risks.  For example, we do not maintain
business interruption insurance.  Additionally, pollution and environmental
risks generally are not fully insurable.  These risks could give rise to
significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a material adverse
effect upon our financial results.  
We cannot
control activities on properties we do not operate.  Failure to fund
capital investments may result in reduction or forfeiture of our interests in
some of our non-operated projects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We do not operate some of the properties in which we have an
interest and we have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for
these properties or their associated costs.  As of December 31, 2009,
approximately 6% of our gas and oil properties, based on the PV-10 value of our
proved developed producing reserves, were operated by other companies.  Our
dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects
and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could
materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital
in drilling or acquisition activities and our targeted production growth rate.
 The success and timing of drilling, development and exploitation
activities on properties operated by others depend on a number of factors that
are beyond our control, including the operator’s expertise and financial
resources, approval of other participants for drilling wells and utilization of
technology.

Our ability to
sell our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially harmed if we
fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our ability to bring natural gas and crude oil production to
market depends on a number of factors including the availability and proximity
of pipelines, gathering systems and processing facilities. In some of the areas
where we have operations, we deliver natural gas and crude oil through gathering
systems and pipelines that we do not own.  With respect to our Fayetteville
Shale production, we are relying on third parties to construct additional
interstate pipelines to increase our ability to bring our production to market.
Delays in the commencement of operations of the new pipelines, the
unavailability of the new pipelines or other facilities due to market
conditions, mechanical reasons or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our
results of operations and financial condition.  Any significant change
affecting these facilities or our failure to obtain access to existing or future
facilities on acceptable terms could restrict our ability to conduct normal
operations.
Delays in the
construction of the pipelines serving the Fayetteville Shale play or in the
receipt of regulatory approvals affecting the pipelines could result in capacity
constraints that may limit our ability to sell natural gas and/or receive
favorable prices for our gas. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>If drilling in the Fayetteville Shale continues to be successful,
the amount of gas being produced in the area from new wells, as well as gas
produced from existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various intrastate
or interstate transportation pipelines currently available.  We have
subscribed for capacity on the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals recently
built by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC, and the pipeline being constructed by
Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC which is expected to be in service in late
2010 or early 2011. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>On April 1, 2009, Texas Gas placed in service the entire
Fayetteville and Greenville laterals and subsequently reduced the capacity on,
or shut down, both laterals on several occasions due to various activities,
including maintenance and pipeline inspection.  As a result, we curtailed a
portion of our natural gas production during the third and fourth quarters of
2009 primarily due to the inspections, repairs and maintenance relating to the
remediation of pipe anomalies on the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals.
 The remediation of the pipe anomalies by Texas Gas was pursuant to an
agreement with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or
PHMSA, entered during the second quarter 2009, which defined the testing
protocol and remediation efforts that Texas Gas would need to complete in order
to return to normal operating pressures, and for the Fayetteville Lateral, to
operate at higher than normal operating pressures.  On October 8, 2009,
Texas Gas announced it received authorization from the PHMSA to operate the
Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals at standard operating pressures with a
capacity of 805,000 MMBtu per day.  Texas Gas is continuing to perform the
testing protocol required by PHMSA and, once that testing has been completed and
the results known, expects to request from PHMSA the authority to operate the
Fayetteville Lateral at higher than normal operating pressures under a special
permit.  In addition, Texas Gas plans to add compression in 2010 that will
increase peak-day delivery capacities to approximately 1.0 Bcf per day on the
Greenville Lateral, and assuming that the authority is received to operate the
Fayetteville Lateral at higher than normal operating pressures, increase
peak-day delivery capacities to approximately 1.3 Bcf per day on the
Fayetteville Lateral.  The compression for the Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals has been approved by the FERC.  PHMSA retains discretion as to
whether to grant, or to maintain in force, authority to operate a pipeline at
higher than normal operating pressures.  We cannot predict when or if the
Fayetteville Lateral will be able to operate at higher capacities.  In
addition, PHMSA mandated repairs in conjunction with obtaining the special
operating permit or any other substantial delay in obtaining the special
operating permit from PHMSA could result in future curtailments of our capacity.
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We rely upon the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals to service
our increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play and are relying upon
the FEP pipeline’s timely construction. There can be no assurance that the
amount of gas being produced in the Fayetteville Shale will not exceed the
available capacity of the various intrastate or interstate transportation
pipelines. Our projections, financial condition, results of operation and
planned capital expenditures could be adversely impacted by lack of available
capacity and continued capacity reductions, shutdowns or other curtailments of
the laterals or other pipelines. 
Shortages of
oilfield equipment, services, supplies, raw materials and qualified personnel
could adversely affect our results of operations.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill
wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and
other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate
significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing
periodic shortages. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for
equipment, services, personnel and raw materials (such as sand, cement,
manufactured proppants and other materials utilized in the provision of the
oilfield services).  Higher natural gas and oil prices generally stimulate

demand and
result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies,
equipment, services and raw materials.  In addition, our E&P operations
also require local access to large quantities of water supplies and disposal
services for produced water in connection with our hydraulic fracture
stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs. We cannot be certain when
we will experience shortages or price increases, which could adversely affect
our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to
drill wells and conduct ordinary operations.
Our business
could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our
business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better
competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we
frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses,
concessions, marketing agreements, equipment and labor against companies with
financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess.  Many
of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and
productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.
 Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire
additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct
operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in this highly competitive environment.  In addition, many of
our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer
time than we have or have established strategic long-term positions in
geographic regions in which we may seek new entry.
We have made
significant investments in our own drilling rig and sand mine operations in
order to meet certain of our oilfield service and resource needs, lower our
costs and increase of the efficiency of our operations.  If disrupted,
these operations may adversely impact our results of operations.  In
addition, these operations may adversely impact our relationships with
third-party providers.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We have made significant investments in order to meet certain of
our oilfield services needs, including establishing our own drilling rig
operations and sand mine and we may make additional investments to expand these
operations in the future.  Our drilling operations are conducted through
our subsidiary, DDI, which had 366 employees as of December 31, 2009.  We
have lease commitments for 14 drilling rigs and related equipment with respect
to DDI's operations and we also own one drilling rig.  In addition to these
rigs, we have contracts with third-party drilling companies for use of their
rigs which may not be terminable without penalty.  In 2009, another of our
subsidiaries, DeSoto Sand, LLC, began operating our first sand mine in Arkansas
in order to meet a portion of our sand needs for the Fayetteville Shale play. We
also purchase sand for use in our operations from various third parties,
including certain of our oilfield service providers.  Our drilling rig and
sand mine operations may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our
existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure
these services and resources from other providers.  We may also compete
with third-party providers for qualified personnel, which could adversely affect
our relationships with such providers. If the operations of our drilling rigs
operations and/or sand mine are disrupted or our existing third-party providers
discontinue their relationships with us, we may not be able to secure
alternative services or resources on a timely basis, or at all.  Even if we
are able to secure alternative services or resources, there can be no assurance
that such services or resources will be of equivalent quality or that pricing
and other terms will be favorable to us.  If we are unable to secure
third-party services or resources or if the terms are not favorable to us, our
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We depend upon
our management team and our operations require us to attract and retain
experienced technical personnel.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The successful implementation of our business strategy and
handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy
depends, in part, on our experienced management team, as well as certain key
geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals employed by us.

technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 46px"
align=justify>To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural
gas and oil, historically, we have entered into hedging arrangements with
respect to a significant portion of our expected production.  As of
December 31, 2009, we had hedges on approximately 16% of our targeted 2010
natural gas production as compared to approximately 60% to 80% from 2006 to
2008 and 45% for 2009.  Our price risk management activities increased gas
sales by $587.8 million in 2009, decreased gas sales by $40.5 million in 2008
and increased gas sales by $70.7 million in 2007. If natural gas prices decline
in 2010, unless we enter into additional hedging arrangements, our revenues
would be adversely affected.   To the extent  <FONT

to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable
environmental rules.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of
or recycle water used in our E&P operations, could adversely impact our
operations, particularly with respect to our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus
Shale operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and
regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain
operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not
limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the
exploration, development or production of natural gas.  The Federal Water
Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA, imposes restrictions and strict
controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and
oil waste into navigable waters.  Permits must be obtained to discharge
pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and
wetlands.  The FWPCA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and
administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and
unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous
substances. Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and
sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to
the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. The EPA has also adopted
regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production
facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Compliance with
environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal,
storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic
fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays,
interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be
predicted, all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and
financial condition.

additional regulatory measures that may adversely impact our operations and

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 46px"
align=justify>Our E&P operations are currently focused on the production of
hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, and we expect to continue to focus on
such resources in the future. The production of hydrocarbons from these sources
has an energy intensity that is a number of times higher than that for
production from conventional sources. Therefore, we expect that the carbon
dioxide, or CO2, intensity of our production will increase in the long-term. We
actively seek to reduce the environmental impact of our operations by
pursuing more efficient use of natural resources such as hydrocarbons and
water and managing and mitigating the emissions to the air, water and soil,
with a focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. With the efforts of
our Health, Safety and Environmental Department, we have been able to plan for
and comply with environmental initiatives without materially altering our
operating strategy. We anticipate making increased expenditures of both a
capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws
relating to the protection of the environment that will increase the cost of
equipment, materials and services whose production utilizes hydrocarbons. We may
also face increased competition from alternative energy sources that do not rely
on hydrocarbons. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our
future exposure concerning such matters and if we are unable to find solutions
to environmental initiatives as they arise, including reducing the CO2 emissions
for our existing projects, we may have additional costs as well as compliance
and operational risks with respect to our existing operations as well as facing
difficulties in pursuing new projects.<FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt"
