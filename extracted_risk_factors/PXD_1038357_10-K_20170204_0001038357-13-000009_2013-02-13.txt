. Risk Factors — Exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves" below.Integrated services. The Company continues to expand its integrated services to control drilling and operating costs and support the execution of its drilling program and operating activities. The Company has 15 owned vertical drilling rigs operating in the Spraberry field, and at the end of 2012, had Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling 300,000 horsepower supporting drilling operations in the Spraberry, Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale Combo areas. During April 2012, the Company acquired 100 percent of the share capital of Industrial Sands Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oglebay Norton Industry Sands, LLC, for an aggregate purchase price of $297.1 million.  The Company changed the name of the Oglebay Norton Industrial Sands LLC to Premier Silica LLC ("Premier Silica") in April 2012.  See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information about the acquisition of Premier Silica. The Company also owns other field service equipment, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools.Acquisition activities. The Company regularly seeks to acquire properties that complement its operations, provide exploration and development opportunities and potentially provide superior returns on investment. In addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the Company to expand into new geographical areas that provide future exploration/exploitation opportunities. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company spent $157.5 million, $131.9 million and $181.6 million, respectively, to purchase primarily undeveloped acreage for future exploitation and exploration activities.The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition opportunities (including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas assets or entities owning oil and gas assets and opportunities to engage in mergers, consolidations or other business combinations with such entities) and at any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal financial analyses, oil and gas reserve analyses, due diligence, the submission of indications of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiation of letters of intent or negotiation of definitive agreements. The success of any acquisition is uncertain and depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control. See ". Risk Factors" and Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information about significant customer and infrastructure capacity risks.Derivative risk management activities. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company also utilizes commodity swap contracts to reduce price volatility on the fuel that the Company's drilling rigs and fracture stimulation fleets consume. The Company accounts for its derivative contracts using the mark-to-market ("MTM") method of accounting. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a description of the Company's derivative risk management activities, "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," and Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information about the impact of commodity derivative activities on oil, NGL and gas revenues and net derivative gains and losses during 2012, 2011 and 2010, as well as the Company's open commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2012.Competition, Markets and RegulationsCompetition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. A large number of companies, including major integrated and other independent companies, and individuals engage in the exploration for and development of oil and gas properties, and there is a high degree of competition for oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration. Acquisitions of oil and gas properties have been an important element of the Company's growth. The Company intends to continue acquiring oil and gas properties that complement its operations, provide exploration and development opportunities and potentially provide superior returns on investment. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of oil and gas properties include the staff and data necessary to identify, evaluate and acquire such properties and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop the properties. Many of the Company's competitors are substantially larger and have financial and other resources greater than those of the Company.Markets. The Company's ability to produce and market oil, NGLs and gas profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the Company's control. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect these commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production.Securities regulations. Enterprises that sell securities in public markets are subject to regulatory oversight by agencies such as the SEC and the NYSE. This regulatory oversight imposes on the Company the responsibility for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and ensuring that the financial statements and other information included in submissions to the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in such submissions not misleading. Failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC could subject the Company to litigation from public or private plaintiffs. Failure to comply with the rules of the NYSE could result in the de-listing of the Company's common stock, which would have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Company's common stock. Compliance with some of these rules and regulations is costly, and regulations are subject to change or reinterpretation. 9Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYEnvironmental and occupational health and safety matters. The Company's operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, worker health and safety, and the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:•require the acquisition of various permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences;•enjoin some or all of the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits;•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and gas drilling, production and transportation activities;•limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;•impose specific criteria addressing worker protection; and•require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant effect on the Company's operating costs.The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Company's current operations and that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Company did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2012. Additionally, the Company is not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2013. Nevertheless, accidental spills or releases may occur in the course of the Company's operations, and the Company cannot give any assurance that it will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons. Moreover, the Company cannot give any assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.The following is a summary of some of the more significant laws and regulations to which the Company's business operations are or may be subject.Waste handling. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently regulated under RCRA's non-hazardous waste provisions. It is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in the Company's costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of the Company's operations, it generates some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.Wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM") may also be generated in connection with the Company's operations. NORM is subject primarily to individual state radiation control regulations. In addition, NORM handling and management activities are governed by regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). These state and OSHA regulations impose certain requirements concerning worker protection; the treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste; the management of waste piles, containers and tanks containing NORM; as well as restrictions on the uses of land with NORM contamination.Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.10Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe Company currently owns or leases numerous properties that have been used for oil and gas exploration and production for many years. Although the Company believes it has used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by the Company, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's properties have been operated by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons were not under the Company's control. Certain of these properties have had historical petroleum spills or releases. All of such properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the Company could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. If a surface spill or release were to occur, the Company expects that it would be controlled, contained and remediated in accordance with the applicable requirements of state oil and gas commissions and by using the Company's spill prevention, control and countermeasure ("SPCC") plans or other spill or emergency contingency plans that it maintains in accordance with EPA requirements.Water discharges and use. The federal Clean Water Act (the "CWA") and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. SPCC planning requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.The primary federal law imposing liability for oil spills is the Oil Pollution Act ("OPA"), which sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be subject to oil spill cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. If an oil spill subject to the requirements of OPA were to occur at a Company property, the Company expects that it would be controlled, contained and remediated in accordance with the applicable requirements of OPA and by using the Company's OPA spill response plan together with the assistance of trained first responders and any oil spill response contractor that the Company would have been required to engage pursuant to OPA to address such oil spills.Operations associated with the Company's properties also produce wastewaters that are disposed via injection in underground wells. These injection wells are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (the "SDWA") and analogous state and local laws. The underground injection well program under the SDWA requires permits from the EPA or analogous state agency for the Company's disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected. Currently, the Company believes that disposal well operations on the Company's properties comply with all applicable requirements under the SDWA. However, a change in the regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect the Company's ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of the Company's operations. In addition, in response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewaters, federal and state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. The U.S. Geological Survey is advising the EPA regarding potential seismic hazards associated with these types of underground injection wells. It is possible that federal or state agencies will seek to regulate more stringently the underground injection of oil and gas wastewaters as a result of these events. Nevertheless, the Company is not aware of any imminent actions by federal or state agencies that would affect its use or operation of underground injection wells.The Company also routinely uses hydraulic fracturing techniques in the majority of its drilling and completion programs in Texas, Colorado and elsewhere, where development of most of the Company's properties are dependent on the Company's ability to hydraulically fracture the producing formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to stimulate oil and gas production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuels under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has published draft permitting guidance in May 2012 addressing the performance of such activities. In November 2011, the EPA announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and the agency currently projects to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2013 that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations. In August 2012, the EPA published final rules under the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA"), which became effective October 15, 2012, that, among other things, require producers to reduce volatile organic 11Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYcompound emissions from certain subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are being conducted by routing flowback emissions to a gathering line or capturing and combusting flowback emissions using a combustion device, such as a flare, until January 1, 2015 or performing reduced emission completions, also known as "green completions," with or without combustion devices, on or after January 1, 2015.  In addition, the U.S. Congress, from time to time, has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Company currently operates or in the future plans to operate, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities.Certain states in which the Company operates, including Colorado and Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas (the "TRRC") and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. The Company believes that it follows applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in its hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, in the event state or local restrictions are adopted in areas where the Company is currently conducting, or in the future plans to conduct operations, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that the Company is ultimately able to produce from its reserves. Certain governmental reviews were recently conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a first progress report released by the agency on December 21, 2012 and a final report expected to be available for public comments and peer review by 2014. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by 2014. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These studies, or future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.The water produced by the Company's CBM operations also may be subject to the laws of various states and regulatory bodies regarding the ownership and use of water. For example, in connection with the Company's CBM operations in the Raton Basin in Colorado, water is removed from coal seams to reduce pressure and allow the methane to be recovered. Historically, these operations have been regulated by the state agency responsible for regulating oil and gas activity in the state. In a 2008 case brought by the owners of ranch land involving a CBM competitor in a different CBM basin in Colorado, the Colorado Supreme Court held that water produced in connection with the CBM operations should be subject to state water-use regulations administered by a different agency that regulates other uses of water in the state, including requirements to obtain permits for diversion and use of surface and subsurface water, an evaluation of potential competing uses of the water, and a possible requirement to provide mitigation water for other water users. The Colorado legislature and state agency adopted laws and regulations in response to this ruling, but there continue to be litigation and uncertainty regarding permitting of produced water withdrawn in connection with CBM activities. The Company's CBM or other oil and gas operations and the Company's ability to expand its operations could be adversely affected, and these changes in regulation could ultimately increase the Company's cost of doing business.Air emissions. The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. Such laws and regulations may require a facility to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions; obtain or strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations; or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions of certain air pollutants. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Moreover, states can impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can also impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.Permits and related compliance obligations under the CAA, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment areas, may require the Company to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies for gas and oil exploration and production operations. On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that subject oil and gas production, processing, 12Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYtransmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. With regards to production activities, these final rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted:  wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all "other" fractured and refractured gas wells.  All three subcategories of wells must route flowback emissions to a gathering line or capture and combust flowback emissions using a combustion device, such as a flare, after October 15, 2012.  However, the "other" wells must use reduced emission completions, also known as "green completions, " with or without combustion devices, on or after January 1, 2015.  These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, effective October 15, 2012 and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels, effective October 15, 2013.  The Company is currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential effects on its operations.  Compliance with these requirements could increase the Company's costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. In addition, in response to reported concerns about high concentrations of benzene in the air near certain drilling sites and gas processing facilities in the Barnett Shale area, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (the "TCEQ") adopted new air emissions limitations and permitting requirements for oil and gas facilities in the state, which are applicable to facilities located in the Barnett Shale area. These new requirements could increase the cost and time associated with drilling wells in the Barnett Shale. The agency's investigations could lead to additional, more stringent air permitting requirements, increased regulation, and possible enforcement actions against producers, including Pioneer, in the Barnett Shale area. Any adoption of laws, regulations, orders or other legally enforceable mandates governing gas drilling and operating activities in the Barnett Shale or other areas of Texas that result in more stringent drilling or operating conditions or limit or prohibit the drilling of new wells for any extended period of time could increase the Company's costs or reduce its production, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.Some gas and oil production facilities may be included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources, which are subject to increasing regulation under the CAA. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject a regulated entity to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and enforcement actions. Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act (the "ESA") and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of the Company's operations are conducted in areas where protected species or their habitats are known to exist. In these areas, the Company may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and the Company may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when the Company's operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where the Company performs activities could result in increased costs or limitations on the Company's ability to perform operations and thus have an adverse effect on the Company's business.As a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the ESA and issue decisions with respect to the 250 candidate species before completion of the agency's 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company operates could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on the Company's exploration and production activities that could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to develop and produce its proved reserves.Occupational health and safety. The Company's operations are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and the related regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statues require that the Company organize or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in the Company's operations. In addition, the Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters.  The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these applicable standards and with OSHA and comparable requirements.Global warming and climate change. In December 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other "greenhouse gases" ("GHGs") present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes.  Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA in 2010 establishing Title V and Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting requirements for large sources of GHGs. The Company could become subject to these permitting 13Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYrequirements and be required to install "best available control technology" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that the Company may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities, which includes certain of the Company's facilities. The Company is monitoring GHG emissions from its operations in accordance with these GHG emissions reporting rules and believes its monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.  If the U.S. Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on the Company's operations.Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would affect the Company's business, any such future laws and regulations could require the Company to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements including the imposition of a carbon tax. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and gas the Company produces. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.Other regulation of the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous federal and state departments and agencies are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry may increase the Company's cost of doing business by increasing the cost of production, these burdens generally do not affect the Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.Development and production. Development and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, the posting of bonds in connection with various types of activities and filing reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which the Company operates also regulate one or more of the following:•the location of wells;•the method of drilling and casing wells;•the method and ability to fracture stimulate wells;•the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;•the plugging and abandoning of wells; and•notice to surface owners and other third parties.State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the Company's interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas the Company can produce from the Company's wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and gas within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and gas that may be produced from the Company's wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells, or limit the number of locations the Company can drill.14Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYRegulation of transportation and sale of gas. The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of gas. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to gas pipeline transportation. Intrastate gas pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as orders of state regulatory bodies. The interstate transportation and sale of gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). FERC endeavors to make gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access and non-discriminatory basis.Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ("EPAct 2005") it is unlawful for "any entity," including producers such as the Company, that are otherwise not subject to FERC's jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (the "NGA") to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. FERC's rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties up to $1.0 million per day per violation of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of entities not otherwise subject to FERC's jurisdiction to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704 (defined below).In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing ("Order 704"). Under Order 704,  any market participant, including a producer such as the Company, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBTUs of physical gas in the previous calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices.  It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the gas industry are considered from time to time by the U.S. Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts.  The Company cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective or their effect, if any, on its operations.  The Company does not believe that it will be affected by any action taken in a materially different way than other gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which it competes.Gas gathering. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from FERC's jurisdiction. The Company believes that its gathering facilities meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline system's status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so the classification and regulation of some of the Company's gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC and the courts. Thus, the Company cannot guarantee that the jurisdictional status of its gas gathering facilities will remain unchanged.While the Company owns or operates some gas gathering facilities, the Company also depends on gathering facilities owned and operated by third parties to gather production from its properties, and therefore the Company is affected by the rates charged by these third parties for gathering services. To the extent that changes in federal or state regulation affect the rates charged for gathering services, the Company also may be affected by these changes. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate that the Company would be affected any differently than similarly situated gas producers.Regulation of transportation and sale of oil and NGLs. The liquids industry is also extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. In a number of instances, the ability to transport and sell such products on interstate pipelines is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act (the "ICA").  The Company does not believe these regulations affect it any differently than other producers.The ICA requires that pipelines maintain a tariff on file with FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service.  The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be "just and reasonable."  Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential.  Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before FERC.Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC.  For the five-15Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYyear period beginning in 2010, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 2.65 percent.  This adjustment is subject to review every five years.  Under FERC's regulations, a liquids pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology.  Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows for the Company. In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity.  Therefore, new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to the Company. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that the Company relies upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  However, the Company believes that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to it to the same extent as to its similarly-situated competitors.Intrastate liquids pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions.  The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state.  The Company believes that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect its operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on its similarly-situated competitors.In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry.  Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per violation per day.  In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC.  This authority, with respect to oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FERC and the FTC as described above.  In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement their new anti-manipulation authority.  The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1.0 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.Energy commodity prices. Sales prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, the U.S. Congress historically has been active in their regulation. The Company cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and gas, or the prices charged for these commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the U.S. Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the Company's operations.Transportation of hazardous materials. The federal Department of Transportation has adopted regulations requiring that certain entities transporting designated hazardous materials develop plans to address security risks related to the transportation of hazardous materials. The Company does not believe that these requirements will have an adverse effect on the Company or its operations. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the security plans required under these regulations would protect against all security risks and prevent an attack or other incident related to the Company's transportation of hazardous materials. ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to the Company's business activities. Other risks are described in "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. The Company's business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations and impair the Company's ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of the Company's common stock could decline.The prices of oil, NGL and gas are highly volatile. A sustained decline in these commodity prices could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.The Company's revenues, profitability, cash flow and future rate of growth are highly dependent on commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Company's control, such as:•domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas;•inventory levels at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark for WTI oil prices;16Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY•gas inventory levels in the United States;•weather conditions;•overall domestic and global political and economic conditions;•actions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;•the effect of liquefied natural gas deliveries to and exports from the United States;•technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;•the effect of energy conservation efforts;•the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities; and•the price and availability of alternative fuels.In the past, commodity prices have been extremely volatile, and the Company expects this volatility to continue. For example, during 2012, oil prices fluctuated from a high of $109.77 per BBL in February to a low of $77.69 per BBL in June, while gas prices fluctuated from a low of $1.91 per MCF in April to a high of $3.90 per MCF in November. During 2011, oil prices fluctuated from a high $113.93 per BBL in April to a low of $75.67 per BBL in October, while gas prices fluctuated from a high of $4.85 per MCF in June to a low of $2.99 per MCF in December. The Company makes price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of the Company's cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancellable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, the Company's financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.Significant or extended price declines could also adversely affect the amount of oil, NGL and gas that the Company can produce economically. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require the Company to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively affect the Company's ability to replace its production and its future rate of growth.The Company could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.Historically, the Company's capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, NGL and gas prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that the Company and its vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Increased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry in recent periods have led to increased costs of some drilling equipment, materials and supplies. Such costs may rise faster than increases in the Company's revenue, thereby negatively impacting the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget. This impact may be magnified to the extent that the Company's ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by its derivative risk management activities.The Company's derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses.To achieve more predictable cash flow and to manage the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and gas, the Company's strategy is to enter into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and gas production. These derivative arrangements are subject to MTM accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company's statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant unrealized net gains or losses. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:•production is less than the contracted derivative volumes;•the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations; or•the derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.On the other hand, failure to protect against declines in commodity prices exposes the Company to reduced liquidity when prices decline.The failure by counterparties to the Company's derivative risk management activities to perform their obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.The use of derivative risk management transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. If any of these counterparties were to default on its obligations under the Company's derivative 17Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYarrangements, such a default could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, and could result in a larger percentage of the Company's future production being subject to commodity price changes. Exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.Drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or become costlier, as a result of a variety of factors, including:•unexpected drilling conditions;•unexpected pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•fracture stimulation accidents or failures;•adverse weather conditions;•restricted access to land for drilling or laying pipelines; and•access to, and the cost and availability of, the equipment, services and personnel required to complete the Company's drilling, completion and operating activities.The Company's future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental, extension or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory and extension drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The Company expects that it will continue to experience exploration and abandonment expense in 2013.Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.Declines in commodity prices may result in the Company having to make substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if the Company's estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require the Company to impair, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties. The Company is required to perform impairment tests on proved oil and gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved properties may not be recoverable. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value. For example, during 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized impairment charges of $532.6 million and $354.4 million, respectively, due to the impairment of the Company's Barnett Shale field and Edwards and Austin Chalk gas fields in South Texas, primarily due to declines in gas prices and downward adjustments to the economically recoverable resource potential. The Company may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations in the period incurred.The Company periodically evaluates its unproved oil and gas properties and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.At December 31, 2012, the Company carried unproved property costs of $231.6 million. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis. These evaluations are affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, and contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.The Company periodically evaluates its goodwill for impairment and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.At December 31, 2012, the Company carried goodwill of $298.1 million. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the third quarter using a July 1 assessment date, and also whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may be impaired, requiring an estimate of the fair values of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities. Those assessments may be affected by (a) additional reserve adjustments both positive and negative, (b) results of drilling activities, (c) management's outlook for commodity prices and costs and expenses, (d) changes in the Company's market capitalization, (e) changes in the Company's weighted average cost of capital and (f) changes in income taxes. If the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets is not sufficient to fully support the goodwill balance in the future, the Company will reduce the carrying value 18Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYof goodwill for the impaired value, with a corresponding noncash charge to earnings in the period in which goodwill is determined to be impaired.The Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, and any acquisition it completes is subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect its business.Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have from time to time contributed to the Company's growth. The Company's growth following the full development of its existing property base could be impeded if it is unable to acquire additional oil and gas reserves on a profitable basis. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas industry are very competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause the Company to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors and involves potential risks, including among other things:•the inability to estimate accurately the costs to develop the reserves, the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net cash flows attainable from the reserves;•the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which the Company is not indemnified or for which the indemnity the Company receives is inadequate;•the validity of assumptions about costs, including synergies;•the effect on the Company's liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions;•the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the Company's growing business and assets.All of these factors affect whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even though the Company performs a review of the properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are often limited in scope. As a result, among other risks, the Company's initial estimates of reserves may be subject to revision following an acquisition, which may materially and adversely affect the desired benefits of the acquisition.The Company's ability to complete dispositions of assets, or interests in assets, may be subject to factors beyond its control, and in certain cases the Company may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.From time to time, the Company sells an interest in a strategic asset for the purpose of assisting or accelerating the asset's development. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its property base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors could materially affect the ability of the Company to dispose of such interests or nonstrategic assets or complete announced dispositions, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties (as is the case with respect to the Company's southern Wolfcamp joint interest transaction) and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the nonstrategic assets on terms and at prices acceptable to the Company. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company was unable to dispose of its Barnett Shale assets under acceptable terms.  Consequently, the Company no longer expects to dispose of the Barnett Shale assets during 2013 and has reclassified the Barnett Shale assets to held for use and their historical results of operations to continuing operations.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information about the Barnett Shale disposition plans. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the Company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, the Company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.The Company's gas processing operations are subject to operational risks, which could result in significant damages and the loss of revenue.As of December 31, 2012, the Company owned interests in four gas processing plants and ten treating facilities. The Company is the operator of two of the gas processing plants and all ten of the treating facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of gas processing plants. Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include carcinogens. Damage to or improper operation of a gas processing plant or facility could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue source. 19Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe Company's operations involve many operational risks, some of which could result in unforeseen interruptions to the Company's operations and substantial losses to the Company for which the Company may not be adequately insured.The Company's operations, including well stimulation and completion activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all the risks normally incident to the oil and gas development and production business, including:•blowouts, cratering, explosions and fires;•adverse weather effects;•environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, encountering NORM, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;•high costs, shortages or delivery delays of equipment, labor or other services or water for hydraulic fracturing;•facility or equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;•title problems;•pipe or cement failures or casing collapses;•compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;•lost or damaged oilfield workover and service tools;•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations; and•natural disasters.The Company's overall exposure to operational risks may increase as its drilling activity expands and as it seeks to directly provide drilling, fracture stimulation and other services internally. Any of these risks could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations.The Company is not fully insured against certain of the risks described above, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining such insurance. Additionally, the Company relies to a large extent on facilities owned and operated by third-parties, and damage to or destruction of those third-party facilities could affect the ability of the Company to produce, transport and sell its hydrocarbons.The Company's expectations for future drilling activities will be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of such activities.The Company has identified drilling locations and prospects for future drilling opportunities, including development, exploratory and infill drilling and enhanced recovery activities. These drilling locations and prospects represent a significant part of the Company's future drilling plans. For example, the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2012 include proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed reserves that are behind pipe of 271.4 MMBBLs of oil, 103.0 MMBBLs of NGLs and 714.6 BCF of gas. The Company's ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs, access to and availability of equipment, services and personnel and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of proved reserves or meet the Company's expectations for success. As such, the Company's actual drilling and enhanced recovery activities may materially differ from the Company's current expectations, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's proved reserves, financial condition and results of operations.The Company may not be able to obtain access to pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation,  processing, fractionation and refining facilities to market its oil, NGL and gas production; the Company relies on a limited number of purchasers for a majority of its products.The marketing of oil, NGL and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing, fractionation and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, if these systems were unavailable to the Company, or if access to these systems were to become commercially unreasonable, the price offered for the Company's production could be significantly depressed, or the Company could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while it constructs its own facility. The Company also relies (and expects to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transport, fractionate and sell its oil, NGL and gas production. The Company's plans to develop and sell its oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient transportation, storage or 20Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYprocessing and fractionation facilities to the Company, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist.To the extent that the Company enters into transportation contracts with gas pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, the Company is subject to FERC requirements related to use of such capacity.  Any failure on the Company's part to comply with FERC's regulations and policies or with an interstate pipeline's tariff could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.A limited number of companies purchase a majority of the Company's oil, NGLs and gas. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell its production.The nature of the Company's assets and production operations exposes it to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and occupational safety matters.The oil and gas business involves the production, handling, sale and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials and is subject to environmental hazards, such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks,  pipeline and vessel ruptures and unauthorized discharges of substances or gases, that could expose the Company to substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductible associated with obtaining such insurance. A variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and gas business. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups, and natural resource damages or other liabilities, and compliance with these laws and regulations may increase the cost of the Company's operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the costs of acquisitions. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations — Environmental and occupational health and safety matters" above for additional discussion related to environmental risks.Environmental laws and regulations are subject to amendment or replacement by more stringent laws and regulations and no assurance can be given that continued compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment of production or processing activities, result in a material increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing operations or adversely affect the Company's future operations and financial condition. The Company could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs at its properties or as a result of its operations.There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in operations upon the Company's properties due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and water discharges related to its operations, and as a result of historical operations and waste disposal practices by prior owners and operators.  The Company currently owns, leases or operates properties that for many years have been used for oil and gas exploration and production activities, and petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes have been released on or under such properties and could be released during future operations.  Joint and several strict liabilities may be incurred in connection with such releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from the Company's properties.  Private parties, including lessors of properties on which the Company operates and the owners or operators of properties adjacent to the Company's operations and facilities where the Company's petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.  The Company may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of indemnity.The Company's credit facilities and debt instruments have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict its business and financing activities.The Company is a borrower under fixed rate senior notes, convertible senior notes and credit facilities. The terms of the Company's borrowings under the senior notes, convertible senior notes and the credit facilities specify scheduled debt repayments and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and restrictions. The Company's ability to comply with the debt repayment terms, associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things, factors outside the Company's direct control, such as commodity prices and interest rates. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2012 and the terms associated therewith.The Company's ability to obtain additional financing is also affected by the Company's debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. 21Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe Company faces significant competition, and many of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources.The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a large number of companies, producers and operators in a number of areas such as:•seeking to acquire oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration;•marketing oil, NGL and gas production; and•seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise, including trained personnel, necessary to evaluate, operate and develop properties.Many of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" for additional discussion regarding competition.The Company is subject to regulations that may cause it to incur substantial costs.The Company's business is regulated by a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. For instance, in connection with the Company's CBM operations in the Raton Basin in Colorado, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed a state water court holding that water produced in connection with CBM operations should be subject to state water-use regulations, including regulations requiring permits for diversion and use of surface and subsurface water, an evaluation of potential competing permits, possible uses of the water and a possible requirement to provide augmentation water supplies for water rights owners with more senior rights. There can be no assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely affect the Company's business and operations, including that the Company may be required to suspend drilling operations or shut in production pending compliance. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" for additional discussion regarding government regulation.The Company's sales of oil, gas, NGLs or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to such energy commodities, expose the Company to potential regulatory risks.FERC, the FTC and the CFTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to the Company's business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to the Company's physical sales of oil, gas, NGLs or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to these energy commodities, the Company is required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business results of operations and financial condition.Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities and net cash flows of the Company's proved reserves may prove to be lower than estimated.Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows set forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:•historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;•the quality and quantity of available data;•the interpretation of that data;•the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;•assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and•assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, development costs, transportation costs and workover and remedial costs.Because all proved reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:•the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered;•the production costs incurred to recover the reserves;•the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and•future commodity prices.22Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of proved reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The Company's actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to proved reserves will likely be different from estimates, and the differences may be material.As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average prices preceding the date of the estimate and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:•the amount and timing of actual production;•levels of future capital spending;•increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, NGLs and gas; and•changes in governmental regulations or taxation.Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In general, it requires the use of commodity prices that are based upon a 12-month unweighted average, as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure in this Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.The Company's actual production could differ materially from its forecasts.From time to time, the Company provides forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Should these estimates prove inaccurate, actual production could be adversely affected. In addition, the Company's forecasts assume that none of the risks associated with the Company's oil and gas operations summarized in this "Item 1A. Risk Factors" occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects, or downturns in commodity prices or significant increases in costs, which could make certain drilling activities or production uneconomical.A subsidiary of the Company acts as the general partner of a publicly-traded limited partnership. As such, the subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.A subsidiary of the Company acts as the general partner of Pioneer Southwest, a publicly-traded limited partnership formed by the Company to own, develop and acquire oil and gas assets in its area of operations. As general partner, the subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations to Pioneer Southwest.Activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to others typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. Any such liability may be material.The tax treatment of Pioneer Southwest depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as well as its not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") were to treat Pioneer Southwest as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or Pioneer Southwest becomes subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then the value of the Company's investment in Pioneer Southwest would be substantially reduced.The Company currently owns a 52.4 percent limited partner interest and a 0.1 percent general partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The value of the Company's investment in Pioneer Southwest depends largely on its being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. A publicly traded partnership may be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes unless 90 percent or more of its gross income for every year is "qualifying income" under section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pioneer Southwest has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the IRS with respect to its treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.A change in Pioneer Southwest's business could cause it to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. In addition, a change in current law may cause Pioneer Southwest to be treated as a corporation for such purposes. For example, members of U.S. Congress have from time to time considered substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that 23Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYwould affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships. Moreover, because of widespread state budget deficits, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. If Pioneer Southwest were subject to federal income tax as a corporation or any state were to impose a tax upon Pioneer Southwest, its cash available to pay distributions would be reduced. Therefore, treatment of Pioneer Southwest as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to Pioneer Southwest's unitholders, including the Company, and would likely cause a substantial reduction in the value of the Company's investment in Pioneer Southwest.Pioneer Southwest's partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects it to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects it to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the effect of that law on Pioneer Southwest.The Company's business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.As an oil and gas producer, the Company faces various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of the Company's facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected the Company's operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In particular, the Company's implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for the Company's information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to the Company's operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could damage the Company's reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. A failure by purchasers of the Company's production to perform their obligations to the Company could require the Company to recognize a pre-tax charge in earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.While the credit and equity markets have improved during 2010, 2011 and 2012, the economic outlook for 2013 remains uncertain. The Company relies on a limited number of purchasers to purchase a majority of its products. To the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time. If for any reason the Company were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of the Company's production were uncollectible, the Company would recognize a pre-tax charge in the earnings of that period for the probable loss.Declining general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.Concerns over the worldwide economic outlook, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and the U.S. mortgage and real estate markets have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile commodity prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment resulted in a worldwide recession. While the worldwide economic outlook seems to be improving, concerns about global economic growth or government debt in Europe or the United States could have a significant adverse effect on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad were to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could depress the prices at which the Company could sell its oil, NGLs and gas and ultimately decrease the Company's net revenue and profitability.Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas companies. Such tax legislation changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical 24Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYexpenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect the value of an investment in the Company's common stock and defer planned capital expenditures if such changes accelerated the payment of taxes.The adoption of climate change legislation by the U.S. Congress or regulation by the EPA could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGLs and gas the Company produces.In December 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA in 2010 establishing Title V and Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting requirements for large sources of GHGs.  The Company could become subject to these permitting requirements and be required to install "best available control technology" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that the Company may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities, which include certain of the Company's facilities. The Company is monitoring GHG emissions from its operations in accordance with these GHG emissions reporting rules and believes that its monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. If the U.S. Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on the Company's operations.Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or  new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would affect the Company's business, any such future laws and regulations could require the Company to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and gas the Company produces. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. See "Item 1. Business – Competition, Markets and Regulations - Environmental and occupational health and safety matters - Global warming and climate change" for additional discussion relating to global warming and climate change.The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with its business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") enacted on July 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Act. In its rulemaking under the Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide derivative transactions would be exempt from these position limits. The position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Colombia in September 2012, although the CFTC has stated that it will appeal the District Court's decision.  The CFTC also has finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definition of "swap", "security-based swap", "swap dealer" and "major swap participant." The Act and the CFTC rules also will require the Company, in connection with certain derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements).   In addition, new regulations may require the Company to comply with margin requirements although these regulations are not finalized and their application to the Company is uncertain at this time. Other regulations also remain to be finalized, and the CFTC recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized.   As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Act and the CFTC rules on the Company and the timing of such effects.   The Act also may require the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which 25Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYmay not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect the Company's available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters, reduce the Company's ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts, and increase the Company's exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations implementing the Act, the Company's results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. The Company's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and its results of operations.Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect the Company's production.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The Company routinely utilizes hydraulic fracturing techniques in the majority of its drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to stimulate oil and gas production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuels under the SDWA's Underground Injection Control Program and published draft permitting guidance in May 2012 addressing the performance of such activities. In November 2011, the EPA announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and the agency currently projects to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2013 that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations. In August 2012, the EPA published final rules under the CAA, which became effective October 15, 2012, that, among other things, require producers to reduce volatile organic compound emissions from certain subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are being conducted by routing flowback emissions to a gathering line or capturing and combusting flowback emissions using a combustion device, such as a flare, until January 1, 2015 or performing reduced emission completions, also known as "green completions," with or without combustion devices, on or after January 1, 2015. In addition, the U.S. Congress, from time to time, has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In the event that a new federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where the Company currently or in the future plans to operate, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities.Certain states in which the Company operates, including Colorado and Texas have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations. For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the TRRC and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. The Company believes that it follows applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in its hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, in the event state or local restrictions are adopted in areas where the Company is currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that the Company is ultimately able to produce from its reserves.Certain governmental reviews were recently conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a first progress released by the agency on December 21, 2012 and a final report expected to be available for public comment and peer review by 2014. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by 2014. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These studies, or future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulations - Environmental and occupational health and safety matters" above for additional discussion related to environmental risks associated with the Company's hydraulic fracturing activities.26Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYProvisions of the Company's charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.Provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in the Company's board of directors and management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transaction and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.The Company is growing production in areas of high industry activity, which may affect its ability to obtain the personnel, equipment, services, resources and facilities access needed to complete its development activities as planned or result in increased costs.The Company's operations and drilling activity are concentrated in areas in which industry activity has increased rapidly, particularly in the Spraberry field in West Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas. As a result, demand for personnel, equipment, power, services and resources, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, has increased, as have the costs for those items. In addition, hydraulic fracturing and other operations require significant quantities of water, which supply may be affected by drought conditions. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources and facilities access necessary for the Company to complete its planned development activities, including the result of any changes in laws or regulations applicable to the Company's operations relating to water usage, could result in oil and gas production volumes being below the Company's forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability. Laws and regulations pertaining to threatened and endangered species could delay or restrict the Company's operations and cause it to incur substantial costs.Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the ESA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA and CERCLA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before completion of the agency's 2017 fiscal year.  The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company conducts operations could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on its exploration and production activities that could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to develop and produce reserves.The Company's sand mining operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond the Company's control, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.Ownership of industrial sand mining operations are subject to risks, many of which are beyond the Company's control. These risks include:•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;•cave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls;•unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;•inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;•environmental hazards, such as unauthorized spills, releases and discharges of wastes, vessel ruptures, and emission of unpermitted levels of pollutants;•changes in laws and regulations;•inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;•restrictions on blasting operations;•inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;27Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY•reduction in the amount of water available for processing;•technical difficulties or failures;•labor disputes;•late delivery of supplies;•fires, explosions or other accidents; and•facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company's mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Not all of these risks are insurable, and the Company's insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. The Company's insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet its needs in the event of loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company's estimates of sand reserves and resource deposits are imprecise and actual reserves could be less than estimated.The Company bases its sand reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, commercial sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of commercial sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Estimates of economically recoverable commercial sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:•geological and mining conditions or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;•assumptions concerning future prices of commercial sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and•assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.The Company's sand mining operations are subject to extensive environmental and occupational health and safety regulations that impose significant costs and potential liabilities. The Company's sand  mining operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral processing industry, including, among others, those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air emissions and water discharges, GHG emissions, water pollution, waste management and disposal, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use restrictions, reclamation and restoration of properties, hazardous materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct the Company's sand  mining operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose the Company to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair the Company's ability to conduct its sand  mining operations. In addition, environmental laws and regulations are subject to amendment, replacement or interpretation by more stringent and comprehensive legal requirements. The Company's continued compliance with existing or future laws and regulations could restrict the Company's ability to expand its facilities or extract mineral deposits or could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its sand mining operations, which restrictions or costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations.Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in connection with its sand mining operations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely affect the Company, including:•issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;•denial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;•imposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on the Company's operations, including cessation of operations; and•requirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.28Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYIn addition to environmental regulation, the Company's sand mining operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, including such matters as human exposure to crystalline silica dust. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of the Company's sand mining operations.The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. The Company's failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand  mining operations or otherwise impose significant restrictions on the Company's ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.The Company's sand  mining operations are subject to extensive other regulations that impose significant costs and liabilities. In addition to the environmental and occupational health and safety regulation discussed above, the Company's sand mining operations are also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, and the effects that mining have on groundwater quality and availability. Also, the Company's sand mining operations require numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each sand mining facility.  In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future for its sand mining operations, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the effect that any such activities may have on the environment. Obtaining or renewing required permits may be delayed or prevented due to opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public or other third parties and other factors beyond the Company's control. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations at the affected facility. Current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations and the Company may not be able to renew or obtain permits in the future. The Company's sand mining operations entail silica-related health issues and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica dust is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders, such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the commercial sand industry. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling sand could materially and adversely affect the Company through the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits and increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Premier Silica is named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of Premier Silica's customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of December 31, 2012, Premier Silica was the subject of approximately 2,500 silica exposure claims, the great majority of which have been inactive for many years due to the plaintiffs' failure to meet specific legal requirements to advance their claims. Almost all of the claims pending against Premier Silica arise out of the alleged use of Premier Silica's sand products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Florida and West Virginia, although some cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. It is possible that Premier Silica will continue to have silica-related products liability claims filed against it, including claims that allege silica exposure for periods for which there is not insurance coverage. Any pending or future claims or inadequacies of insurance coverage or indemnification from the seller could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.The Company's pending sale of 40 percent of its acreage in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and may not be consummated on the terms or timeline contemplated and may not achieve the intended results.In January 2013, the Company agreed to sell 40 percent of its interest in 207,000 net acres leased by the Company in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field to Sinochem, an unaffiliated third party, for 29Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYconsideration of $1.7 billion.  At closing, Sinochem will pay $522.0 million in cash to Pioneer, before normal closing adjustments, and will pay the remaining $1.2 billion by carrying 75 percent of the Company's portion of future drilling and facilities costs attributable to the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play.  The Company expects this transaction to close during the second quarter of 2013.  However, the parties' obligations to consummate this transaction are conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including governmental and third party approvals.  If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be consummated. If the closing of the transaction is substantially delayed or does not occur at all, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction fully or at all.  Further, if the transaction is not completed, the Company would need to reevaluate its capital expenditure budget and reduce its activities or obtain funding from other sources. ITEM 1B
