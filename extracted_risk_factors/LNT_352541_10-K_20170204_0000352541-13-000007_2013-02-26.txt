GENERALAlliant Energy was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1981 and maintains its principal executive offices in Madison, Wisconsin.  Alliant Energy operates as a regulated investor-owned public utility holding company.  Alliant Energy’s primary focus is to provide regulated electricity and natural gas service to approximately 1 million electric and approximately 415,000 natural gas customers in the Midwest through its two public utility subsidiaries.  The primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy are: IPL, WPL, Resources and Corporate Services.  An illustration of Alliant Energy’s first tier subsidiaries is shown below.        Alliant Energy                                                IPL WPL  Resources Corporate ServicesA brief description of the primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy is as follows:1) IPL - was incorporated in 1925 in Iowa as Iowa Railway and Light Corporation.  IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in Iowa and southern Minnesota.  In Iowa, IPL provides utility services to incorporated communities as directed by the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) and utilizes non-exclusive franchises, which cover the use of public right-of-ways for utility facilities in incorporated communities for a maximum term of 25 years.  At December 31, 2012, IPL supplied electric and gas service to 526,841 and 233,820 retail customers, respectively.  IPL is also engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  In 2012, 2011 and 2010, IPL had no single customer for which electric, gas, steam and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of IPL’s consolidated revenues.2Table of Contents2) WPL - was incorporated in 1917 in Wisconsin as Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company.  WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in southern and central Wisconsin.  WPL operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of indefinite duration and state statutes authorizing utility operation in areas annexed by a municipality.  At December 31, 2012, WPL supplied electric and gas service to 458,180 and 181,028 retail customers, respectively.  In 2012, 2011 and 2010, WPL had no single customer for which electric, gas and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of WPL’s consolidated revenues.  WPL Transco LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPL and holds WPL’s investment in the American Transmission Company LLC (ATC).3) RESOURCES - was incorporated in 1988 in Wisconsin.  In 2008, Resources was converted to a limited liability company.  Alliant Energy’s non-regulated investments are organized under Resources.  Refer to “Information Relating to Non-regulated Operations” for additional details.4) CORPORATE SERVICES - was incorporated in 1997 in Iowa.

The following includes the primary regulations impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.3Table of ContentsFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) -Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005) - Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to PUHCA 2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities, service company and other entities regulated by FERC.  Corporate Services, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA 2005 for various matters including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books, records and accounting requirements.Energy Policy Act - The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the overarching ERO.  The Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), which is a regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.Federal Power Act - FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and transmission rates, dividend payments, issuance of securities (IPL and Corporate Services only) and accounting practices of Corporate Services, IPL and WPL.Electric Wholesale Rates - IPL and WPL have received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from FERC.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of electricity within the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) markets and in bilateral markets, based on the market value of the transactions.  IPL and WPL also have FERC-approved cost-of-service based rates related to the provision of firm full- and partial-requirement wholesale electric sales.  Both IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale cost-of-service tariffs are formula-based tariffs that allow for annual true-ups to actual costs, including fuel costs.Electric Transmission Rates - FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  Neither IPL nor WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates.  IPL and WPL rely primarily upon the use of the ITC Midwest LLC (ITC) and ATC transmission systems, respectively.FERC is performing an investigation into Attachment “O” protocols under the MISO tariff, focusing on the areas of participation, transparency and challenge procedures.  IPL filed comments related to ITC’s Attachment “O” protocols.  IPL supports increasing the participation, transparency and challenge procedures related to Attachment “O.”  ITC filed comments contrary to IPL’s position, alleging that the status quo affords IPL adequate information to challenge ITC’s rates.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for discussion of IPL’s formal complaint filed with FERC in September 2012 alleging that ITC’s Attachment “FF” tariff is unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory to IPL and its electric customers.Natural Gas Act - FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.Environmental - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to extensive environmental requirements.  The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management, transportation and clean-up, and solid waste management requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental programs to local agencies.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations.IUB - IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in Iowa for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities.Retail Utility Base Rates - IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate changes.  These filings are based on historical test periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable changes to capital investments, cost of capital and operating and maintenance expenses consistent with IUB rules and regulations.  Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10 days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past precedent.  The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate changes within 10 months of the date of the application for which changes are filed, or the interim rates granted become permanent.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for details of a retail electric base rate freeze effective for IPL’s Iowa customers through 2013.4Table of ContentsRetail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms - IPL’s retail electric and natural gas tariffs contain automatic adjustment clauses for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers in Iowa.  Any over- or under-collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery Mechanism - Effective February 2011, electric transmission service expenses were removed from base rates and billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers through the transmission cost rider.  This new cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to Iowa retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses.  Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are reflected in future billings to customers.  The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s decision in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, at which time the rider will be revisited.Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery (EECR) Mechanism - In accordance with Iowa law, IPL is required to file an Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) every five years with the IUB.  An EEP provides a utility’s plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of energy savings.  IUB approval demonstrates that the IUB believes that IPL’s EEP is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective delivery of the energy efficiency programs.  To the extent approved by the IUB, costs associated with executing the EEP are recovered from ratepayers through an additional tariff called an EECR factor.  The EECR factors are revised annually and include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expenses from prior periods.Electric Generating Facilities - IPL must obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience, Use and Necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUB in order to construct a new or significantly alter an existing electric generating facility located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of capacity.Advance Rate-making Principles - Iowa Code §476.53 provides Iowa utilities with rate-making principles prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa.  As a result, IPL must file for, and the IUB must render a decision on, rate-making principles for electric generating facilities located in Iowa, including new base-load (nuclear or coal-fired generation) facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind facilities, of any size.  Upon approval of rate-making principles by the IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate-making principles, or not at all.Electric Generating Facility Emission Controls Projects - IPL is required to submit an Emissions Plan and Budget (EPB) biennially to the IUB setting out a multi-year plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its electric generating facilities in a cost-effective manner.  IPL must simultaneously submit this plan and budget to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for a determination of whether the plan and budget meet state environmental requirements for regulated emissions.  The reasonable costs associated with implementing the plan are expected to be included in IPL’s future retail electric rates.Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) - Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other matters.  WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, affiliate transactions, approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.Retail Utility Base Rates - WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate changes.  These filings are required to be based on forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide retail base rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts to process retail base rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary. Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for details of a retail electric and gas base rate freeze effective for WPL’s customers during 2013 and 2014.Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -Electric - WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of annual fuel-related costs (fuel and purchased power energy costs) anticipated during the test period.  During each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding, the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges.  Deferral of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the applicable authorized return on common equity.  Subject to review and approval by the PSCW, any deferred over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs for each year are reflected in future billings to retail customers.5Table of ContentsNatural Gas - WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas costs required to serve its retail gas customers.  Any over- or under-collection of natural gas costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.EECR Mechanism - WPL contributes a certain percentage of its annual retail utility revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin’s state-wide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program.  Estimated contributions to Focus on Energy, along with WPL-run energy efficiency program costs, are recovered from WPL’s retail customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings and include a reconciliation of such estimated amounts to actual costs incurred with any difference deferred for inclusion in future base rate changes.New Electric Generating Facilities - A Certificate of Authority (CA) application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility with a capacity of less than 100 MW.  WPL must obtain a GCU Certificate from the PSCW in order to construct a new electric generating facility in Wisconsin with a capacity of 100 MW or more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities (including those located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.Electric Generating Facility Upgrades - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any additions to electric generating facilities, including emission controls projects that exceed a certain threshold amount.  The current PSCW rules require a CA for projects with an estimated project cost of $10 million or more.Advance Rate-making Principles - Wisconsin Statute §196.371 provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate-making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled electric generating facility or renewable generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin Statute §196.371.  WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate-making terms or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin Statute §196.371.Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) - IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in Minnesota for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities that encumber property in Minnesota, affiliate transactions, and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.Retail Utility Rates - Requests for retail rate change can be based on either historical or projected data and interim retail rates are permitted.  IPL has historically requested retail rate relief based on historical test periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL and operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months of the end of the test year.  Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief; however, the MPUC can extend the timing by 90 days.Renewable Energy Cost Recovery Mechanism - In 2011, IPL received an order from the MPUC approving the implementation of an automatic cost recovery rider on a temporary basis to recover costs associated with renewable generation.  The renewable energy rider does not require a base rate case for annual revision of rates charged to IPL’s Minnesota retail electric customers, but requires that the renewable energy costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues collected for such costs.  Initially, this would allow recovery of IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project located in Iowa.  In 2011, the MPUC deferred judgment on the prudence of the Whispering Willow - East wind project costs.  The initial recovery amount of the project costs will be allowed through the temporary renewable energy rider at a levelized cost of $51 per megawatt-hour (MWh).  In January 2013, IPL filed a request with the MPUC for full cost recovery of the Minnesota retail portion of IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project construction costs of approximately $30 million.  IPL expects to receive a decision from the MPUC in 2013 for the final recovery amount for such costs.Refer to Notes 1(b), 1(h), 2 and 13(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and “Rate Matters,” “Environmental Matters” and “Legislative Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and utility rate matters.4) STRATEGIC OVERVIEW - Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of various strategic actions by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.6Table of ContentsC. INFORMATION RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONSAlliant Energy’s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL’s steam operations, various other energy-related products and services, and the unallocated portions of the utility business.  In 2012, IPL’s and WPL’s operating revenues and operating income (loss) for these three utility business segments were as follows: IPL WPL Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Revenues Income (Loss)Electric83% 83% 88% 91%Gas14% 12% 12% 10%Other3% 5% —% (1%) 100% 100% 100% 100%1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONSGeneral - Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing electric service in Iowa and southern Minnesota and WPL providing electric service in southern and central Wisconsin.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding electric utility operations.Jurisdictions - Electric utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount PercentIPL:           Iowa$1,295.5 50% $1,327.2 50% $1,386.0 52%Minnesota75.6 3% 81.1 3% 78.3 3%Subtotal1,371.1 53% 1,408.3 53% 1,464.3 55%WPL:           Wisconsin1,218.2 47% 1,227.5 47% 1,209.9 45% $2,589.3 100% $2,635.8 100% $2,674.2 100%The percentage of electric utility revenues regulated by the IUB, PSCW, MPUC and FERC were as follows: IPL WPL 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010IUB92% 90% 91% —% —% —%PSCW—% —% —% 86% 85% 84%MPUC5% 6% 5% —% —% —%FERC3% 4% 4% 14% 15% 16% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%Customers - The number of electric customers and communities served at December 31, 2012 was as follows: Retail Customers Wholesale Customers Other Customers Total Customers Communities ServedIPL526,841 8 1,373 528,222 752WPL458,180 21 2,245 460,446 606 985,021 29 3,618 988,668 1,358IPL and WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the food manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol) and paper industries.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB or MPUC that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and recovery of purchased electric capacity costs and other costs required to serve customers.  Prior to 2011, electric transmission service expenses were recovered from IPL’s retail electric customers in Iowa through changes in base rates.  Effective February 2011, electric transmission service expenses were removed from base rates and billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider.  This new cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to Iowa electric retail customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses.  IPL’s electric production fuel and energy purchases costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and recovery of electric production fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased 7Table of Contentselectric capacity costs, electric transmission service costs and other costs required to serve customers.  Effective January 1, 2011, WPL defers electric production fuel and energy purchases costs that exceed or fall below established fuel monitoring ranges through a new electric fuel cost recovery mechanism.  WPL’s recovery of deferred electric production fuel and energy purchases costs is restricted if it earns in excess of its authorized return on common equity.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of rate filings by WPL in 2012.Wholesale customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings.  The tariffs include an annual true-up process for actual costs incurred.  A significant majority of IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale service agreements have terms that end after 2016.In addition, WPL has bulk power customers, included in “Other customers” in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated, long-term customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.Seasonality - Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements.  In 2012, the maximum peak hour demands were as follows: Alliant Energy IPL WPLMW5,886 3,130 2,851DateJuly 25 July 25 July 5Competition - Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  However, IPL and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an effort to keep energy rates low for all.  Although electric service in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, owners of distributed generation, alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).In June 2010, the PSCW issued an order approving an economic development program effective July 2010, which is intended to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s service territory.  The program permits WPL to provide eligible industrial customers a discounted energy rate based upon specifically-defined conditions through December 2014.  To be eligible for the program, each customer needs to demonstrate that it is also eligible for direct governmental assistance through a local, state or federal economic development program, in addition to other criteria.  The discount amounts are limited to ensure recovery of marginal costs and will be decreased over time until a customer is paying the full tariff rate.  Currently, there are three WPL customers utilizing the economic development program.Renewable Energy Standards (RES) - As discussed in greater detail below, the states in which IPL and WPL operate have RES, which establish the amount of energy electric utilities or service providers must supply from renewable resources.IPL - IPL allocates its portfolio of renewable energy credits (RECs) between its Iowa and Minnesota jurisdictions based on a load-ratio share.  IPL has excess RECs in Iowa and a shortfall of RECs in Minnesota.  However, the excess RECs in Iowa are much larger than the Minnesota shortfall partially due to the relatively small amount of IPL’s load served in Minnesota compared to Iowa.  IPL’s surplus of RECs in Iowa could be used to meet the deficit of RECs in Minnesota.  IPL expects to meet both its Iowa and Minnesota renewable energy requirements on a system-wide basis without the need to purchase additional RECs.Iowa - IPL is required to purchase or own 50 MW of capacity from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in its service area.  IPL has met the Iowa requirement through 2012.Minnesota - A Minnesota RES was established in 2007 that requires IPL to supply a minimum level of its total Minnesota retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by certain future dates.  Based on this RES, IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with renewable energy sources must be at least 12% by 2012; 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020; and 25% by 2025.  Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES with renewable energy generated by the utility, renewable energy acquired under PPAs, or the use of accumulated or acquired RECs.  IPL currently expects to satisfy future Minnesota RES requirements with its current wind generation and wind PPAs, supplemented as needed by acquiring additional RECs from its Iowa excess supply.8Table of ContentsWPL - A Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was established in 2006 that requires electric utilities in Wisconsin, including WPL, to increase the portion of their total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in 2001, 2002 and 2003.  The RPS required a 2% increase above the benchmark by 2010 and will require a 6% increase above the benchmark by 2015.  Based on this RPS, WPL was required to supply a minimum of 5.28% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by 2010 and will be required to increase this amount to 9.28% by 2015.  Wisconsin utilities may reach the RPS with renewable energy generated by the utility, acquired under PPAs or through the use of renewable resource credits.  WPL has met the 2010 requirements of this RPS and currently expects to meet the 2015 requirements of the RPS with its current wind generation and wind PPAs.Energy Conservation - IPL and WPL continue to promote energy conservation, including their customers’ ability to efficiently manage their energy use.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Energy Efficiency Programs” in MDA for discussion of energy efficiency programs at IPL and WPL.Electric Supply - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have met historical customer demand of electricity and expect to continue meeting future demand through a mix of electric supply including internally generated electricity, PPAs and additional purchases from wholesale energy markets.  Alliant Energy’s mix of electric supply experienced changes in recent years with WPL’s purchases of the Neenah Energy Facility in 2009, Wisconsin Electric Power Company’s 25% interest in Edgewater Unit 5 in early 2011 and the Riverside Energy Center (Riverside) in the fourth quarter of 2012, the completion of wind projects including IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project in late 2009 and WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in early 2011, and IPL’s retirement of various electric generating units.  Alliant Energy expects its mix of electric supply to change further in the next several years with IPL’s proposed construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station, the decision not to renew WPL’s existing nuclear PPA beyond its December 2013 expiration date, and the proposed retirement of additional generating units.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically update their generation plans to identify longer term electric supply resource needs.  These long-term generation plans are intended to meet customer demand, reduce reliance on PPAs and wholesale market purchases and mitigate the impacts of future plant retirements while maintaining compliance with long-term electric demand planning reserve margins, environmental requirements and RES established by regulators.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to meet utility customer demand in the future.  However, unanticipated regional or local reliability issues could still arise in the event of unexpected delays in the construction of new generating and/or transmission facilities, retirement of generating facilities, generating facility outages, transmission system outages or extended periods of extreme weather conditions.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for a profile of the sources of electric supply used to meet customer demand for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL from 2008 to 2012.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Generation Plans” in MDA for details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s future generation plans.Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin (PRM) - IPL and WPL are required to maintain a PRM above their load at the time of the MISO-wide peak to ensure reliability of electric service to their customers.  The installed capacity reserve margin is 14.2% and the unforced capacity reserve margin is 6.2% for the June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014 MISO planning year.  IPL and WPL currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements.Effective for the June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014 MISO planning year, MISO implemented a Local Resource Zone (LRZ) concept.  The purpose of the LRZ concept is to encourage adequate generating resources adjacent to load served by such generating resources.  IPL is located in LRZ No. 3, which covers the entire state of Iowa and a portion of southern Minnesota.  WPL is located in LRZ No. 2, which covers the southern and eastern portions of Wisconsin and upper peninsula of Michigan.  Subject to certain zonal transfer capacity limits, load-serving utilities (including IPL and WPL) are permitted to have generating capacity located outside of their respective LRZs if they procure firm point-to-point transmission service to import the capacity from another LRZ.  If a utility chooses to import capacity from another LRZ without firm point-to-point transmission service, it will incur a zonal delivery charge.  Neither IPL or WPL have current generating capacity located outside of their respective LRZs; therefore they do not expect to be subject to zonal delivery charges during the June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014 MISO planning year.Generation - IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to Item 2 Properties for details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating stations.Generating Capacity - The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating facilities is based upon MISO’s resource adequacy process, which uses the unforced capacity of the generating facilities.  The generating capacity for the June 2012 to May 2013 planning period by fuel type in MWs was as follows:9Table of Contents IPL WPL TotalCoal1,304 1,348 2,652Natural gas (a)820 1,183 2,003Oil242 — 242Wind (b)— 7 7Total2,366 2,538 4,904(a)In December 2012, WPL purchased Riverside, a 600 MW natural gas-fired electric generating facility.  WPL was credited 572 MW of capacity for this facility during the period from February 2013 to May 2013 based upon the MISO resource adequacy process.  WPL is utilizing 497 MW of the accredited capacity from Riverside to satisfy its PRM requirements and has sold 75 MW of the accredited capacity to a third-party with a PPA.(b)As of December 31, 2012, completed wind projects owned by Alliant Energy’s regulated utilities included IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa, WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin and WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota.  The amounts in the table above represent 0%, 10% and 0% of the capacity of IPL’s Whispering Willow - East, WPL’s Cedar Ridge and WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind projects, respectively, based upon the MISO resource adequacy process, which is determined separately for each wind site, during the planning period from June 2012 to May 2013.Fuel Costs - The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric generation was as follows: IPL WPL 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010All fuels$2.26 $2.18 $2.17 $2.26 $2.28 $2.17Coal1.91 1.86 1.73 2.21 2.22 2.06Natural gas (a)3.79 7.17 9.79 3.21 6.30 12.83(a)The average cost of natural gas includes commodity and transportation costs as well as gains and losses from swap and option contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by Alliant Energy’s natural gas-fired electric generating facilities.Coal - Coal is the primary fuel source for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally generated electric supply and represented approximately 40% to 50% of their total sources of electric energy in 2012.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2013 through 2017.  As of December 31, 2012, existing contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 77%, 44%, 36%, 9% and 7% of IPL’s and WPL’s estimated aggregate coal supply needs for 2013 through 2017, respectively.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe this portfolio of coal supplies represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL expect to meet remaining coal requirements from either future term contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Alliant Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters into various coal transportation agreements to meet its coal supply requirements.  As of December 31, 2012, existing coal transportation agreements cover approximately 100%, 95% and 14% of IPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2013 through 2015, respectively, and 100%, 100% and 31% of WPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2013 through 2015, respectively.Nearly all of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating stations, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply targets of 25 to 55 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations with seasonal deliveries.  Actual inventory averages for 2012 were 54 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 114 days for generating stations with seasonal deliveries.  The average days on hand were computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by estimated average daily tons burned.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically test coal from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which alternative sources of coal are most compatible with their generating stations.  Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to provide Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL with further protection against interruptions and lessen their dependence on their primary coal source.Average delivered fossil fuel costs are expected to increase in the future due to price structures and adjustment provisions in existing coal contracts, rate structures and adjustment provisions in existing transportation contracts, fuel-related surcharges 10Table of Contentsincorporated by transportation carriers and expected future coal and transportation market trends.  Existing coal commodity contracts with terms of greater than one year have fixed future year prices that generally reflect recent market trends.  One of Alliant Energy’s existing coal contracts contain provisions for price adjustments should specific indices change beyond a certain threshold.  Rate adjustment provisions in older transportation contracts are primarily based on changes in the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor as published by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.  Rate adjustment provisions in more recent transportation contracts are based on changes in the All Inclusive Index Less Fuel as published by the Association of American Railroads.  These more recent transportation contracts also contain fuel surcharges that are subject to change monthly based on changes in diesel fuel prices.  Other factors that may impact coal prices for future commitments are increasing costs for supplier mineral rights, increasing costs to mine the coal and changes in various associated laws and regulations.  For example, emission restrictions related to sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and mercury, along with other environmental limitations on generating stations, continue to increase and will likely limit the ability to obtain, and further increase the cost of, adequate coal supplies.  Factors that may impact future transportation rates include, but are not limited to: the need for railroads to enhance/expand infrastructure for demand growth, corresponding investments in locomotives and crews, and the desire to improve margins on coal movements commensurate with margins on non-coal movements.Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms.  Alliant Energy’s coal procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier diversity.  Similarly, given the term lengths of their transportation agreements, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believes they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.Natural Gas - Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities including IPL’s 565 MW Emery Generating Station, WPL’s 300 MW Neenah Energy Facility, WPL’s 600 MW Riverside Generating Station and Resources’ 300 MW Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility.  WPL has exclusive rights to the output of the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under an affiliated lease agreement.  These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands and when natural gas prices are low enough to make natural gas-fired generation economical compared to other fuel sources.  Internally generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities represented less than 5% to 10% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2012.  Alliant Energy manages the gas supply to these gas-fired generating facilities and provides supply through a combination of third-party deliveries and pipeline transportation and storage contracts held by IPL and WPL.Wind - IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa began generating electricity in 2009.  WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began generating electricity in 2008.  WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota began full generation of electricity in early 2011.  Internally generated electric supply from wind facilities represented less than 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2012.  All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be used in future years to comply with RES or other regulatory requirements, or sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities.Purchased Power - IPL and WPL periodically enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for electricity.  Purchased power represented approximately 40% to 45% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2012.  IPL’s most significant PPA is with NER for the purchase of energy and capacity from the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) through February 2014.  In January 2013, the IUB issued an order allowing IPL to proceed with a proposed DAEC PPA, which will provide IPL 431 MWs of capacity and the resulting energy from DAEC for a term from the expiration of the existing PPA in February 2014 through December 31, 2025.  WPL’s most significant PPA is with Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) for the purchase of energy and capacity from the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) through December 2013.  In October 2012, Dominion announced plans to shut down Kewaunee in the second quarter of 2013.  WPL currently expects that Dominion will provide WPL replacement energy and capacity under the terms of the Kewaunee PPA after the plant is shut down through the end of the PPA term in December 2013.  As a result, WPL currently expects no material changes to the expected energy and capacity payments under the PPA.Refer to Note 1(h) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of electric production fuel and purchased energy costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding PPAs accounted for as operating leases and Note 13(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments in the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”11Table of ContentsElectric Transmission -IPL - IPL completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois to ITC in 2007.  ITC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  IPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ITC.  The annual transmission service rates that ITC charges its customers is calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.”  Refer to “Other Future Considerations - Electric Transmission Service Charges” in MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ITC.  Refer to “Rate Matters - Recent Retail Base Rate Filings - IPL’s Iowa Retail Electric Rate Case (2009 Test Year)” in MDA for discussion of a transmission cost rider approved by the IUB in January 2011 for recovery of IPL’s electric transmission service expenses.WPL - WPL transferred its transmission assets to ATC in 2001 in exchange for an ownership interest in ATC.  As of December 31, 2012, WPL held a 16% ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $257 million.  WPL’s investment in ATC generated equity income of $41 million in 2012 for Alliant Energy and WPL.  During 2012, ATC distributed to WPL, in the form of dividends, $33 million or approximately 80% of WPL’s equity earnings from ATC.  Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC will continue a dividend payout ratio close to this level in the future.  WPL currently anticipates making capital contributions of $4 million, $2 million and $20 million to ATC in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, to maintain its current ownership percentage and help fund future proposed transmission projects  These future proposed transmission projects require approval from various regulatory agencies to construct.  Certain of these future proposed transmission projects are currently being challenged by other utilities and other transmission-only companies who have requested to own a portion of the future transmission projects proposed by ATC.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine the impact these challenges may have on ATC’s plans to construct these proposed transmission projects and the resulting impact on their future capital contributions to ATC and equity earnings income and dividends received from ATC.ATC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  ATC has transmission interconnections with various other transmission owning utilities in the Midwest.  These interconnections enhance the overall reliability of the WPL delivery system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and emergency energy.  WPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ATC.  The annual transmission service rates that ATC charges its customers are calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.”  Refer to “Other Future Considerations - Electric Transmission Service Charges” in MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ATC.In 2011, Duke Energy Corporation and ATC announced the creation of Duke-American Transmission Co. (DATC), a joint venture that is expected to build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America.  In 2011, DATC announced its first set of transmission projects, which include seven new transmission lines in five Midwestern states to be constructed over the next 10 years for an aggregate cost of approximately $4 billion.  These transmission projects are subject to approval by various regulatory agencies.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine what impacts the joint venture and transmission line projects noted above, if constructed, will have on their future equity income, distributions from ATC, capital contributions to ATC, or ownership in ATC.Refer to Note 19 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of agreements between ATC and WPL.MISO Markets - IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, which is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories.  IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are discussed in more detail below.  IPL and WPL are parties to a system coordination and operating agreement whereby Corporate Services serves as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL.  The agreement, which has been approved or reviewed by FERC and all state regulatory bodies having jurisdiction, provides a contractual basis for coordinated planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the interconnected electric generation systems of IPL and WPL.  As agent of the agreement, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission service sale and purchase transactions.  Corporate Services allocates such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on information provided by MISO and procedures included in the agreement.  Refer to Note 19 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of these allocated amounts.Wholesale Energy Market - IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO in 2005.  The market dictates the process by which IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load.  In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/12Table of Contentsor real-time bids and offers for energy.  MISO evaluates IPL’s, WPL’s and other market participants’ offers, bids and energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders about where generation or transmission system expansion is needed.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated based on economic needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for their variable costs.  IPL and WPL also periodically engage in related transactions in PJM’s bid/offer-based wholesale energy market, which are accounted for in a similar manner as the MISO transactions.Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) and Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) - In areas of constrained transmission capacity, costs could be higher due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  As part of the MISO market restructuring in 2005, physical transmission rights of IPL and WPL were replaced with FTRs.  FTRs provide a hedge for congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market.  MISO allocates ARRs to IPL and WPL each year based on historical use of the transmission system.  The revenue rights associated with the allocated ARRs are used by IPL and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by MISO.  MISO allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31.  IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through May 31, 2013.Ancillary Services Market - IPL and WPL began participating in MISO’s ancillary services market that was launched in 2009.  The ancillary services market integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market implemented in 2005.  Regulation reserves refer to generation available to meet the moment-to-moment changes in generation that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand.  Contingency reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either on-line or that can be brought on-line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major events such as the loss of a large generating unit or transmission line.Multi-Value Projects (MVPs) - MISO tariffs billed to IPL and WPL include costs related to various shared transmission projects including MVPs.  MVPs include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates, reduce market congestion or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within MISO.  MVP costs are socialized across the entire MISO footprint based on energy usage of each MISO participant.  MISO tariffs billed to IPL and WPL also include costs related to other shared transmission projects, including projects designed to reduce market congestion, provide interconnection service to the transmission grid for new generation, and to ensure compliance with applicable standards.  The costs of these projects are allocated to MISO participants in a way that is commensurate with the benefit to the participants’ pricing zone.  The MISO transmission charges billed to IPL and WPL are expected to increase in the future due to the increased number of shared transmission projects occurring in the MISO region.Attachment Y Notices and System Support Resources (SSR) - MISO requires its market participants (including IPL and WPL, among others) who own electric generating facilities to submit an Attachment Y Notice if they plan to retire a facility or suspend operations of a facility for a period longer than two months.  Pursuant to receiving an Attachment Y Notice, MISO will conduct a study to determine whether all or a portion of the facility’s capacity is necessary to maintain system reliability.  If the facility’s capacity is determined to be necessary to maintain system reliability, MISO designates the facility as an SSR.  If the facility’s owner accepts the SSR designation, the facility’s owner negotiates with MISO an annual revenue requirement designed to cover the future costs of maintaining availability of the SSR.  The annual revenue requirement determined for each SSR is subject to FERC approval.  The annual revenue requirement for the SSR is assigned to certain load serving entities based on a MISO study.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to estimate the amount of future SSR charges that may be assigned to IPL and WPL as load serving entities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are also currently unable to estimate the impacts of any potential SSR designations on electric generating facilities they plan to retire.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Generation Plans” in MDA for discussion of electric generating facilities that IPL and WPL currently plan to retire.Electric Environmental Matters - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at a federal, state and local level relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing air emissions; water discharges; the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials; and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  The laws impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s electric operations include, but are not limited to, the Safe Drinking Water Act; Clean Water Act; Clean Air Act; National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986; Endangered Species Act; Occupational Safety and Health Act; National Energy Policy Act, as amended; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; 13Table of ContentsPollution Prevention Act; and Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, as well as similar state laws, and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL regularly obtain federal, state and local permits to assure compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the future.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL anticipate that prudently incurred compliance and remediation costs for IPL and WPL will be recoverable, in whole or part, through future rate case proceedings.  Refer to “Environmental Matters” in MDA and Note 13(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of electric environmental matters, including current or proposed environmental regulations.

Alliant Energy’s gas utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing gas service in Iowa and southern Minnesota, and WPL providing gas service in southern and central Wisconsin.  Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas utility operations.Jurisdictions - Gas utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount PercentIPL:           Iowa$216.6 55% $263.3 55% $261.5 54%Minnesota10.1 2% 13.0 3% 12.8 3%Subtotal226.7 57% 276.3 58% 274.3 57%WPL:           Wisconsin169.6 43% 200.4 42% 206.3 43% $396.3 100% $476.7 100% $480.6 100%Customers - The number of gas customers and communities served at December 31, 2012 were as follows: Retail Transportation / Total Communities Customers Other Customers Customers ServedIPL233,820 334 234,154 243WPL181,028 240 181,268 239 414,848 574 415,422 482IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB, MPUC or PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in gas infrastructure and recovery of costs required to serve customers.  Commodity, storage and transportation costs incurred by IPL and WPL are recovered pursuant to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms.  In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s recent retail gas rate cases.Seasonality - Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in underground storage fields and deliver it in the winter.Competition - Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third parties.  It remains uncertain if, and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.Gas Supply - IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 70 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada.  The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through March 2015.  IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily market-based.In more recent years, natural gas prices have fallen to levels not seen in a decade.  Prices have fallen largely due to surging supply caused by shale gas production.  Given the tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates in the cost of gas sold, the decreased natural gas prices do not have a material impact on their respective gas margins.In providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG), ANR Pipeline (ANR), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (NGPL), Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) and 17Table of ContentsNorthern Border Pipeline (NBPL) allow access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory.  In 2012, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as follows in dekatherms (Dths)): NNG ANR NGPL FCS Guardian NBPL TotalIPL191,669 43,180 78,585 14,000 — 4,085 331,519WPL76,056 167,467 — — 10,000 — 253,523Refer to Note 1(h) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery mechanisms and Note 13(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments in the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”Gas Environmental Matters - Alliant Energy is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at a federal, state and local level relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, as well as those governing air emissions, water discharges, and the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  The laws impacting Alliant Energy’s gas operations include, but are not limited to, the Safe Drinking Water Act; Clean Water Act; National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986; Endangered Species Act; Occupational Safety and Health Act; National Energy Policy Act, as amended; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; Pollution Prevention Act, and Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, as well as similar state laws, and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Alliant Energy regularly obtains federal, state and local permits to assure compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the future.  Alliant Energy anticipates that prudently incurred compliance and remediation costs for IPL and WPL will be recoverable, in whole or part, through future rate case proceedings.

Our operations are also governed by organizations such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and MISO.  Operations impacted by these regulatory groups include: the rates charged to our customers; our ability to site and construct new generating facilities, such as the proposed natural gas generating facility in Iowa and future wind projects to utilize our remaining available wind sites, and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; the installation of environmental emission controls equipment and the amount of costs for the construction and maintenance of such equipment that may be recovered from customers; our ability to decommission generating facilities and recover the costs incurred to decommission the facilities and the remaining carrying value of such facilities; the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources and reductions in energy usage by customers; our ability to purchase generating facilities and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; the rates paid to transmission operators and the amount of those costs, and how those costs, are recovered from customers; our ability to enter into purchased power agreements, such as the purchased power agreement entered into with NextEra Energy, Inc., and the amount of costs associated therewith, and how those costs are recovered from customers; energy capacity standards and what forms of energy are considered when determining whether we meet those standards; the allocation of expenditures by transmission companies on transmission upgrades and our ability to recover costs associated therewith from customers; safety; the issuance of securities; accounting matters; and transactions between affiliates.  These regulatory authorities are also empowered to impose financial penalties and other sanctions if we are found to have violated statutes and regulations governing utility operations.  Failure to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities for any of these matters, failure to receive approvals in a timely manner, or receiving approvals with uneconomical conditions may adversely impact our ability to achieve our strategic plan, cause us to record an impairment of our assets, and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, our utility financial condition is influenced by how these regulatory authorities establish the rates we can charge our customers, our authorized rates of return and common equity levels, and the amount of deferred costs that may be recovered from customers.  Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to earn authorized rates of return depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or 20Table of Contentsauthorized rates of return on capital will be earned.  In pending and future rate cases, IPL and WPL may not receive an adequate amount of rate relief, rates may be reduced, rate refunds may be required, rate adjustments may not be approved on a timely basis, costs may not be otherwise recovered through rates, future rates may be temporarily frozen (as is the case for IPL’s retail electric base rates through 2013 and WPL’s retail electric and gas base rates through 2014) and authorized rates of return on capital may be reduced.  As a result, we may experience adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.  We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from future regulatory activities of any of these agencies.We are subject to a wide variety of regulations, including and in addition to those described above, which are constantly changing.  Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional costs or change business operations or our business plan, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  While we believe we comply with all laws and regulations governing us, state or federal agencies may not agree and may find that our compliance programs are inadequate.  Such a finding could cause fines or penalties or could require us to implement new compliance programs, which could increase our costs of compliance and may adversely impact our financial condition.Provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act (WUHCA) limit our ability to invest in non-utility activities.  Takeover attempts by potential purchasers who might be willing to pay a premium for our stock are also limited by certain provisions of WUHCA and the delays and conditions that generally result from the requirement that regulatory authorities approve such a transaction.Large construction projects are subject to delays and cost increases that may not be recovered from customers - Our strategic plan includes installing environmental control equipment, making other large-scale improvements to our newer and more-efficient coal-fired generating facilities, and construction of a natural gas-fired generating facility.  These large construction projects are subject to various risks that could cause costs to increase or cause delays in completion.  These risks include changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities, fuel or labor; shortages in materials, equipment and qualified labor; changes to the scope or timing of the projects; general contractors or subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts; the inability to agree to contract terms or disputes in contract terms; poor initial cost estimates; work stoppages; adverse weather conditions; the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; governmental actions; legal action; unforeseen engineering or technology issues; limited access to capital and other adverse economic conditions.  If a construction project is not completed or is delayed, or final costs exceed the costs approved by our regulators, we may not be able to recover all costs for the project in rates and we face increased risk of potential impairment of our investment in the project.  Inability to recover costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which could be difficult and costly - We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, cooling water intake structures, wastewater discharges, the generation, transport and disposal of coal combustion products and other solid wastes and hazardous substances, and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals, which are subject to renewal proceedings and legal challenges.  Environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels, to install emission control equipment at our facilities, clean up spills and correct environmental hazards and other contamination.  We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate (i.e., clean-up) sites where our past activities, or the activities of certain other parties, caused environmental contamination, including sites of former manufactured gas plants operated by our predecessors.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant down-times and can negatively affect the affordability of rates we charge our customers.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of any fines or penalties, including the severity of any restriction on our operations) necessary to comply with, or as a result of liabilities under, these environmental laws and regulations, although we expect the expenditures to be material.Although we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we may receive notices of violation from state or federal agencies, as occurred when the EPA issued a notice of violation to WPL in 2009 alleging non-compliance with various permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act.  Citizen groups or private individuals that feel environmental regulations are not being sufficiently enforced by regulatory agencies may bring legal action against those regulatory agencies or bring citizen enforcement actions against us.  We may be subject to litigation over environmental issues, including claims for property damage or personal injury, or suits by citizen groups alleging violations of 21Table of Contentsenvironmental requirements.  For example, WPL is currently involved in matters in which the Sierra Club is alleging various violations of the Clean Air Act.  If we are unsuccessful defending litigation from governmental agencies or citizen groups, we could be subject to restrictions or prohibitions on operating our generation facilities, costly upgrades to our generating facilities, payment of damages or fines, requirements to complete other beneficial environmental projects, and litigation costs, all of which could be material.  An adverse result in such legal actions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to existing and potential future governmental mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings.  These mandates are designed in part to mitigate the potential environmental impacts of utility operations.  Failure to meet the requirements of these mandates may result in fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to us.  These revised and new laws or regulations may include regulation of mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions, particulates, coal ash and other coal combustion products, and cooling water intake structures.  Such changes could materially increase our cost of compliance.  Our strategic plan was developed in part to comply with certain expected environmental laws and regulations as we anticipate they will be finally adopted.  Revision of existing environmental laws or regulations may cause: (1) state utility commissions to not approve our plans to install environmental emission control equipment at our existing generating facilities or not allow us to recover costs of such projects; (2) state utility commissions to not approve costs of emission allowances purchased to comply with environmental regulations that are no longer applicable to our operations; (3) co-owners in our jointly-owned facilities to not agree with our decision to move forward with these projects; or (4) our current plans to not meet new requirements.  These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Actions related to global climate change and reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions could negatively impact us - The primary GHG emitted from our utility operations is CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels at our generating facilities, which are primarily coal-fired facilities.  We could incur costs or other obligations to comply with any GHG regulations that are adopted in the future, and could become the target of legal claims or challenges, because generating electricity using fossil fuels emits CO2 and other GHGs.  Due to the uncertainty of what form CO2 emissions regulations could take, control technologies available to reduce GHG emissions, including CO2, and the unknown nature of potential compliance obligations should climate change regulations be enacted, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts any future regulations would have on our operations.  The impacts of such proposals could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Demand for energy may decrease - Adverse economic conditions in our service territories, such as the most recent recession, reduce the demand for electricity and natural gas.  We lost certain customers after plants closed due to the most recent recession and could lose additional customers due to economic conditions, customers constructing their own generation facilities, or loss of service territory or franchises.  Further, the energy conservation and technological advances that increase energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for energy products.  In addition, state and/or federal regulations require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for energy.  We may also lose wholesale customers to competitors.  Future economic growth may not create enough growth for us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers.  The loss of customers, the inability to replace those customers with new customers, and the decrease in demand for energy could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by the impacts of weather - Our electric and gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance.  Demand for electricity is greater in the summer months associated with higher air conditioning needs.  In addition, market prices for electricity generally peak in the summer due to the higher demand.  Conversely, demand for natural gas depends significantly upon weather patterns in winter months due to heavy use in residential and commercial heating.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, we have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Thus, unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.22Table of ContentsThreats of terrorism, cyber attacks, and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism and cyber attacks may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - We are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Generation and transmission facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets of both physical and cyber attacks.  The risks posed by such attacks could include, among other things, the disruption of, volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, the increased cost of security and insurance; an adverse effect on our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources, and significantly slow growth or a decline in the economy within our service territories, all of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the cost of repairing damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure due to acts of terrorism, and the loss of revenue if such events prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, an attack could result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  We have instituted safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets.  FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to prevent cyber attacks.  The safeguards we have may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber security.  We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.  If the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised.In connection with our business, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareowners and employees.  Our customers, shareowners and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or other data by cyber attack or otherwise could result in significant costs, fines or litigation, could adversely impact our reputation, and could adversely impact our financial condition.We may not be able to fully recover costs related to commodity and transmission prices - The prices that we may obtain for electric energy may not compensate for changes in delivered coal, natural gas or electric energy spot-market costs, or changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of electric energy.  As a result, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers, especially at WPL where we do not have a retail electric automatic fuel cost adjustment clause, which allows more consistent and timely cost recovery.  We are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because the majority of the electricity generated by us is from our coal-fired generating facilities.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply and transportation of coal for most of our existing generating capability, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Further, we currently rely on coal primarily from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region may cause us to incur additional costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We also have responsibility to supply natural gas to certain natural gas-fired electric generating facilities that we own, which increases our exposure to volatile market prices of natural gas.  We have natural gas supply contracts in place, which are generally short-term in duration.  The natural gas supply commitments are either fixed price in nature or market-based.  As some of the contracts are market-based, and all of the contracts are short-term, we may not be able to purchase natural gas on terms as favorable as the current contracts when the current contracts expire.  Further, any disruption of production or transportation of natural gas may cause us to incur additional costs to purchase natural gas that may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates.  The prices that we charge for electric energy may not compensate for changes in transmission costs.  As a result, we may be unable to pass on the changes in transmission costs to our customers, especially at WPL where we do not have a retail automatic transmission rider.  If the transmission rider at IPL is amended or removed, we may not be able to recover the full transmission costs.  Inability to fully recover transmission costs in a timely manner may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We face risks related to non-regulated operations - We rely on our non-regulated operations for a portion of our earnings.  If our non-regulated investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings.  In particular, Franklin County Wind LLC is a non-regulated subsidiary that operates a non-regulated 100 MW wind project in Franklin County, Iowa, referred to as the Franklin County wind project.  The Franklin County wind project does not currently have a buyer of its electrical output and its electrical output is being sold into the general market at prevailing market prices.  Failure to find a buyer for the output, or selling the output at disadvantageous market prices, may cause the project to lose money or 23Table of Contentscause an impairment of its assets.  Such losses or impairments could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on the capital markets and could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the capital markets - Successful implementation of our strategic plan and other long-term business strategies is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates.  We have forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion over the next four years.  In 2011, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S.  More recently, U.S. debt ceiling and fiscal policy concerns, together with continued signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in Europe, could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions.  In turn, any national economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could reduce our access to capital necessary to execute our strategic plan and for our operations as we may be unable to access the credit markets or may face significantly higher costs of borrowing.  We rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit markets.  If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, we could pay higher interest rates in future financings, the pool of potential lenders could be reduced, borrowing costs under existing credit facilities could increase, our access to the commercial paper market could be limited, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties.  If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.We are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses - We are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of and our ability to recruit qualified personnel that could affect our businesses and our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, our workforce includes employees who are nearing retirement.  We need employees with specialized and technical skills in order to achieve our strategic plan.  It may be difficult to retain current employees with these specialized skills, especially as they near retirement, and it may be difficult to find new employees with the necessary skills.  We are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with approximately 2,200 employees.  Our contract with one union representing over 700 of our employees is due to expire in August 2013.  Any work stoppage experienced in connections with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to implement our strategic plan.We face risks associated with operating electric and natural gas infrastructure - The operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, the dependence on a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, operator error and compliance with mandatory reliability standards.  The operation of our energy delivery infrastructure involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment and forest or prairie fires developing from vegetation around our power lines.  In addition, the North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an extensive power outage in our delivery systems.  Further, the transmission system in our utilities’ service territories is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within our service territories.  The transmission constraints could result in an inability to deliver energy from generating facilities, particularly wind generating facilities, to the national grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy.  We also have obligations to provide electrical service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The operation of our natural gas distribution activities also involves many risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses.  These risks could result in loss of human life, particularly in highly populated areas, significant damage to property, environmental emissions, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  We are also responsible for compliance with new and changing mandatory reliability and safety standards.  Failure to meet these standards could result in substantial fines.  We also have obligations to provide service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Storms or other natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - Storms and other natural disasters, including events such as floods, tornadoes, blizzards, ice storms, or droughts may adversely impact our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources and may significantly slow growth or cause a decline in the economy within our service territories.  Storms and natural disasters may prevent our customers from being able to operate, causing lower sales and revenues, which may not be replaced or recovered in rates.  In addition, we could incur large costs to repair damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure, or costs related to environmental remediation, due to storms or natural disasters.  The restoration costs may not be fully covered by insurance policies.  Damage to assets could also require 24Table of Contentsus to take impairments, such as occurred with our damaged Sixth Street Generating Station after a flood.  Some costs may not be recovered in rates, or there could be significant delays in cost recovery.  Any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may incur material post-closing adjustments related to past asset and business divestitures - We recently sold RMT, Inc. (RMT), a non-regulated subsidiary.  Pursuant to the terms of that sale, we may face unfavorable post-closing adjustments that could be material.  In addition, we might be required to make payments on liabilities that we retained pursuant to the terms of the sale.  In addition, Alliant Energy continues to guarantee RMT’s performance obligations related to certain of RMT’s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy’s sale of RMT.  Required material post-closing adjustments or payments on retained liabilities or guarantees with respect to RMT or other future asset or business divestitures could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends - Alliant Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own.  Accordingly, the primary sources of funds for Alliant Energy to pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, primarily its utility subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on Alliant Energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations and the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries.  Our utilities each have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of their outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations applicable to them.  If we do not receive adequate dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, then we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on Alliant Energy common stock.Changes to certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations - We have significantly reduced our federal and state income tax obligations for the past few years through tax planning strategies.  These tax planning strategies have generated large annual taxable losses and tax credits over the past few years that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses (NOL) and federal tax credit carryforwards.  We plan to utilize these NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our income tax obligations.  If we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before they expire, we may incur material charges to earnings.  If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not agree with the deductions resulting from our tax planning strategies, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.  We are also expecting the IRS will publish guidance in the future which may compel us to change our tax methods of accounting related to certain of these tax planning strategies.  Changes in our tax methods of accounting to comply with updated guidance could result in fewer deductions and material charges to our earnings due to the accounting impacts of rate making practices in Iowa, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our utility business currently operates wind generating facilities which generate material production tax credits for us to use to reduce our federal tax obligations.  The amount of production tax credits we earn is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by our wind projects.  Significant transmission constraints, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by our wind projects resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Lastly, if corporate tax rates were changed with future federal or state legislation, we may be required to take material charges against earnings.Poor performance of pension and other postretirement plan investments could negatively impact our financial condition - We have pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to a large portion of our employees and retirees.  Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans.  The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment.  The recent recession and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have affected the asset values of our pension plans.  Future losses of asset values may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements.  Downward pressure on the asset values of our pension plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Energy industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses - We operate in a highly regulated business environment.  The advent of new and unregulated markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial condition 25Table of Contentsand results of operations.  The evolution of the wholesale and transmission markets has the potential to significantly increase costs of transmission, costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, costs of participation in the new markets and costs stemming from estimated payment settlements.  Competitive pressures, including advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in our utilities losing market share and customers and incurring stranded costs (i.e., assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable through customer rates as a result of competitive pricing), which would be borne by our shareowners.  Increased competition from any restructuring efforts in our primary retail electric service territories may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.ITEM 1B
