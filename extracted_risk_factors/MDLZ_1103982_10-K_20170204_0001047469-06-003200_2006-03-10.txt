Discussion and Analysis  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Company's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, the Company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 

        The
preparation of all financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company's financial statements, including, among
other things, employee benefit costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately
different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for 

22




 


the
period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between the Company's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact
on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

        The
selection and disclosure of the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Company's Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more
significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements: 

        Employee Benefit Plans.    As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides a range
of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). The Company records amounts relating to
these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover
rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed
appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its
obligations under its plans, which are presented in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonable based on its experience and advice from its actuaries. 


        During
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded the following amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings for employee benefit plans:

        The
2005 net expense for employee benefit plans of $882 million increased by $247 million over the 2004 amount. The cost increase primarily relates to higher U.S. pension
plan costs, including higher amortization of the unrecognized net loss from experience differences, a lower expected return on plan assets, a lower discount rate assumption and higher settlement
losses as employees retired or left during 2005. The 2004 net expense for employee benefit plans of $635 million increased by $288 million over the 2003 amount. This cost increase
primarily relates to increased postemployment benefit costs, resulting from several workforce reduction programs during 2004 as part of the overall restructuring program ($167 million), and a
lowering of the Company's discount rate
assumption on its pension and postretirement benefit plans, partially offset by the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 discussed below. 

        In
December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act establishes a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, known as "Medicare Part D," and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. 

        In
May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of the subsidy on benefits
attributable to past service as an actuarial experience gain and as 

23




 


a
reduction of the service cost component of net postretirement health care costs for amounts attributable to current service, if the benefit provided is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. 

        The
Company adopted FSP 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004. The impact for 2005 and 2004 was a reduction of pre-tax net postretirement health care costs and an
increase in net earnings of $55 million and $24 million, respectively. In addition, as of July 1, 2004, the Company reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service by $315 million and decreased its unrecognized actuarial losses by the same amount. 

        At
December 31, 2005, for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company reduced its discount rate assumption from 5.75% to 5.60%. The Company presently anticipates that
assumption changes, coupled with the amortization of deferred gains and losses will result in an increase in 2006 pre-tax benefit expense of approximately $80 million, or
approximately $0.03 per share. The expected increase in benefit expense is prior to the consideration of any impact of the expanded restructuring program. While the Company does not presently
anticipate a change in its 2006 assumptions, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point decline (increase) in the Company's discount rate would increase (decrease) the Company's U.S. pension and
postretirement expense by approximately $72 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) the Company's pension
expense for the U.S. pension plans by approximately $31 million. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend
rates. 

        Revenue Recognition.    As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives, and including
shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment or
delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. Provisions and allowances for estimated sales returns and bad
debts are also recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The amounts recorded for these provisions and related allowances are not significant to the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations. 

        Depreciation, Amortization and Goodwill Valuation.    The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes
definite life intangibles using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

        The
Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying
value and fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows. Impairment testing for non-amortizable intangible assets requires a comparison between
the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. These calculations may be
affected by the market conditions noted below in the Business Environment section, as well as interest rates, general economic conditions and projected growth rates. During the first quarter of 2005,
the Company completed its annual review of goodwill and intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted from this review. However, as part of the sale or pending sale of certain Canadian assets
and two brands, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charges of $269 million in 2005, which included impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of
$13 million and $118 million, respectively, as well as $138 million of asset write-downs. During 2004, the Company's annual review of goodwill and intangible assets resulted in a
$29 million non-cash pre-tax charge related to an intangible asset impairment for a small confectionery business in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A
portion of this charge, $17 million, was reclassified to earnings from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004. 

24




 


The
remaining charge was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. 


        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted
operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. These analyses are affected by interest rates, general economic conditions and projected growth rates. For purposes of recognition
and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined
to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of
disposal. 

        Marketing and Advertising Costs.    As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company records marketing costs as an expense in the year to
which such costs relate. The Company does not defer amounts on its year-end consolidated balance sheet with respect to marketing costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally
on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated
volume and related expense for the full year. 

        Related Party Transactions.    As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Altria
Group, Inc.'s subsidiary, Altria Corporate Services, Inc., provides the Company with various services, including planning, legal, treasury, auditing, insurance, human resources, office
of the secretary, corporate affairs, information technology, aviation and tax services. Billings for these services, which were based on the cost to Altria Corporate Services, Inc. to provide
such services and a management fee, were $237 million, $310 million and $318 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
performed at a similar cost various functions in 2005 that previously had been provided by Altria Corporate Services, Inc., resulting in a lower service charge in 2005. These costs were paid to
Altria Corporate Services, Inc. monthly. Although the cost of these services cannot be quantified on a stand-alone basis, management has assessed that the billings are reasonable based on the
level of support provided by Altria Corporate Services, Inc., and that they reflect all services provided. The cost and nature of the services are reviewed annually by the Company's Audit
Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The effects of these transactions are included in operating cash flows in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. 


        During
2005, the Company repatriated certain foreign earnings as part of Altria Group, Inc.'s dividend repatriation plan under provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
Increased taxes for this repatriation of $21 million, were reimbursed by Altria Group, Inc. The reimbursement was reported in the Company's financial statements as an increase to
additional paid-in capital. 

        In
December 2005, the Company purchased an airport hangar and certain personal property located at the hangar in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from Altria Corporate Services, Inc.
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.3 million. 

        In
December 2004, the Company purchased two corporate aircraft from Altria Corporate Services, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $47 million. The
Company also entered into an Aircraft Management Agreement with Altria Corporate Services, Inc. in December 2004, pursuant to which Altria Corporate Services, Inc. agreed to
perform aircraft management, pilot services, maintenance and other aviation services for the Company. 

        At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. of $652 million and $227 million, respectively.
The amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. 

25




 


generally
include accrued dividends, taxes and service fees. The increase from 2004 primarily reflects the timing of payments. Interest on intercompany borrowings is based on the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate. 

        Income Taxes.    The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The U.S. accounts of the Company are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Altria Group, Inc. Income taxes are generally
computed on a separate company basis. To the extent that foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot currently be utilized on a separate company basis,
are utilized in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return, the benefit is recognized in the calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. Based on the Company's
current estimate, this benefit is calculated to be approximately $225 million, $70 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase in 2005 is driven primarily by dividend repatriations and certain legal entity reorganizations. The benefit is dependent on a variety of tax attributes that have a tendency
to vary year to year. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Altria Group, Inc. for the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal
income tax return including current taxes payable and net changes in tax provisions. The provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning
opportunities available to the Company in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company
establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that existing tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that
may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company evaluates and potentially adjusts these provisions in light of changing facts and circumstances. The consolidated tax provision includes
the impact of changes to accruals that are considered appropriate. Upon the closure of current and future tax audits in various jurisdictions, significant income tax accrual reversals could continue
to occur, which could trigger cash reimbursements from Altria Group, Inc. 

        In
October, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("the Jobs Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Act includes a deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. In
2005, the Company repatriated approximately $500 million of earnings under the provisions of the Jobs Act. Deferred taxes had previously been provided for a portion of the dividends to be
remitted. The reversal of the deferred taxes more than offset the tax costs to repatriate the earnings and resulted in a net tax reduction of $28 million in the consolidated income tax
provision during 2005, the majority of which was recorded during the second quarter. 

        The
Jobs Act also provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction related to a percentage of the lesser of "qualified production activities income" or
taxable income. The deduction, which was 3% in 2005, increases to 9% by 2010. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
the Company will recognize these benefits in the year earned. The tax benefit in 2005 was approximately $25 million. 


        The
Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and these audits are at various stages at any given time. The Company anticipates several domestic and
foreign audits will close in 2006 with expected favorable settlements. Any tax contingency reserves in excess of additional assessed liabilities will be reversed at the time the audits close. 

        Consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which Kraft Foods Inc. exercises significant influence (20%—50% ownership interest), are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Investments in which Kraft Foods Inc. has an ownership interest of less than 20%, or does not exercise significant influence, are accounted for with the cost method of accounting.
All intercompany transactions and balances between and among Kraft's subsidiaries have been eliminated. 

26




 


Transactions
between any of the Company's businesses and Altria Group, Inc. and its affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements. 


Business Environment  

        The Company is subject to a number of challenges that may adversely affect its businesses. These challenges, which are discussed below and under the "Risk
Factors" section in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, include: 



•fluctuations
in commodity prices;
•movements
of foreign currencies;
•competitive
challenges in various products and markets, including price gaps with competitor products and the increasing price-consciousness of consumers;
•a
rising cost environment and the limited ability to increase prices;
•a
trend toward increasing consolidation in the retail trade and consequent pricing pressure and inventory reductions;
•a
growing presence of discount retailers, primarily in Europe, with an emphasis on own-label products;
•changing
consumer preferences, including diet trends;
•competitors
with different profit objectives and less susceptibility to currency exchange rates; and
•concerns
and/or regulations regarding food safety, quality and health, including genetically modified organisms, trans-fatty acids and obesity. Increased government
regulation of the food industry could result in increased costs to the Company. 


        In
the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers, including the timing of holidays and other annual or
special events, seasonality of certain products, significant weather conditions, timing of Company or customer incentive programs and pricing actions, customer inventory programs, Company initiatives
to improve supply chain efficiency, including efforts to align product shipments more closely with consumption by shifting some of its customer marketing programs to a consumption based approach,
financial condition of customers and general economic conditions. 

        Fluctuations
in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intense price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. During 2005, the Company's
commodity costs on average have been higher than those incurred in 2004 (most notably coffee, nuts, energy and packaging), and have adversely affected earnings. For 2005, the Company had a negative
pre-tax impact from all commodities of approximately $800 million as compared with 2004, following an increase of approximately $900 million for 2004 compared with 2003. 

Restructuring:  

        In January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program, with the objectives of leveraging the Company's global scale,
realigning and lowering its cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program (which is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), the
Company anticipated the closure or sale of up to 20 plants and the elimination of approximately 6,000 positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion
in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other implementation costs, including $297 million and $641 million incurred in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Total pre-tax charges for the program incurred through December 31, 2005 were $938 million and 

27




 


specific
programs announced will result in the elimination of approximately 5,500 positions. Approximately 60% of the pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. 

        In
addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $170 million in capital expenditures from 2004 through 2006 to implement the restructuring program. From
January 2004 through December 31, 2005, the Company spent $144 million, including $98 million spent in 2005, in capital to implement the restructuring program. Cost savings
as a result of the restructuring program were approximately $131 million in 2005 and $127 million in 2004, and were anticipated to reach cumulative annualized cost savings of
approximately $450 million by 2006, all of which were expected to be used to support brand-building initiatives. 

        In
January 2006, the Company announced plans to expand its restructuring efforts beyond those originally contemplated. Additional pre-tax charges are anticipated to be
$2.5 billion from 2006 to 2009, of which approximately $1.6 billion are expected to require cash payments. These charges will result in the anticipated closure of up to 20 additional
facilities and the elimination of approximately 8,000 additional positions. Initiatives under the expanded program include additional organizational streamlining and facility closures. The expanded
initiatives are expected to add approximately $700 million in annualized cost savings by 2009. Capital expenditures required for the expanded restructuring program will be included within the
Company's overall capital spending budget, which is expected to remain flat in 2006 versus 2005 at $1.2 billion. The entire restructuring program is expected to ultimately result in
$3.7 billion in pre-tax charges, the closure of up to 40 facilities, the elimination of approximately 14,000 positions and cumulative annualized cost savings at the completion of
the program of approximately $1.15 billion. Approximately $2.3 billion of the $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions:  

        One element of the Company's growth strategy is to strengthen its brand portfolios through a disciplined program of selective acquisitions and divestitures. The
Company is constantly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sells businesses to accelerate the shift in its portfolio toward businesses—whether global, regional
or local—that offer the Company a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of any future acquisition or divestiture could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and future sales of businesses could in some cases result in losses on sale. 

        As
previously discussed, the Company sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business in June 2005 for pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion.
The sale included the Life Savers, Creme Savers,  Altoids, Trolli<FONT
SIZE=2> and Sugus brands. The Company has
reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business prior to the closing date as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. The assets related to
the sugar confectionery business were reflected as assets of discontinued operations held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. The Company recorded a loss on sale of
discontinued operations of $297 million in the second quarter of 2005, related largely to taxes on the transaction. 

        During
2004, the Company acquired a U.S.-based beverage business for a total cost of $137 million. During 2003, the Company acquired a biscuits business in Egypt and trademarks
associated with a small U.S.-based natural foods business. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $98 million. 


        During
2005, the Company sold its fruit snacks assets, and incurred a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $93 million in recognition of this sale. Additionally, during
2005, the Company sold its U.K. desserts assets, its U.S. yogurt assets, a small business in Colombia, a minor trademark in Mexico and a small equity investment in Turkey. The aggregate proceeds
received from these sales were $238 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $108 million. In December 2005, the Company 

28




 


announced
the sales of certain Canadian assets and a small U.S. biscuit brand, and incurred pre-tax asset impairment charges of $176 million in recognition of these sales. These
transactions closed in the first quarter of 2006. 

        During
2004, the Company sold a Brazilian snack nuts business and trademarks associated with a candy business in Norway. The aggregate proceeds received from the sales of these
businesses were $18 million, on which pre-tax losses of $3 million were recorded. 

        During
2003, the Company sold a European rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Italy. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses were $96 million, on
which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $31 million. 

        The
operating results of the businesses acquired and sold, excluding the sugar confectionery business, in the aggregate, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.

        As
discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general
corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the
business performance and trends of the various business segments. 

2005 compared with 2004  

        The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for 2005 with 2004. 


        The
Company's 2005 results included 53 weeks of operating results compared with 52 weeks in 2004. The Company estimates that this extra week positively impacted net revenues and
operating income by approximately 2% in 2005 (approximately $625 million and $100 million, respectively). 

        Volume
increased 210 million pounds (1.1%), including the benefit of 53 weeks in 2005 results. Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, and the 53rd week of
shipments, volume decreased approximately 1% due primarily to a focus on mix improvement, a SKU reduction program, the impact of higher retail prices on category growth trends in the United States and
declines in certain international countries (most notably Germany), partially offset by new product introductions and growth in developing markets. 


        Net
revenues increased $1,945 million (6.0%) due primarily to favorable volume/mix ($1,086 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), favorable
currency ($533 million), higher net pricing ($453 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending) and the impact of acquisitions
($42 million), partially offset by the impact of divested businesses ($174 million). 

        Operating
income increased $140 million (3.0%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix ($479 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), lower asset
impairment and exit costs ($124 million), net gains on the sales of businesses ($111 million), favorable currency ($90 million) and a 2004 equity investment impairment charge
related to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($420 million, including higher benefit and marketing costs,
as well as costs associated with the 53rd week), higher fixed manufacturing costs 

32




 


($110 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($102 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), the net impact of higher
implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($37 million), and the impact of divestitures ($33 million). 


        Currency
movements increased net revenues by $533 million and operating income by $90 million. These increases were due primarily to the weakness of the U.S. dollar against
the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real and certain other currencies. 

        The
Company's reported effective income tax rate decreased by 2.9 percentage points to 29.4%, due primarily to the settlement of an outstanding U.S. tax claim of
$24 million; $82 million from the resolution of outstanding items in the Company's international operations; and $33 million in tax impacts associated with the sale of a U.S.
biscuit brand. The 2005 rate also includes a $53 million aggregate benefit from the domestic manufacturers' deduction provision and the dividend repatriation provision of the American Jobs
Creation Act. The tax provision in 2004 included the
$81 million favorable resolution of an outstanding tax item and the reversal of $35 million of tax accruals that were no longer required due to tax events that occurred during 2004. 

        Earnings
from continuing operations of $2,904 million increased $235 million (8.8%), due primarily to higher operating income and a lower income tax rate. Diluted EPS from
continuing operations, which was $1.72, increased by 11.0%. 

        Loss
from discontinued operations, net of income tax, increased $268 million, due primarily to a loss on sale of $297 million in 2005. The loss from discontinued operations
was due primarily to the recording of additional tax expense that arose from the sale of the sugar confectionery business in the second quarter of 2005. 

        Net
earnings of $2,632 million decreased $33 million (1.2%). Diluted EPS from net earnings, which was $1.55, was equal to 2004. 


2004 compared with 2003  

        The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for 2004 with 2003. 

        Volume
increased 509 million pounds (2.8%), due primarily to acquisitions and increased shipments in the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice segment, partially
offset by the impact of divested businesses. 

        Net
revenues increased $1,670 million (5.5%), due primarily to favorable currency ($838 million), higher volume/mix ($560 million), higher net pricing
($265 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending) and the impact of acquisitions ($140 million), partially offset by the impact of
divested businesses ($126 million). 

        Operating
income decreased $1,248 million (21.3%), due primarily to the pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($597 million), unfavorable costs,
net of higher pricing ($442 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($306 million), the
2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($50 million), the 2004 equity investment impairment charge relating to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), the
unfavorable net impact related to gains and losses on the sales of businesses ($34 million), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($23 million, including higher benefit costs) and the impact
of divestitures ($18 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($187 million) and favorable currency ($98 million). 

        Currency
movements increased net revenues by $838 million and operating income by $98 million. These increases were due primarily to the weakness of the U.S. dollar against
the euro and the Canadian dollar. 

33




 


        The
Company's reported effective income tax rate decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 32.3%, resulting from an $81 million favorable resolution of an outstanding tax item
and the reversal of $35 million of tax accruals that are no longer required due to tax events that occurred during 2004. 

        Earnings
from continuing operations of $2,669 million decreased $710 million (21.0%), due primarily to lower operating income, partially offset by a lower effective income
tax rate. Diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $1.55, decreased by 20.5%. 


        Earnings
from discontinued operations, net of income tax, decreased $101 million, resulting in a net loss of $4 million in 2004. The decrease was due primarily to
pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges in 2004 of $107 million ($69 million after-tax) and an intangible pre-tax asset impairment
charge of $17 million ($11 million after-tax). 

        Net
earnings of $2,665 million decreased $811 million (23.3%). Diluted EPS from net earnings, which was $1.55, decreased by 22.9%.

2005 compared with 2004  

        The following discussion compares Kraft North America Commercial's operating results for 2005 with 2004. 

        Volume
increased 2.0% including the benefit of 53 weeks in 2005 results. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, and the 53rd week of shipments, volume was essentially
flat. 

34




 


        Net
revenues increased $1,233 million (5.6%) due primarily to higher volume/mix ($873 million including the benefit of the 53rd week), higher net pricing
($239 million, reflecting commodity-driven price increases primarily on coffee, cheese, nuts and meats, partially offset by increased promotional spending), favorable currency
($172 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($41 million), partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($97 million). 

        Operating
companies income decreased $39 million (1.0%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($367 million, including higher benefit and
marketing costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($94 million), the net impact of higher implementation costs associated with the
restructuring program ($15 million), the impact of divestitures ($9 million) and unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($3 million, including higher commodity costs and
increased promotional spending), partially offset by favorable volume/mix ($364 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), lower pre-tax charges for asset
impairment and exit costs ($56 million) and favorable currency ($31 million). 

        The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft North America Commercial's reportable segments. 

        U.S. Beverages.    Volume increased 4.8% including the 53rd week of shipments
(approximately 2 percentage points of growth), due primarily to refreshment beverages, partially offset by a decline in coffee. Refreshment beverages volume increased, due primarily to the 2004
acquisition of Veryfine, partially offset by a shift to lower weight sugar-free powdered beverages. In coffee, volume declined due to the impact of commodity-driven price increases on
category consumption, although volume grew in premium brand coffee. 

        Net
revenues increased $297 million (11.6%), due primarily to higher pricing and lower promotional spending ($150 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in coffee),
higher volume/mix ($111 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week) and the impact of the 2004 Veryfine acquisition ($34 million). Refreshment beverages net revenues
increased, due primarily to expanded distribution of Veryfine and new product introductions in sugar-free powdered beverages. Coffee net
revenues increased, due primarily to increased prices and positive mix driven by volume growth in premium brands. 


        Operating
companies income decreased $21 million (4.4%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($101 million, including higher marketing and
benefit costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week) and higher fixed manufacturing costs ($12 million), partially offset by favorable volume/mix ($76 million
including the benefit of the 53rdweek) and higher pricing ($14 million, including higher commodity costs). 

        U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice.    Volume decreased 0.8% including the
53rd week of shipments (approximately 2 percentage points of growth), due primarily to the impact of the divestiture of the U.S. yogurt assets and lower shipments in Canada,
partially offset by gains in foodservice. In cheese, volume declined due primarily to the impact of the yogurt divestiture, partially offset by gains in natural cheese, cream cheese, process loaves
and cottage cheese. Volume declined in Canada, due primarily to lower shipments of grocery products, ready-to-drink beverages, coffee and desserts. Volume in the foodservice
business increased due primarily to the 2004 acquisition of the Veryfine beverage business. 

        Net
revenues increased $354 million (4.8%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix ($219 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), favorable currency
($172 million), higher pricing, net of higher promotional spending ($25 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in late 2004), and the impact of acquisitions ($7 million),
partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($67 million). Canada net revenues increased, due primarily to favorable currency and the impact of cheese and coffee pricing, partially offset by
increased promotional spending and lower volume. Cheese net revenues also increased, reflecting commodity-driven pricing from 2004, partially offset by increased promotional spending and 

35




 


the
divestiture of the yogurt assets. In foodservice, net revenues increased, due primarily to favorable currency and the impact of the 2004 Veryfine acquisition. 

        Operating
companies income increased $29 million (2.9%), due primarily to higher pricing and favorable costs ($78 million, net of higher promotional spending), favorable
volume/mix ($68 million including the benefit of the 53rd week) and favorable currency ($31 million), partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research
costs ($72 million, including higher benefit costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week), the impact of higher asset impairment and exit costs ($35 million),
higher fixed manufacturing costs ($28 million) and higher implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($12 million). 

        U.S. Convenient Meals.    Volume increased 2.8% including the 53rd week of shipments
(approximately 2 percentage points of growth), due primarily to higher shipments in meats, pizza and meals. Meats volume increased, aided by higher shipments of cold cuts and new product
introductions. Meals volume increased, due primarily to the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by the discontinuation of a product line. In pizza, volume also increased due
primarily to the 53rd week and new product introductions, partially offset by competitive activity. 


        Net
revenues increased $247 million (5.8%), due to higher volume/mix ($227 million, including the benefit of the 53rdweek) and higher pricing, net of
increased promotional spending ($20 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in meats and pizza). Meats net revenues increased, due primarily to higher volume and commodity-driven price
increases, partially offset by higher promotional spending. Pizza net revenues increased, driven by positive mix from new products and the impact of commodity-driven price increases. In meals, net
revenues increased due primarily to improved mix from new products, partially offset by the discontinuation of a product line and increased promotional spending. 


        Operating
companies income decreased $30 million (3.9%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($77 million, including higher marketing and
benefit costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week) and higher fixed manufacturing expenses ($30 million), partially offset by favorable volume/mix ($45 million
including the benefit of the 53rd week), lower pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($29 million) and higher pricing net of higher costs
($8 million, due primarily to higher commodity driven pricing). 

        U.S. Grocery.    Volume increased 1.1% due to the 53rd week of shipments (approximately
2 percentage points of growth). Enhancers volume increased slightly due primarily to higher shipments of spoonable dressings, partially offset by lower volume in pourable dressings and barbecue
sauce due to increased competitive activity. In desserts, volume increased aided by new product introductions in refrigerated ready-to-eat desserts, partially offset by
declines in dry packaged desserts and the impact of the fruit snacks divestiture. 

        Net
revenues decreased $4 million (0.2%), due primarily to the impact of divestitures ($30 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($20 million, including
the benefit of the 53rd week) and higher pricing, net of increased promotional spending ($5 million). Desserts net revenues decreased, due primarily to the impact of the fruit
snacks divestiture and declines in dry packaged desserts, partially offset by new product introductions in refrigerated ready-to-eat desserts and gains in marshmallows. 

        Operating
companies income decreased $151 million (16.9%), due primarily to higher pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($91 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($31 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($21 million, including higher benefit costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week) and higher fixed manufacturing costs ($10 million). 


        U.S. Snacks & Cereals.    Volume increased 3.5% including the 53rd week of
shipments (approximately 2 percentage points of growth), as gains in biscuits and cereals were partially offset by a decline in salted snacks. In biscuits, volume increased due primarily to new
product introductions in 

36




 


cookies.
Cereals volume increased due primarily to new product introductions and expanded distribution in ready-to-eat cereals. In salted snacks, volume declined due to higher
commodity-driven pricing on snack nuts and increased competitive activity. 


        Net
revenues increased $339 million (6.3%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($296 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week) and higher pricing, net
of increased promotional spending ($39 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in snack nuts and cereals). Biscuits net revenues increased, driven by new product introductions and improved
mix. Cereals net revenues also increased, due primarily to new product introductions and higher shipments and pricing of ready-to-eat cereals. Salted snacks net revenues
increased, as lower volume was offset by higher prices. 

        Operating
companies income increased $134 million (18.2%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($171 million including the benefit of the 53rd week) and lower
pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($153 million), partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($96 million, including higher
marketing and benefit costs, as well as costs associated with the 53rd week), unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($72 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and
increased promotional spending), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($15 million) and the net impact of higher implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($6 million). 

2004 compared with 2003  

        The following discussion compares Kraft North America Commercial's operating results for 2004 with 2003. 


        Volume
increased 4.3%, due primarily to an acquisition in the U.S. Beverages segment and increased shipments in the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice segment. 

        Net
revenues increased $1,123 million (5.4%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($537 million), higher net pricing ($312 million, reflecting commodity-driven price
increases, partially offset by increased promotional spending), favorable currency ($164 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($117 million). Higher net revenues were driven by
cheese, meats and nuts due to higher volume in
response to consumer nutrition trends and higher commodity-driven pricing net of increased promotional spending. 


        Operating
companies income decreased $788 million (16.9%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($391 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($356 million, including higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($214 million, including higher benefit costs) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($40 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix
($197 million) and favorable currency ($29 million). 

        The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft North America Commercial's reportable segments. 


        U.S. Beverages.    Volume increased 12.7%, due primarily to the 2004 acquisition of a beverage business
and new product introductions in refreshment beverages. In coffee, volume also increased, due to product quality improvements and the impact of an expanded distribution arrangement. 

        Net
revenues increased $122 million (5.0%), due primarily to the impact of acquisitions ($94 million) and higher volume/mix ($85 million), partially offset by
increased promotional spending ($56 million). Net revenues increased in refreshment beverages due primarily to the acquisition of Veryfine and increased shipments of sugar-free
powdered beverages. In coffee, increased net revenues were due primarily to favorable mix from higher shipments of premium coffee, partially offset by increased promotional spending in base coffee in
response to competitive activity. 

        Operating
companies income decreased $151 million (24.0%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($98 million), unfavorable costs and higher
promotional spending 

37




 


($85 million,
including higher commodity costs), the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($9 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with
the restructuring program ($4 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($49 million). 

        U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice.    Volume increased 3.5%, due primarily to
higher volume in foodservice and cheese. Volume in the foodservice business increased, due primarily to an acquisition of a beverage business in 2004 and higher shipments to national accounts. Cheese
volume also increased, benefiting from increased promotional spending. 

        Net
revenues increased $704 million (10.5%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($272 million), higher pricing, net of higher promotional reinvestment spending in cheese
($248 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing), favorable currency ($164 million) and the impact of acquisitions.    Cheese revenues increased due primarily to increased
shipments and commodity-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending. In Canada, net revenues also increased due to cheese pricing. Foodservice net revenues increased, due
primarily to commodity-driven net pricing in cheese and meat, and higher shipments. 


        Operating
companies income decreased $282 million (22.2%), due primarily to unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($214 million, including higher commodity costs and
increased promotional spending), the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($111 million), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($50 million, including higher
benefit costs), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($26 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($8 million), partially
offset by higher volume/mix ($99 million) and favorable currency ($29 million). 

        U.S. Convenient Meals.    Volume increased 1.6%, due primarily to gains in meats and pizza, partially
offset by lower shipments in meals. Meats volume increased driven by higher consumption of cold cuts, supported by higher investment spending. Pizza volume also increased, aided by new product
introductions. In meals, volume declined due to the discontinuation of certain product lines in the second half of 2003. 

        Net
revenues increased $192 million (4.7%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($114 million), higher pricing ($75 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in
meats and pizza) and the impact of acquisitions. Meats net revenues increased due primarily to higher shipments of cold cuts, bacon and hot dogs, and commodity-driven pricing. In pizza, net revenues
were higher due to new product introductions and commodity-driven pricing actions. Meals net revenues increased slightly as the impact of higher shipments of dinners was partially offset by the
discontinuation of a product line. 

        Operating
companies income decreased $46 million (5.6%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($41 million), higher
marketing, administration and research costs ($38 million, including higher benefit costs), the impact of acquisitions ($5 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the
restructuring program ($4 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($40 million) and higher pricing, net of unfavorable costs ($7 million, including higher commodity
costs). 

        U.S. Grocery.    Volume increased 0.7%, due primarily to gains in enhancers, partially offset by a
decline in desserts. Volume increased in enhancers, due primarily to mayonnaise and salad dressings. In desserts, volume declined, due primarily to lower shipments of fruit snacks, partially offset by
higher shipments in frozen toppings. 

        Net
revenues increased $37 million (1.5%), due primarily to higher pricing and lower promotional spending ($34 million) and higher volume/mix. In enhancers, net revenues
increased due primarily to higher shipments of pourable and spoonable salad dressings. Desserts net revenues increased due primarily to lower promotional spending for new product introductions and
favorable mix from sugar-free desserts. 

38




 

        Operating
companies income was equal to the prior year, as lower fixed manufacturing costs ($17 million) and higher volume/mix ($10 million) were offset by the 2004
pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($8 million), the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($6 million), higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($5 million) and unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing. 

        U.S. Snacks & Cereals.    Volume increased 1.5%, as higher salted snacks and biscuits volume was
partially offset by a decline in cereals. Salted snacks volume increased due to consumer nutrition trends and marketing programs in nuts. In biscuits, volume increased, driven by new product
introductions. In cereals, volume declined due to low carbohydrate diet trends, which impacted the category, and increased competitive activity. 


        Net
revenues increased $68 million (1.3%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($62 million) and higher pricing ($11 million, including the absence of high product
returns associated with new products incurred in 2003, partially offset by increased promotional spending). In snacks, higher net revenues were due primarily to increased shipments of snack nuts due
to consumer nutrition trends. Biscuit net revenues were higher due to the impact of lower product returns, partially offset by higher promotional spending. Cereals net revenues decreased due to lower
shipments caused by consumer nutrition trends and increased competitive activity. 

        Operating
companies income decreased $309 million (29.5%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($222 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($62 million, due to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($47 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($18 million), partially offset by lower fixed manufacturing costs ($40 million).

2005 compared with 2004  

        The following discussion compares Kraft International Commercial's operating results for 2005 with 2004. 

        Volume
decreased 1.2% including the benefit of 53 weeks in 2005 results. Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2005 and the impact of divestitures, volume decreased
approximately 2%, due primarily to the effect of commodity-driven pricing. 

39




 


        Net
revenues increased $712 million (7.0%), due primarily to favorable currency ($361 million), higher pricing, net of increased promotional spending ($214 million,
including commodity-driven pricing) and favorable volume/mix ($213 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), partially offset by the impact of divestitures
($77 million). Net revenues were up 14% in developing markets, driven by significant growth in Russia, Ukraine and the Middle East. In addition, net revenues increased in several Western
European markets, partially offset by a decline in volume, particularly in Germany. 

        Operating
companies income increased $189 million (20.3%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix ($115 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), net
gains on the sale of businesses ($112 million), lower pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($68 million), favorable currency ($59 million) and a 2004
equity investment impairment charge related to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), partially offset by unfavorable costs and increased promotional spending, net of higher pricing
($99 million, including higher commodity costs), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($53 million, including higher marketing and benefit costs, and costs associated with
the 53rd week, partially offset by a $16 million recovery of receivables previously written off), the impact of divestitures ($24 million), the net impact of higher
implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($22 million) and higher fixed manufacturing costs ($16 million). 

        The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft International Commercial's reportable segments. 

        Europe, Middle East & Africa.    Volume decreased 1.8% including the 53rd week of
shipments (approximately 2 percentage points of growth), due primarily to lower volume in Germany and the divestiture of the U.K. desserts assets in the first quarter of 2005, partially offset
by growth in developing markets, including Russia, Ukraine and the Middle East. In grocery, volume declined, due to the divestiture of the U.K. desserts assets in the first quarter of 2005 and lower
results in Egypt and Germany. Beverages volume declined, driven by lower coffee shipments in Germany, due to commodity-driven price increases, partially offset by higher refreshment beverage shipments
in the Middle East and higher coffee shipments in Russia and Ukraine. Convenient meals volume declined, due primarily to lower category performance in the U.K. and lower promotions in Germany. Cheese
volume increased due to higher shipments in the U.K., Italy and the Middle East. In snacks, volume increased, as gains in confectionery, benefiting from growth in Russia and Ukraine, were partially
offset by lower biscuits volume in Egypt. 

        Net
revenues increased $477 million (6.3%), due primarily to favorable currency ($235 million), favorable volume/mix ($171 million, including the benefit of the
53rd week), higher pricing, net of increased promotional spending ($131 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in coffee), partially offset by the impact of divestitures
($60 million). Significant growth in Russia and Ukraine was partially offset by a decline in Germany. 


        Operating
companies income increased $115 million (16.8%), due primarily to net gains on the sale of businesses ($108 million), favorable volume/mix ($87 million
including the benefit of the 53rd week), lower pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($53 million), a 2004 equity investment impairment charge related to
a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million) and favorable currency ($32 million), partially offset by unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($144 million, due primarily to higher
commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($30 million, including costs associated with the 53rd week), the impact
of divestitures ($25 million) and the net impact of higher implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($17 million). 


        Latin America & Asia Pacific.    Volume decreased 0.4% including the 53rd week of
shipments (approximately 2 percentage points of growth), due primarily to lower shipments in China, partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia. Grocery volume declined, due primarily to lower
shipments in Brazil and Central America. Snacks volume also declined, impacted by increased biscuit competition in China and resizing of biscuit products in Latin America, partially offset by higher
shipments in Venezuela. In 

40




 


beverages,
volume increased, due primarily to refreshment beverage gains in the Philippines, Argentina and Puerto Rico. 

        Net
revenues increased $235 million (9.1%), due primarily to favorable currency ($126 million), higher pricing, net of increased promotional spending ($83 million)
and favorable volume/mix ($42 million, including the benefit of the 53rdweek), partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($17 million). Net revenues increased in
several geographies, including volume and pricing gains in Venezuela, and increased refreshment beverage and cheese shipments in the Philippines. Net revenues declined in China, where the Company
faced increased competitive activity in biscuits. 

        Operating
companies income increased $74 million (29.6%), due primarily to higher pricing net of unfavorable costs ($45 million, including increased promotional spending),
favorable volume/mix ($28 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week), favorable currency ($27 million) and lower pre-tax charges for asset impairment and
exit costs ($15 million), partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($23 million, including costs associated with the 53rd week, partially
offset by a $16 million recovery of receivables previously written off) and higher fixed manufacturing costs ($18 million). 

2004 compared with 2003  

        The following discussion compares Kraft International Commercial's operating results for 2004 with 2003. 

        Volume
decreased 1.1%, due primarily to the impact of the divestiture of a rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, as well as price competition and trade
inventory reductions in several markets, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. 

        Net
revenues increased $547 million (5.7%), due primarily to favorable currency ($674 million), the impact of acquisitions ($23 million) and favorable volume/mix
($23 million), partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($126 million) and increased promotional spending, net of higher pricing
($47 million). Lower pricing and higher promotional spending on coffee in Europe and lower shipments of refreshment beverages in Mexico negatively impacted net revenues. 


        Operating
companies income decreased $460 million (33.0%), due primarily to the pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($206 million), unfavorable
costs and increased promotional spending, net of higher pricing ($113 million), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($92 million, including higher benefit costs and
infrastructure investment in developing markets), the 2004 equity investment impairment charge related to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), the unfavorable net impact related to gains
and losses on the sales of businesses ($34 million), the impact of divestitures ($18 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program
($10 million), partially offset by favorable currency ($69 million).

        The following discusses operating results within each of Kraft International Commercial's reportable segments. 

        Europe, Middle East & Africa.    Volume decreased 1.3%, due primarily to the divestiture of a
rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, price competition in France and trade inventory reductions in Russia, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and volume
growth in Germany, Austria, Italy and Romania. Cheese volume declined, impacted by the divestiture of a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, partially offset by increased cream cheese
shipments in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, and higher process cheese shipments in the United Kingdom. Beverages volume also declined, driven by price competition in coffee in France and lower
shipments of refreshment beverages in the Middle East. Convenient meals volume declined, impacted by the divestiture of a rice business in Europe in 2003. In grocery, volume declined across several
markets, including Germany and Italy, partially offset by increased volume in Egypt, due to an acquisition. Snacks volume increased, as gains in biscuits, benefiting from acquisitions, and new
confectionery product introductions across the segment, were partially offset by trade inventory reductions in Russia. 

        Net
revenues increased $508 million (7.2%), due primarily to favorable currency ($649 million), favorable volume/mix ($48 million) and the impact of acquisitions
($21 million), partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($115 million) and lower pricing and increased promotional spending ($95 million). In cheese, net revenues decreased
primarily due to the divestiture of certain fresh cheese brands in Italy, partially offset by increased shipments of cream cheese and process cheese in Europe. Snacks net revenues increased due to a
salted snacks acquisition in Turkey, a biscuits acquisition in Egypt and higher confectionery shipments in Germany. In beverages, net revenues declined due to coffee price reductions in France and
higher promotional spending in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, partially offset by higher shipments in Ukraine and Romania. Convenient meals net revenues declined due to lower shipments in

Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, partially offset by growth in Brazil and China. Snacks volume declined, impacted by price competition and trade inventory reductions in Venezuela and Peru. In grocery,
volume declined across several markets, including Peru, Australia and the Philippines. Cheese volume increased, due primarily to gains across several markets, including Japan, Australia and the
Philippines. Beverages volume also increased, due primarily to gains in Brazil and China, partially offset by increased competitive activity in Mexico. 

        Net
revenues increased $39 million (1.5%), due primarily to higher pricing ($48 million, reflecting devaluation-driven cost increases, net of increased promotional
spending) and favorable currency ($25 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix ($25 million) and the impact of divestitures ($11 million). Cheese net revenues increased due
to higher shipments and price increases across Latin America, Southeast Asia and Australia. In snacks, net revenues decreased due to the divestiture of a snack nuts business in Brazil. Beverage net
revenues declined due primarily to lower shipments in Mexico as a result of increased price competition from carbonated beverages. In grocery, net revenues increased due primarily to higher shipments
in Venezuela. Convenient meals net revenues increased due to higher shipments to Puerto Rico.

        Operating
companies income decreased $141 million (36.1%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($43 million), the 2004 pre-tax
charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($32 million), lower volume/mix ($25 million), unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($21 million, including increased promotional
spending), unfavorable currency ($9 million) and the 2004 pre-tax loss on the sale of a snack nuts business in Brazil ($8 million). 

Financial Review  

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  

        Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2005, $4.0 billion in 2004 and $4.1 billion in 2003. The decrease in 2005
operating cash flows from 2004 was due primarily to an increase in income tax payments (primarily related to the sale of the sugar confectionery business), an increase in the use of cash to fund
working capital, due primarily to an increase in cash payments associated with the restructuring plan, and lower earnings, partially offset by lower pension plan
contributions. The decrease in 2004 operating cash flows from 2003 was due primarily to lower net earnings, cash payments associated with the restructuring program and higher pension contributions,
partially offset by a lower use of cash to fund working capital. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities  

        One element of the growth strategy of the Company is to strengthen its brand portfolios through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures.
The Company is constantly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sells businesses to accelerate the shift in its portfolio toward businesses—whether global,
regional or local—that offer the Company a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of future acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on the Company's cash flows. 

        During
2005, net cash provided by investing activities was $525 million, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in 2004
and 2003, respectively. The cash provided by investing activities in 2005 includes the proceeds from sales of businesses, including the sugar confectionery business, fruit snacks assets, U.K. desserts
assets, U.S. yogurt assets, a small business in Colombia, a small equity investment in Turkey and a minor trademark in Mexico. The increase in 2004 primarily reflected higher uses of cash for the
purchase of businesses and the reduction of cash received from the sales of businesses, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. 

        Capital
expenditures, which were funded by operating activities, were $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005
capital expenditures were primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities, implement the restructuring program, and support new product and productivity initiatives. In 2006, capital expenditures are
currently expected to be flat to 2005 expenditures, including capital expenditures required for the restructuring program. These expenditures are expected to be funded from operations. 


Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  

        During 2005, net cash of $4.0 billion was used in financing activities, compared with $3.2 billion during 2004. The increase in cash used in 2005
was due primarily to an increase in the Company's Class A share repurchases and the repayment of debt, partially offset by an increase in amounts due to Altria Group, Inc. and
affiliates. 

        During
2004, net cash of $3.2 billion was used in financing activities, compared with $2.8 billion during 2003. The increase in cash used in 2004 was due primarily to an
increase in the Company's Class A share repurchases and dividend payments. In November 2004, the Company issued 

43




 


$750 million
in third-party long-term debt, the net proceeds of which were used to refinance maturing debt. 

Debt and Liquidity  

        Debt.    The Company's total debt, including amounts due to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates, was $11.2 billion
at December 31, 2005 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.38 at December 31, 2005 and 0.42 at
December 31, 2004. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.27 at December 31, 2005 and 0.30 at December 31, 2004. 

        In
November 2004, the Company issued $750 million of 5-year notes bearing interest at 4.125%. The net proceeds of the offering were used to refinance maturing
debt. The Company has a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under which the Company may sell debt securities and/or
warrants to purchase debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total amount of $4.0 billion. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $3.5 billion of capacity remaining under
its shelf registration. 

        At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates of $652 million and $227 million,
respectively. The amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. generally include accrued dividends, taxes and service fees. Interest on intercompany borrowings is based on the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate. The Company had no long-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates. 

        Credit Ratings.    Following a $10.1 billion judgment on March 21, 2003, against Altria Group, Inc.'s
domestic tobacco subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., the three major credit rating agencies took a series of ratings actions resulting in the lowering of the Company's short-term
and long-term debt ratings, despite the fact the Company is neither a party to, nor has exposure to, this litigation. The Company's credit ratings by Moody's at December 31, 2005,
were "P-2" for short-term debt and "A3" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Standard & Poor's at December 31,
2005 were "A-2" for short-term debt and "BBB+" for long-term
debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Fitch Rating Services at December 31, 2005 were "F-2" for short-term debt and "BBB+" for long-term
debt, with stable outlook. As a result of the rating agencies' actions, borrowing costs have increased. None of the Company's debt agreements requires accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease
in credit ratings. The credit rating downgrades by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Rating Services had no impact on any of the Company's other existing third-party contracts. 

        Credit Lines.    The Company maintains revolving credit facilities that have historically been used to support the issuance of
commercial paper. In April 2005, the Company terminated its $2.0 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility expiring in July 2006 and its $2.5 billion,
364-day revolving credit facility expiring in July 2005 and replaced them with a new $4.5 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility that expires in
April 2010. At December 31, 2005, the credit line for the Company and the related activity were as follows (in billions of dollars):

        The
Company's revolving credit facility, which is for its sole use, requires the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $20.0 billion. At December 31, 2005, the Company's
net worth was $29.6 billion. The Company expects to continue to meet this covenant. The revolving credit facility does not include any other financial tests, any credit rating triggers or any
provisions that could require the posting of collateral. The Company expects to refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The 

44




 


nature
and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements,
market conditions and other factors. 

        In
addition to the above, certain international subsidiaries of Kraft maintain uncommitted credit lines to meet the short-term working capital needs of the international
businesses. These credit lines, which amounted to approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005, are for the sole use of the Company's international businesses. Borrowings on these
lines amounted to approximately $400 million and $150 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations  

        The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below. 

        Guarantees.    As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had third-party guarantees,
which are primarily derived from acquisition and divestiture activities, of approximately $27 million at December 31, 2005. Substantially all of these guarantees expire through 2013,
with $14 million expiring during 2006. The Company is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments or achieve performance
measures. The Company has a liability of $17 million on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005, relating to these guarantees. 

        In
addition, at December 31, 2005, the Company was contingently liable for $127 million of guarantees related to its own performance. These include surety bonds related to
dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of customs duties and taxes, and letters of credit. 

        Guarantees
do not have, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on the Company's liquidity. 

        Aggregate Contractual Obligations.    The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at

(1)Amounts
represent the expected cash payments of the Company's long-term debt and do not include bond premiums or discounts, and interest.
(2)Operating
leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company has no significant capital lease obligations.
(3)Purchase
obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and
distribution) are 
45




 


commitments
for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology
and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure
and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty, and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. 



(4)Other
long-term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific severance and incentive compensation arrangements. The following long-term liabilities
included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension, postretirement health care and postemployment costs, income taxes, minority interest, insurance accruals
and other accruals. The Company is unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. Currently, the Company anticipates making U.S. pension contributions of approximately
$140 million in 2006 and non-U.S. pension contributions of approximately $106 million in 2006, based on current tax law (as discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements). 



        The
Company believes that its cash from operations and existing credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs (including the cash requirements of
the restructuring program), planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations and payment of its anticipated quarterly dividends. 


Equity and Dividends  

        In December 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time to time of up to $700 million of the Company's Class A
common stock. In December 2004, the Company completed the program, acquiring 21.7 million Class A shares at an average price of $32.23 per share. In December 2004, the
Company commenced repurchasing shares under a two-year $1.5 billion Class A common stock repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors. Through December 31,
2005, repurchases under the $1.5 billion program were 40.6 million shares at a cost of $1.25 billion, or $30.81 per share. During 2005, the Company repurchased 39.2 million
shares at a cost of $1.2 billion, and in 2004, the Company repurchased 21.5 million shares at a cost of $700 million. 


        In
March 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $2.0 billion of the Company's Class A
common stock. This new program, expected to run through 2008, will commence upon the completion of the existing two-year $1.5 billion program, which is expected to be completed
during the first quarter of 2006. 

        As
discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2005 and 2004, the Company granted approximately 4.2 million and 4.1 million restricted
Class A shares, respectively, to eligible U.S.-based employees, and during 2005 and 2004, also issued to eligible
non-U.S. employees rights to receive approximately 1.8 million and 1.9 million Class A equivalent shares, respectively. The market value per restricted share or right
was $33.32 and $32.23 on the dates of the 2005 and 2004 grants, respectively. Restrictions on most of the stock and rights granted in 2005 lapse in the first quarter of 2008, while restrictions on
grants in 2004 lapse in the first quarter of 2007. 

        In
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"). SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure compensation cost for
share-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt this new standard prospectively, on January 1, 2006, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2005, the number of shares to be issued upon 

46




 


exercise
of outstanding stock options and vesting of non-U.S. rights to receive equivalent shares was 19.9 million, or 1.2% of total Class A and Class B shares
outstanding. 

        Dividends
paid in 2005 and 2004 were $1,437 million and $1,280 million, respectively, an increase of 12.3%, reflecting a higher dividend rate in 2005, partially offset by a
lower number of shares outstanding as a result of Class A share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 12.2% increase in the current
quarterly dividend rate to $0.23 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $0.92 per common share. The declaration of
dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the Company's net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future
prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. 

Market Risk  

        The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments to manage
its foreign currency and commodity exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. 

        During
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges was not material. At December 31, 2005, the Company was hedging
forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next fifteen months. The Company estimates that derivative losses of approximately $2 million, net of income taxes, reported in accumulated
other comprehensive
earnings (losses) at December 31, 2005 will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next twelve months. 


        Foreign Exchange Rates.    The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to mitigate its
exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are effective as hedges.
The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed, based on the size and location of its businesses, include the euro, Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Company had foreign exchange option and forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The effective portion of
unrealized gains and losses associated with forward and option contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are
reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings. 

        Commodities.    The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities used as raw
materials by its businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for coffee and cocoa. Commodity futures and options are also used to hedge the
price of certain commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar and soybean oil. In general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS
No. 133 and are, therefore, not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had net long commodity positions of $521 million and
$443 million, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net commodity positions were immaterial at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on
commodity futures and option contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated
statement of earnings when the related inventory is sold. 

47




 


        Value at Risk.    The Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the
fair value of its interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of its foreign currency and commodity
price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR computation includes the Company's debt; short-term investments; foreign currency forwards, swaps and options; and commodity
futures, forwards and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to
hedge, were excluded from the computation. 

        The
VAR estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. The Company used a "variance/co-variance" model to determine the observed
interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These
interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a
one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. 


        The
estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of the Company's interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the
estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the VAR model, were as

        This
VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates, foreign currency
rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the
effect of favorable changes in market rates. The Company cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and does not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in such
market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on its future results of operations or financial position.

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

        Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that: 



•pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America;
•provide
reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and
•provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements. 


        Internal
control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. 


        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the
operational effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. 

        Based
on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 

        PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this report, has
audited our management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kraft Foods Inc.: 

        We
have completed integrated audits of Kraft Foods Inc.'s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions on
Kraft Foods Inc.'s 2005, 2004, and 2003 consolidated financial statements and on its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on our audits, are presented
below. 

Consolidated financial statements  

        In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kraft Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of Kraft Foods Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 


Internal control over financial reporting  

        Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting dated February 7, 2006,
that Kraft Foods Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, Kraft Foods Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. Kraft Foods Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of Kraft Foods Inc.'s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions. 

        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal 

50




 


control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<A
NAME="page_du1135_1_56">   KRAFT FOODS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1.    Background and Basis of Presentation:  

Background:  

        Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and its subsidiaries are
hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of packaged foods and beverages in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Middle East and
Africa. 

        Prior
to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share. At December 31, 2005, Altria Group, Inc. held 98.3% of the combined voting power of the Company's
outstanding capital stock and owned 87.2% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock. 

        In
June 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. The Company has
reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business prior to the closing date as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings. The assets related to the sugar confectionery
business were reflected as assets of discontinued operations held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. 


        In
October 2005, the Company announced that, effective January 1, 2006, its Canadian business will be realigned to better integrate it into the Company's North American
business by product category. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the operating results of the Canadian business will be reported throughout the North American food segments. In addition, in the
first quarter of 2006, the Company's international businesses will be realigned to reflect the reorganization announced within Europe in November 2005. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006,
the operating results of the Company's international businesses will be reported in two revised segments—European Union; and to reflect increased management attention to the reporting in
the Company's developing markets—Developing Markets, Oceania and North Asia. Accordingly, prior period segment results will be restated. 

Basis of presentation:  

        The consolidated financial statements include Kraft, as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which the Company exercises
significant influence (20%—50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in which the Company has an ownership interest of less than 20%, or
does not exercise significant influence, are accounted for with the cost method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances between and among Kraft's subsidiaries have been eliminated.
Transactions between any of the Company's businesses and Altria Group, Inc. and its affiliates are included in these financial statements. 

        The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible
assets, marketing programs and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 


        The
Company's operating subsidiaries generally report year-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each year. This resulted in fifty-three weeks of operating
results in the Company's 

56




 


consolidated
statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005, versus fifty-two weeks for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. 

        As
discussed in Note 13. Income Taxes, classification of certain prior years' amounts have been revised to conform with the current
year's presentation. 

Note 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  

Cash and cash equivalents:  

        Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 


Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation:  

        Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years. 

        Definite
life intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and intangible assets for potential
impairment. Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered
impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows. Impairment testing
for non-amortizable intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible
asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual review of goodwill and intangible assets and no impairment charges
resulted from this review. However, as part of the sale or pending sale of certain Canadian assets and two brands, the Company recorded total non-cash pre-tax asset impairment
charges of $269 million in 2005, which included impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $13 million and $118 million, respectively, as well as $138 million of asset
write-downs. During 2004, the Company's annual review of goodwill and intangible assets resulted in a $29 million non-cash pre-tax charge related to an intangible asset
impairment for a small confectionery business in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A portion of this charge, $12 million, was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the
consolidated statement of earnings. The remainder of the charge, $17 million, was included in discontinued operations. 

        At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in millions):

        Non-amortizable
intangible assets consist substantially of brand names purchased through the Nabisco acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of certain
trademark licenses and non-compete agreements. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $10 million, $11 million and $9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is currently estimated to be approximately $7 million or less.

        Other
in 2004, above, includes the reclassification to goodwill of certain amounts previously classified as indefinite life intangible assets, as well as tax adjustments related to the
Nabisco acquisition. 

Environmental costs:  

        The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental
remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. 


        While
it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental remediation and compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the
future, in the opinion of management, environmental remediation and compliance costs, before taking into account any recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Foreign currency translation:  

        The Company translates the results of operations of its foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are
translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders' 

58




 


equity.
Transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings and were not significant for any of the periods presented. 

Guarantees:  

        The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Interpretation No. 45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees and the recognition of a
liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18. Contingencies for a further discussion of
guarantees. 

Hedging instruments:  

        Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge
transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are reclassified to the consolidated
statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in
the consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Impairment of long-lived assets:  

        The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of
recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment
is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less
costs of disposal. 

Income taxes:  

        The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The
U.S. accounts of the Company are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Altria Group, Inc. Income taxes are generally computed on a separate company basis. To the extent that
foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot currently be utilized on a separate company basis, are utilized in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated
federal income tax return, the benefit is recognized in the calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. Based on the Company's current estimate, this benefit is calculated to be
approximately $225 million, $70 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 is driven primarily by
dividend repatriations and certain legal entity reorganizations. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Altria Group, Inc. for the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in
Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return, including current taxes payable and net changes in tax provisions. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax
provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that their tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain
positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company evaluates and potentially adjusts these provisions in light of changing facts and
circumstances. The consolidated tax provision includes the impact of changes to accruals that are considered appropriate. Upon the closure of current 

59




 


and
future tax audits in various jurisdictions, significant income tax accrual reversals could continue to occur, which could trigger reimbursements from Altria Group, Inc. 

Inventories:  

        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost a majority of domestic
inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method. 

        In
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs." SFAS No. 151 requires that abnormal idle facility expense, spoilage, freight and handling costs be recognized as
current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventories be based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The
Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 151 prospectively as of January 1, 2006, but the effect of adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Marketing costs:  

        The Company promotes its products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons,
rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction
of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes,
advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year. 

Revenue recognition:  

        The Company recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment or delivery of goods when
title and risk of loss pass to customers. Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. 


Software costs:  

        The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for
internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the software, which do not exceed five years. 

Stock-based compensation:  

        The Company accounts for employee stock compensation plans in accordance with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," which has not resulted in compensation cost for stock options. The market value at date of grant of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock is recorded as
compensation expense over the period of restriction (three years). 

        At
December 31, 2005, the Company had stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 11. Stock
Plans. The Company applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related Interpretations in accounting for stock options within those plans. No compensation expense for employee stock options is reflected in net earnings, as all stock options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Net 

60




 


earnings,
as reported, includes pre-tax compensation expense related to restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock of $148 million, $106 million and
$57 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share ("EPS") if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to measure compensation expense for outstanding stock option awards (using a modified Black-Scholes methodology) for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in millions, except per share data):

        In
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"). SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure compensation cost for
share-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt this new standard prospectively, on January 1, 2006, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 3.    Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs:  


Restructuring Program:  

        In January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging the Company's global scale,
realigning and lowering its cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program, the Company anticipates the closing or sale of up to 20 plants and the elimination of
approximately 6,000 positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other
implementation costs, including $297 million and $641 million incurred in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Approximately 60% of the pre-tax charges are expected to require cash
payments. In addition, in January 2006, the Company announced plans to continue its restructuring efforts beyond those originally contemplated. Additional pre-tax charges are
anticipated to be $2.5 billion from 2006 to 2009, of which approximately $1.6 billion are expected to require cash payments. These charges will result in the anticipated closure of up to
20 additional facilities and the elimination of approximately 8,000 additional positions. Initiatives under the expanded program include additional organizational streamlining and facility closures.
The entire restructuring program is expected to ultimately result in $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges, the closure of up to 40 facilities and the elimination of approximately 14,000
positions. Approximately $2.3 billion of the $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. 

61




 


Restructuring Costs:  

        During 2005 and 2004, pre-tax charges under the restructuring program of $210 million and $583 million, respectively, were recorded as
asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statements of earnings. These pre-tax charges resulted from the announcement of the closing of 19 plants since January 2004, of
which 6 occurred in 2005, the termination of co-manufacturing agreements in 2004, and the continuation of a number of workforce reduction programs. Approximately $170 million of the
pre-tax charges incurred in 2005 will require cash payments.

        Severance
costs in the above schedule, which relate to the workforce reduction programs, include the cost of related benefits. Specific programs announced during 2004 and 2005, as part
of the overall restructuring program, will result in the elimination of approximately 5,500 positions. At December 31, 2005, approximately 4,900 of these positions have been eliminated. Asset
write-downs relate to the impairment of assets caused by the plant closings and related activity. Other costs incurred relate primarily to contract termination costs associated with the plant closings
and the termination of co-manufacturing and leasing agreements. Severance charges taken against assets relate to incremental pension costs, which reduce prepaid pension assets. 

Implementation Costs:  

        During 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax implementation costs associated with the restructuring program. These costs include the
discontinuance of certain product lines and incremental costs related to the integration and streamlining of functions and closure of facilities. Substantially all implementation costs incurred in
2005 will require cash payments. These costs were recorded on the consolidated statements of earnings as follows:

Asset Impairment Charges:  

        During 2005, the Company sold its fruit snacks assets for approximately $30 million and incurred a pre-tax asset impairment charge of
$93 million in recognition of the sale. During December 2005, the Company reached agreements to sell certain assets in Canada and a small biscuit brand in the U.S. These transactions are
expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. The Company incurred pre-tax asset impairment charges of $176 million in recognition of these pending sales. These charges, which
include the write-off of all associated intangible assets, were recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings. 

        During
2005, the Company completed its annual review of goodwill and intangible assets and no charges resulted from this review. During 2004, the Company recorded non-cash
pre-tax charges of $29 million related to an intangible asset impairment for a small confectionery business in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A portion of this
charge, $17 million, was reclassified to earnings from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004. The remaining charge was recorded as
asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings. 

        In
November 2004, following discussions with the Company's joint venture partner in Turkey and an independent valuation of its equity investment, it was determined that a
permanent decline in value had occurred. This valuation resulted in a $47 million non-cash pre-tax charge. This charge was recorded as marketing, administration and
research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings. During 2005, the Company's interest in the joint venture was sold. 


        In
June 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.4 billion. In 2004, as a result of the anticipated transaction,
the Company recorded
non-cash asset impairments totaling $107 million. This charge was included in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings. 

        In
December 2004, the Company announced the sale of its yogurt assets, which closed in the first quarter of 2005. In 2004, as a result of the anticipated transaction, the Company
recorded asset impairments totaling $8 million. This charge was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings.

Total:  

        The pre-tax asset impairment, exit and implementation costs discussed above, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were included in

Other:  

        During
2003, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $6 million for asset impairment and exit costs related to the closure of a Nordic snacks plant. This charge was
included in the operating companies income of the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. 


Note 4.    Related Party Transactions:  

        Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiary, Altria Corporate Services, Inc., provides the Company with various services, including planning, legal, treasury,
auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the secretary, corporate affairs, information technology, aviation and tax services. Billings for these services, 

64




 


which
were based on the cost to Altria Corporate Services, Inc. to provide such services and a management fee, were $237 million, $310 million and $318 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company performed at a similar cost various functions in 2005 that previously had been provided by Altria Corporate
Services, Inc., resulting in a lower service charge in 2005. These costs were paid to Altria Corporate Services, Inc. monthly. Although the cost of these services cannot be quantified on
a stand-alone basis, management has assessed that the billings are reasonable based on the level of support provided by Altria Corporate Services, Inc., and that they reflect all services
provided. The cost and nature of the services are reviewed annually by the Company's Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The effects of these transactions are included in
operating cash flows in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. 

        During
2005, the Company repatriated certain foreign earnings as part of Altria Group, Inc.'s dividend repatriation plan under provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
Increased taxes for this repatriation of $21 million, were reimbursed by Altria Group, Inc. The reimbursement was reported in the Company's financial statements as an increase to
additional paid-in capital. 

        In
December 2005, the Company purchased an airport hangar and certain personal property located at the hangar in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from Altria Corporate Services, Inc.
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.3 million. 

        In
December 2004, the Company purchased two corporate aircraft from Altria Corporate Services, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $47 million. The
Company also entered into an Aircraft Management Agreement with Altria Corporate Services, Inc. in December 2004, pursuant to which Altria Corporate Services, Inc. agreed to
perform aircraft management, pilot services, maintenance and other aviation services for the Company. 

        During
2004, Altria Corporate Services, Inc. provided to the Company certain financial services, including payroll and accounts payable processing, at a cost of approximately
$25 million, which was included in the $310 million charge shown above. In 2005, the Company performed these functions for itself at a similar cost. 

        At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. of $652 million and $227 million, respectively.
The amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. generally include accrued dividends, taxes and service fees. Interest on intercompany borrowings is based on the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate. 

        The
fair values of the Company's short-term amounts due to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates approximate carrying amounts.

        In June 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion.
The sale included the Life Savers, Creme Savers,  Altoids, Trolli<FONT
SIZE=2> and Sugus brands. The Company has
reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business prior to the closing date as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. Pursuant to the sugar
confectionery sale agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain transition and supply services to the buyer. These service arrangements are primarily for terms of one year or less, with the
exception of one supply arrangement with a term of not more than three years. The expected cash flow from this supply arrangement is not significant.

which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $31 million. 

        The
operating results of the other divestitures, discussed above, in the aggregate, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows in any of the periods presented.

Note 7.    Inventories:  

        The cost of approximately 40% and 37% of inventories in 2005 and 2004, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The stated LIFO amounts of inventories
were approximately $71 million and $81 million higher than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Note 8.    Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements:

        The
fair values of the Company's short-term borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed
above. 

        The
Company maintains revolving credit facilities that have historically been used to support the issuance of commercial paper. In April 2005, the Company terminated its
$2.0 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility expiring in July 2006 and its $2.5 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in
July 2005 and replaced them with a new $4.5 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility that expires in April 2010. At December 31, 2005, the credit line for
the Company and the related activity were as follows (in billions of dollars):

        The
Company's revolving credit facility, which is for its sole use, requires the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $20.0 billion. At December 31, 2005, the Company's
net worth was $29.6 billion. The Company expects to continue to meet this covenant. The revolving credit facility does not include any other financial tests, any credit rating triggers or any
provisions that could require the posting of collateral. 

        In
addition to the above, certain international subsidiaries of Kraft maintain credit lines to meet the short-term working capital needs of the international businesses.
These credit lines, which amounted to approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005, are for the sole use of the Company's international businesses. Borrowings on these lines
amounted to approximately $400 million and $150 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NAME="page_dy1135_1_69">   
        Kraft repurchases its Class A common stock in open market transactions. During December 2004, the Company began a $1.5 billion two-year share repurchase
program. During 2005, the Company repurchased 39.2 million shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, an average price of $30.65 per share. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased 40.6 million shares of its Class A common stock, under its $1.5 billion authority, at an aggregate cost of
$1.25 billion. During December 2004, Kraft completed its multi-year $700 million Class A common stock repurchase program, acquiring 21,718,847 Class A
shares at an average price of $32.23 per share. During December 2003, Kraft completed its $500 million Class A common stock repurchase program, acquiring 15,308,458 Class A
shares at an average price of $32.66 per share. 

        Class B
common shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were 1.18 billion. Altria Group, Inc. holds 276.5 million Class A
common shares and all of the Class B common shares at December 31, 2005. There are no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Class A common shares are entitled to one vote each,
while Class B common shares are entitled to ten votes each. Therefore, Altria Group, Inc. holds 98.3% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock at
December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, 170,243,228 shares of common stock were reserved for stock options and other stock awards. 

Note 11.    Stock Plans:  

        In 2005, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders approved, the Kraft 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"). The 2005 Plan
replaced the Company's 2001 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"). Under the 2005 Plan, the Company may grant to eligible employees awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted and deferred stock units, and other awards based on the Company's Class A common stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive
awards. A maximum of 150 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock may be issued under the 2005 Plan, of which no more than 45 million shares may be awarded as
restricted stock. In addition, the Company may grant up to 500,000 shares of Class A common stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not full-time employees of the
Company or Altria Group, Inc., or their subsidiaries, under the Kraft Directors Plan (the "2001 Directors Plan"). Shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan and the 2001 Directors Plan
at December 31, 2005, were 149,879,210 and 439,367, respectively. Restricted shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2005, were 44,879,210. 


        The
Company applies the intrinsic value-based methodology in accounting for the various stock plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized other than for restricted
stock awards. In 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"). SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure compensation cost for
share-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt this new standard prospectively, on January 1, 2006, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

        Prior to the IPO, certain employees of the Company participated in Altria Group, Inc.'s stock compensation plans. Altria Group, Inc. does not intend
to issue additional Altria Group, Inc. stock compensation to the Company's employees, except for reloads of previously issued options. Altria Group, Inc. accounts for its plans in
accordance with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which did not result in compensation cost for stock options.

        Had
compensation cost for stock option awards under the Kraft plans and Altria Group, Inc. plans been determined by using the fair value at the grant date, the Company's net
earnings and basic and diluted EPS would have been $2,625 million, $1.56 and $1.55, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005; $2,658 million, $1.56 and $1.55,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004; and $3,464 million, $2.01 and $2.00, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003. The foregoing impact of compensation

        The Company may grant shares of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock to eligible employees, giving them in most instances all of the rights of
stockholders, except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such shares and rights. Such shares and rights are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company granted approximately 4.2 million, 4.1 million and 3.7 million restricted Class A shares, respectively, to eligible U.S.-based
employees, and during 2005, 2004 and 2003, also issued to eligible non-U.S. employees rights to receive approximately 1.8 million, 1.9 million and 1.6 million
Class A equivalent shares, respectively. The market value per restricted share or right was $33.32, $32.23 and $36.56 on the dates of the 2005, 2004 and 2003 grants, respectively. At
December 31, 2005, restrictions on these shares and rights, net of forfeitures, lapse as follows: 2006—4,140,552 shares; 2007—5,079,097 shares;
2008—5,596,297 shares; 2009—100,000 shares; 2010—69,170 shares; and 2012—100,000 shares. 

        The
fair value of the shares of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over the restriction period. The Company
recorded compensation expense related to the restricted stock and rights of $148 million, $106 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The unamortized portion, which is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of shareholders' equity, was $202 million and $190 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Note 12.    Earnings Per Share:  

        Basic and diluted EPS from continuing and discontinued operations were calculated using the following:

received
upon stock option exercise or, in the case of restricted stock and rights, the number of shares corresponding to the unamortized compensation expense. For 2005 and 2004, the number of stock
options excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive (i.e. the cash that would be received upon exercise is greater than the average
market price of the stock during the period) was immaterial. For the 2003 computation, 18 million Class A common stock options were excluded from the calculation of weighted average
shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive.

        The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes additional tax expense of $280 million from the sale of the
sugar confectionery business. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, included a deferred income tax benefit of $43 million. 

        At
December 31, 2005, applicable United States federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.6 billion of accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested. 


        In
October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("the Jobs Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Act includes a deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated.
In 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $500 million of earnings under the provisions of the Jobs Act. Deferred taxes had previously been provided for a portion of the dividends to be
remitted. The reversal of the deferred taxes more than offset the tax costs to repatriate the earnings and resulted in a net tax reduction of $28 million in the consolidated income tax
provision during 2005, the majority of which was recorded during the second quarter. 

72




 


        The
Jobs Act also provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction related to a percentage of the lesser of "qualified production activities income" or
taxable income. The deduction, which was 3% in 2005, increases to 9% by 2010. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, the Company will recognize these benefits in the year earned. The tax benefit in
2005 was approximately $25 million. 

        The
effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003:

        The tax rate in 2005 includes the settlement of an outstanding U.S. tax claim of $24 million in the second quarter; $82 million from the resolution
of outstanding items in the Company's international operations, the majority of which was in the first quarter, and $33 million of tax impacts associated with the sale of a U.S. biscuit brand.
The 2005 rate also includes a $53 million aggregate benefit from the domestic manufacturers' deduction provision and the dividend repatriation provision of the Jobs Act. The tax provision in
2004 includes an $81 million favorable resolution of an outstanding tax item, the majority of which occurred in the third quarter of 2004, and the reversal of $35 million of tax accruals
that were no longer required due to tax events that occurred during the first quarter of 2004. 


        The
Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and these audits are at various stages at any given time. The Company anticipates several domestic and
foreign audits will close in 2006 with favorable settlements. Any tax contingency reserves in excess of additional assessed liabilities will be reversed at the time the audits close. 

        The
tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2005 and 2004:

        To conform with the current year's presentation, the amounts shown above at December 31, 2004 have been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect
state deferred tax amounts that were previously included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. As a result, deferred income

tax
liabilities on the December 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet increased $618 million from $5,850 million to $6,468 million, with a corresponding reduction in other
liabilities. 

Note 14.    Segment Reporting:  

        The Company manufactures and markets packaged food products, consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various packaged grocery
products. Kraft manages and reports operating results through two units, Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial. Reportable segments for Kraft North America Commercial are
organized and managed principally by product category. Kraft North America Commercial's segments are U.S. Beverages; U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice; U.S. Convenient Meals; U.S.
Grocery; and U.S. Snacks & Cereals. Kraft International Commercial's operations are organized and managed by geographic location. Kraft International Commercial's segments are Europe, Middle
East & Africa; and Latin America & Asia Pacific. 

        In
October 2005, the Company announced that, effective January 1, 2006, its Canadian business will be realigned to better integrate it into the Company's North American
business by product category. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the operating results of the Canadian business will be reported throughout the North American food segments. In addition, in the
first quarter of 2006, the Company's international businesses will be realigned to reflect the reorganization announced within Europe in November 2005. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006,
the operating results of the Company's international businesses will be reported in two revised segments—European Union; and to reflect increased management attention to the reporting in
the Company's developing markets—Developing Markets, Oceania and North Asia. Accordingly, prior period segment results will be restated. 

        The
Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.
Interest and other debt expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are not included in the measure of
segment profitability reviewed by management. The Company's assets, which are principally in the United States and Europe, are managed geographically. The accounting policies of the segments are the
same as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Note 15.    Benefit Plans:  

        The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Pension coverage for employees of the Company's
non-U.S. subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local statutory requirements. In addition, the Company's U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to substantially all retired employees. Health care benefits for retirees outside the United States and Canada are generally covered
through local government plans. 

        The
plan assets and benefit obligations of the Company's U.S. and Canadian pension plans are measured at December 31 of each year and all other non-U.S. pension plans
are measured at September 30 of each year. The benefit obligations of the Company's postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.

        The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net prepaid pension asset of $2,385 million and $2,404 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts were recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, as prepaid pension assets of
$3,617 million and $3,569 million, respectively, for those plans in which plan assets exceeded their accumulated benefit obligations, and as other liabilities of $1,232 million
and $1,165 million, respectively, for plans in which the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded their plan assets. 


        For
U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the change in the additional minimum liability in 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

        The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the U.S. pension plans was $5,580 million and $5,327 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $3,494 million and $3,251 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

        At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, certain of the Company's U.S. pension plans were underfunded, with projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value
of plan assets of $268 million, $211 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2005, and $260 million, $188 million and $11 million, respectively, in 2004.
The majority of these relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. For certain non-U.S. plans, which have accumulated benefit obligations in excess
of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $2,134 million, $1,993 million and $1,088 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2005, and $2,012 million, $1,877 million and $950 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. 

        The
following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the Company's benefit obligations under the plans at December 31:

        The Company's 2005 year end U.S. and Canadian plans discount rates were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments
with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. The 2005 year end discount rates for the Company's non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond
indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible.

        During 2005, employees left the Company under workforce reduction programs, resulting in settlement losses of $10 million for the U.S. plans. In addition,
retiring employees elected lump-sum payments, resulting in settlement losses of $73 million, $41 million and $51 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Non-U.S. plant closures and early retirement benefits resulted in curtailment and settlement losses of $25 million and $7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

        The
Company's expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of
future long-term returns by asset class. 

        Kraft
and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor employee savings plans, to which the Company contributes. These plans cover certain salaried, non-union and union employees. The
Company's contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled
$94 million, $92 million and $84 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 



 Plan Assets  



        The percentage of fair value of pension plan assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was as follows:

        The Company's investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly, the
composition of the Company's U.S. plan assets is broadly characterized as a 70%/30% allocation between equity and debt securities. The strategy utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities, actively
managed international equity securities and actively managed investment grade debt securities (which constitute 80% or more of debt securities) with lesser allocations to high yield and international
debt securities. 

        For
the plans outside the U.S., the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. These specific
circumstances result in a level of equity exposure that is typically less than the U.S. plans. In aggregate, the actual asset allocations of the non-U.S. plans are virtually identical to
their respective asset policy targets. 

        The
Company attempts to mitigate investment risk by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as the Company's contributions and monthly benefit payments are made. 

        The
Company presently makes, and plans to make, contributions, to the extent that they do not generate an excise tax liability, in order to maintain plan assets in excess of the
accumulated benefit obligation of its funded U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Currently, the Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $140 million in 2006 to its U.S. plans
and approximately $106 million in 2006 to its non-U.S. plans, based on current tax law. However, these estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors, including changes
in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or significant changes in interest rates.

        In December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act
establishes a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as "Medicare Part D," and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. 

        In
May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service as an
actuarial experience gain and as a reduction of the service cost component of net postretirement health care costs for amounts attributable to current service, if the benefit provided is at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. 

        The
Company adopted FSP 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004. The impact for 2005 and 2004 was a reduction of pre-tax net postretirement health care costs
and an increase in net earnings. The amounts in the table above reflect the following benefits:

        In addition, as of July 1, 2004, the Company reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to
past service by $315 million and decreased its unrecognized actuarial losses by the same amount.

Note 17.    Financial Instruments:  

Derivative financial instruments  

        The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments to manage
its foreign currency and commodity exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged
period. The Company formally documents the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for
undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the
forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur,
the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings currently. 

        The
Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and
forecasted transactions. Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are effective as hedges. The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed, based on the size and
location of its 

85




 


businesses,
include the euro, Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had foreign exchange option and forward contracts with aggregate
notional amounts of $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with forward and option contracts is deferred as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings. 

        The
Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by its businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward
contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for coffee and cocoa. Commodity futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar
and soybean oil. In general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore, not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had net long commodity positions of $521 million and $443 million, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net commodity positions
were immaterial at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive earnings (losses) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings when the related inventory is sold. 


        Ineffectiveness
related to cash flow hedges was not material for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, the Company was hedging forecasted
transactions for periods not exceeding the next fifteen months. At December 31, 2005, the Company estimates that derivative losses of approximately $2 million, net of income taxes,
reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next twelve months. 

        Derivative
gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of gains or losses from accumulated other
comprehensive earnings (losses) to earnings are offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item. Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses), net
of income taxes, during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as follows (in millions):

Credit exposure and credit risk  

        The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance, and such exposure
was not material at December 31, 2005. 

Fair value  

        The aggregate fair value, based on market quotes, of the Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2005, was $10,750 million as compared with its
carrying value of $10,548 million. The aggregate fair value of the Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2004, was $12,835 million as compared with its carrying value of
$12,291 million. 

        See
Notes 4, 8 and 9 for additional disclosures of fair value for short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

Note 18.    Contingencies:  

        Kraft and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including a few cases in which substantial
amounts of damages are sought. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 



 Third-Party Guarantees  



        At December 31, 2005, the Company's third-party guarantees, which are primarily derived from acquisition and divestiture activities, approximated
$27 million. Substantially all of these guarantees expire through 2013, with $14 million expiring during 2006. The Company is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that
a third party fails to make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. The Company has a liability of $17 million on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005,
relating to these guarantees.

        As
discussed in Note 13. Income Taxes, Kraft has recognized income tax benefits in the consolidated statements of earnings during
2005 and 2004 as a result of various tax events, including the benefits earned under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. 


Note 20.    Subsequent Event:  

        In January 2006, the Company announced plans to continue its restructuring efforts beyond those originally contemplated (see Note 3.  Asset Impairment,
Exit and Implementation Costs). Additional pre-tax charges are anticipated to be $2.5 billion from 2006 to 2009, of
which approximately $1.6 billion are expected to require cash payments. These charges will result in the anticipated closure of up to 20 additional facilities and the elimination of
approximately 8,000 additional positions. Initiatives under the expanded program include additional organizational
streamlining and facility closures. The entire restructuring program is expected to ultimately result in $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges, the closure of up to 40 facilities and the
elimination of approximately 14,000 positions. Approximately $2.3 billion of the $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures.        


        The Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and
determined that there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
