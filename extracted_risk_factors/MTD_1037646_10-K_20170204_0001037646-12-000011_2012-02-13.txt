.Risk FactorsFactors Affecting Our Future Operating ResultsThe majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries. Continued   economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely affect our operating results.Although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing, the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries.  Economic instability in many parts of the world, including the potential for a sovereign debt crisis in the European Union and the United States, continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely.  Concerns regarding this potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets.  More specifically, an escalation of the European debt crisis could have the following adverse effects:•A substantial drop in demand for our products because of the basic inability of companies to complete commercial transactions•Severe limits on the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses•Unavailability of liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all•The inability to obtain materials and supplies•Potential devaluation and/or impairment of assets•Increased accounts receivable write-offs•Difficulty in collecting accounts receivables•Potential disputes about the currency of payment under various contractual arrangements for the purchases and sales of goods and services•Increased foreign exchange rate volatility that could result in unexpected changes in profitability and cash flow        Because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in uncertain or difficult economic times, economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results.  Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve.  These conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability.Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits.We conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency (the Eurozone). Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro, and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in affect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse affect on the global capital markets, and more specifically 13Table of Contentson the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products.We are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets.We conduct business in many countries, including emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings. For example, our Chinese operations account for $388.6 million of sales to external customers, approximately 30% of our global production, and $120.9 million of segment profit during 2011. In addition to the currency risks discussed below, international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance, various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks:•tariffs and trade barriers;•difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and/or mandatory salary increases for local employees;•credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors;•difficulties in protecting intellectual property;•nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property, plant and equipment, inventory and accounts receivable, as well as $68.4 million of cash at December 31, 2011 in our Chinese subsidiaries;•restrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership;•adverse tax consequences, including tax disputes, imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and•other uncertain local economic, political and social conditions, including hyper-inflationary conditions or periods of low or no productivity growth.We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies. For example, converting earnings from our operations in China into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of China.While business activity in emerging markets improved during 2011, fluctuating economic conditions may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future. Certain emerging markets have also experienced currency devaluations and inflationary prices. Economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies, adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets. We remain committed to emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. However, fluctuating economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations in these markets.We operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins, gain market share and maintain a technological advantage.Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we 14Table of Contentsface numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. Some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages.We are vulnerable to system failures, including those that may be related to cyber security attacks, which could harm our business.We rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, support our customers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures.We also are in the process of implementing our Blue Ocean program, a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. The implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis over a multi year period with the initial go-live rollout having occurred in 2010. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our Swiss and Chinese operations and now have approximately one-third of the program completed as measured in users. We expect to implement Germany and the United States over the next two years and will then have more than half of the Company's users on the system. If the implementation of any unit is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer-facing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition, or cause us to lose data, experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information. It may take us longer to implement the Blue Ocean program than we have planned, and the project may cost us more than we have estimated, either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies. In addition, the implementation of Blue Ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption.Our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted.An interruption in our business due to events such as disruptions with our supply chain, natural disasters, pandemics or other health crises, fires or explosions may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers. It may be expensive to resolve these issues, even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.15Table of ContentsOur product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner.We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In developing new products, we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities.A widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business, making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.In recent years, a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) or, in the Asia Pacific region, outbreaks of SARS and/or avian influenza (bird flu). Despite the implementation of certain precautions, we are susceptible to such outbreaks. As a result of such outbreaks, businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined. Outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these, particularly in North America, Europe, China or other locations significant to our operations, could adversely affect general commercial activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. If our operations are curtailed because of health issues, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. In addition, a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products. Further, if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical, food, food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results.Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years. A prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control, including the resources available for purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability.We may face risks associated with future acquisitions.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations, technologies and products; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company. If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future, completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets. Any of these acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our 16Table of Contentsprofitability.Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering, which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results.If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating results could be harmed.Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection, and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed. Competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand. Although we take measures to protect confidential information, improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome, and management attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing activity and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result in a decline in our revenues.Departures of key employees could impair our operations.We generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees. Our executive officers own shares of our common stock and/or have options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless, such individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors, which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives.We may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances.We incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.17Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations.Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products, from design and development, to product safety, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.We may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $447.7 million and other intangible assets of $121.4 million.Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections. In preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits.In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a 18Table of Contentsgoverning tax authority could affect our profitability.Currency fluctuations affect our operating profits.Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our total net sales. In part, this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in Switzerland relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. In addition, we have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses. Therefore, when the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross-rate that we monitor. We have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past, and recently the Swiss franc has strengthened against the euro. The average exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro was 1.23 during 2011 as compared to 1.39 for the prior year, reflecting a 12% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro. The current exchange rate for the Swiss franc to the euro is 1.21 as of February 8, 2012, reflecting a 2% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2011. We estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of $1.6 million to $2.2 million on an annual basis. In addition to the Swiss franc and major European currencies, we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately $4.4 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the debt.We have debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.We have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2011, we had total indebtedness of approximately $269.4 million, net of cash of $235.6 million. We are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein.The existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development and other corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments.19Table of ContentsThe agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business.The note purchase agreement governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios.Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and is subject to the risks in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreement governing the senior notes and/or under our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.The lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments, reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity.We have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to $870 million. Our credit facility is provided by a group of 16 financial institutions, who individually have between 1% and 14% of the total funding commitment. At December 31, 2011, we had borrowings of $376.7 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available. Even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to borrow the full $870 million.We make from time to time forward-looking statements, and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors.We from time to time provide forward-looking statements both in our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated earnings per share. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors. We refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “Factors affecting our future operating results” in the “Business” section and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this annual report on Form 10-K, which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict these new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.20Table of ContentsIn providing guidance on our future earnings, our management evaluates our budgets, our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business. This evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors. Some of the key external assumptions include:•the outlook for our end markets and the global economy;•impact of external factors on our competition;•financial position of our customers;•the estimated costs of purchasing materials;•developments in personnel costs; and•rates for currency exchange, particularly between the Swiss franc and the euro.Some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time. For example, although no one customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of operations.Some of our key internal assumptions include the following:•our ability to implement our business strategy;•the effectiveness of our marketing programs such as our Spinnaker initiatives;•our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services;•the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets;•our ability to implement price increases as forecasted; and•the effectiveness of our cost saving initiatives.These internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets, price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products. Furthermore, we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs.We believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results different than our projections.Our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control.Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to an extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those described in this section, that are beyond our control.We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.21Table of ContentsItem 1B
