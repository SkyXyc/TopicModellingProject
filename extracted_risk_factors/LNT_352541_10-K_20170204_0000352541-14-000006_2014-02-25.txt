Where appropriate, information relating to a specific entity has been segregated and labeled as such.  Unless otherwise noted, the information herein excludes discontinued operations for all periods presented.ITEM 1. BUSINESSA. GENERALAlliant Energy was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1981 and maintains its principal executive offices in Madison, Wisconsin.  Alliant Energy operates as a regulated investor-owned public utility holding company.  Alliant Energy’s primary focus is to provide regulated electricity and natural gas service to approximately 1 million electric and approximately 418,000 natural gas customers in the Midwest through its two public utility subsidiaries, IPL and WPL.  The primary first tier wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alliant Energy are: IPL, WPL, Resources and Corporate Services.  A brief description of the primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy is as follows:1) IPL - was incorporated in 1925 in Iowa as Iowa Railway and Light Corporation.  IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in Iowa and southern Minnesota.  In Iowa, IPL provides utility services to incorporated communities as directed by the IUB and utilizes non-exclusive franchises, which cover the use of public right-of-ways for utility facilities in incorporated communities for a maximum term of 25 years.  At December 31, 2013, IPL supplied electric and natural gas service to 528,355 and 234,563 retail customers, respectively.  IPL is also engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  In 2013, 2012 and 2011, IPL had no single customer for which electric, gas, steam and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of IPL’s consolidated revenues.  Refer to Note 3(a) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of IPL’s proposed sales of its Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets.2) WPL - was incorporated in 1917 in Wisconsin as Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company.  WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in southern and central Wisconsin.  WPL operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of indefinite duration and state statutes authorizing utility operation in areas annexed by a municipality.  At December 31, 2013, WPL supplied electric 5Table of Contentsand natural gas service to 460,396 and 182,647 retail customers, respectively.  In 2013, 2012 and 2011, WPL had no single customer for which electric, gas and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of WPL’s consolidated revenues.  At December 31, 2013, WPL Transco was a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPL and held WPL’s investment in ATC.3) RESOURCES - was incorporated in 1988 in Wisconsin.  In 2008, Resources was converted to a limited liability company.  Alliant Energy’s non-regulated investments are organized under Resources.  Refer to “Information Relating to Non-regulated Operations” for additional details.4) CORPORATE SERVICES - was incorporated in 1997 in Iowa.  Corporate Services provides administrative services to Alliant Energy, IPL, WPL and Resources.Refer to Note 17 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of business segments, which information is incorporated herein by reference.B. INFORMATION RELATING TO ALLIANT ENERGY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS1) EMPLOYEES - At December 31, 2013, Alliant Energy’s consolidated subsidiaries had the following full- and part-time employees: Number of Number of Total Percentage of Employees Bargaining Unit Other Number of Covered by Collective Employees Employees Employees Bargaining AgreementsIPL1,119 557 1,676 67%WPL1,026 251 1,277 80%Corporate Services25 853 878 3%Resources85 29 114 75% 2,255 1,690 3,945 57%At December 31, 2013, Alliant Energy employees covered by collective bargaining agreements were as follows: Number of Contract Employees Expiration DateIPL:   IBEW Local 204 (Cedar Rapids)757 8/31/17IBEW - Various362 Various 1,119  WPL - IBEW Local 9651,026 5/31/14Resources - Various85 VariousCorporate Services - IBEW Local 20425 10/31/14 2,255  2) CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND INVESTMENT PLANS - Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows - Investing Activities - Construction and Acquisition Expenditures” in MDA for discussion of anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for 2014 through 2017.3) REGULATION - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies.  The following includes the primary regulations impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.FERC -Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 - Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to PUHCA, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities, service company and other entities regulated by FERC.  Corporate Services, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA for various matters including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books, records and accounting requirements.Energy Policy Act - The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an ERO to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC designated NERC as the overarching ERO.  MRO, which is a regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.6Table of ContentsFederal Power Act - FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and transmission rates, dividend payments, issuance of securities (only IPL, and Corporate Services through March 31, 2014) and accounting practices of Corporate Services, IPL and WPL.Electric Wholesale Rates - IPL and WPL have received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from FERC.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of electricity within the MISO and PJM markets and in bilateral markets, based on the market value of the transactions.  IPL and WPL also have FERC-approved cost-of-service based rates related to the provision of firm full- and partial-requirement wholesale electric sales.  Both IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale cost-of-service tariffs are formula-based tariffs that allow for true-ups to actual costs, including fuel costs.Electric Transmission Rates - FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  Neither IPL nor WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates.  IPL and WPL rely primarily on the use of the ITC and ATC transmission systems, respectively.  Due to the formula rates used by ITC and ATC to charge their customers and possible future changes to these rates, there is uncertainty regarding IPL’s and WPL’s future electric transmission service expenses.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for further discussion of electric transmission service charges.Natural Gas Act - FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.IUB - IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in Iowa for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and construction of EGUs.Retail Utility Base Rates - IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate changes.  These filings are based on historical test periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable changes to capital investments, cost of capital and operating and maintenance expenses consistent with IUB rules and regulations.  Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10 days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past precedent.  The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate changes within 10 months of the date of the application for which changes are filed, or the interim rates granted become permanent.Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms - IPL’s retail electric and natural gas tariffs contain automatic adjustment clauses for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers in Iowa.  Any over- or under-collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery Mechanism - Electric transmission service expenses are billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider.  This cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to Iowa retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses.  Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are reflected in future billings to customers.  The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s final decision in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, at which time the rider will continue in its current form, continue in a modified form or be terminated.Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Mechanism - In accordance with Iowa law, IPL is required to file an EEP every five years with the IUB.  An EEP provides a utility’s plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of energy savings.  IUB approval demonstrates that the IUB believes that IPL’s EEP is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective delivery of the energy efficiency programs.  To the extent approved by the IUB, costs associated with executing the EEP are recovered from ratepayers through an additional tariff called an EECR factor.  The EECR factors are revised annually and include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expenses from prior periods.Electric Generating Units - IPL must obtain a GCU Certificate from the IUB in order to construct a new or significantly alter an existing EGU located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of capacity.Advance Rate-making Principles - Iowa law provides Iowa utilities with rate-making principles prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa.  As a result, IPL must file for, and the IUB must render a decision on, rate-making principles for EGUs located in Iowa, including new base-load (nuclear or coal-fired generation) EGUs with a nameplate generating capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired EGUs of any size and renewable generating resources, such 7Table of Contentsas wind facilities, of any size.  Upon approval of rate-making principles by the IUB, IPL must either build the EGU under the approved rate-making principles, or not at all.Electric Generating Unit Emission Controls Projects - IPL is required to submit an EPB biennially to the IUB setting out a multi-year plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its EGUs in a cost-effective manner.  IPL must simultaneously submit this plan and budget to the Iowa DNR for a determination of whether the plan and budget meet state environmental requirements for regulated emissions.  The reasonable costs associated with implementing the plan are expected to be included in IPL’s future retail electric rates.PSCW - Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other matters.  WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, affiliate transactions, approval of the location and construction of EGUs and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.Retail Utility Base Rates - WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate changes.  These filings are required to be based on forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide retail base rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts to process retail base rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -Electric - WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of annual fuel-related costs anticipated during the test period.  During each retail electric rate proceeding, or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding, the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges.  Deferrals of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the applicable authorized return on common equity.  Subject to review and approval by the PSCW, any deferred over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs for each year are reflected in future billings to retail customers.Natural Gas - WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas costs required to serve its retail gas customers.  Any over- or under-collection of natural gas costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Mechanism - WPL contributes a certain percentage of its annual utility revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin’s state-wide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program.  Estimated contributions to Focus on Energy, along with WPL-run energy efficiency program costs, are recovered from WPL’s retail customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings and include a reconciliation of such estimated amounts to actual costs incurred with any difference deferred for inclusion in future base rate changes.New Electric Generating Units - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new EGU with a capacity of less than 100 MW.  WPL must obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the PSCW in order to construct a new EGU in Wisconsin with a capacity of 100 MW or more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of EGUs (including those located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.Electric Generating Unit Upgrades - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any additions to EGUs, including emission controls projects that exceed a certain threshold amount.  The current PSCW rules require a CA for projects with an estimated project cost of $10 million or more.Advance Rate-making Principles - Wisconsin law provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate-making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled EGU or renewable generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.  WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate-making terms or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.8Table of ContentsMPUC - IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in Minnesota for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, affiliate transactions, and approval of the location and construction of EGUs located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.Retail Utility Rates - Requests for retail rate change can be based on either historical or projected data and interim retail rates are permitted.  IPL has historically requested retail rate relief based on historical test periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL and operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months after the end of the test year.  Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief; however, the MPUC can extend the timing by 90 days.Renewable Energy Cost Recovery Mechanism - In 2011, IPL received an order from the MPUC approving the implementation of an automatic cost recovery rider on a temporary basis to recover costs associated with renewable generation.  The renewable energy rider does not require a base rate case for annual revision of rates charged to IPL’s Minnesota retail electric customers, but requires that the renewable energy costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues collected for such costs.  IPL utilizes this mechanism to recover costs associated with its Whispering Willow - East wind project located in Iowa.Refer to Note 3(a) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of IPL’s proposed sales of its Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets.Environmental - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations as a result of their current and past operations.  The environmental laws and regulations relate to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing air emissions; water discharges; the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials; and the clean-up of contaminated sites, including former MGP sites.The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management, transportation and clean-up, and solid waste management requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental programs to local agencies.Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL regularly obtain federal, state and local permits to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the future.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL anticipate that prudently incurred compliance and remediation costs for IPL and WPL will be recoverable, in whole or part, through future rate case proceedings.  Refer to “Environmental Matters” in MDA and Note 16(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of electric and gas environmental matters, including current or proposed environmental regulations.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Environmental Compliance Plans” in MDA for details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s future environmental compliance plans to adhere to applicable environmental requirements.Refer to Notes 1(b), 1(g), 2 and 16(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and “Rate Matters” and “Environmental Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and utility rate matters.4) STRATEGIC OVERVIEW - Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of various strategic actions by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.C. INFORMATION RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONSAlliant Energy’s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL’s steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business.  In 2013, IPL’s and WPL’s operating revenues and operating income (loss) for these three utility business segments were as follows: IPL WPL Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Revenues Income (Loss)Electric82% 82% 85% 92%Gas15% 14% 14% 9%Other3% 4% 1% (1%) 100% 100% 100% 100%9Table of Contents1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONSGeneral - Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing electric service in Iowa and southern Minnesota and WPL providing electric service in southern and central Wisconsin.  In September 2013, IPL signed a definitive agreement to sell its Minnesota electric distribution assets.  Refer to Note 3(a) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of this proposed sale.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding electric utility operations.Jurisdictions - Electric utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount PercentIPL:           Iowa$1,416.3 52% $1,295.5 50% $1,327.2 50%Minnesota75.5 3% 75.6 3% 81.1 3%Subtotal1,491.8 55% 1,371.1 53% 1,408.3 53%WPL:           Wisconsin1,197.2 45% 1,218.2 47% 1,227.5 47% $2,689.0 100% $2,589.3 100% $2,635.8 100%The percentage of electric utility revenues regulated by the IUB, PSCW, MPUC and FERC were as follows: IPL WPL 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011IUB93% 92% 90% —% —% —%PSCW—% —% —% 85% 86% 85%MPUC5% 5% 6% —% —% —%FERC2% 3% 4% 15% 14% 15% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%Customers - The number of electric customers and communities served at December 31, 2013 was as follows: Retail Customers Wholesale Customers Other Customers Total Customers Communities ServedIPL528,355 8 1,366 529,729 752WPL460,396 21 2,262 462,679 607 988,751 29 3,628 992,408 1,359IPL and WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the food manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol) and paper industries.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB or MPUC that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and recovery of purchased electric capacity costs and other costs required to serve customers.  Electric transmission service expenses are billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider.  This cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to Iowa electric retail customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses.  IPL’s fuel-related costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and recovery of fuel-related costs, purchased electric capacity costs, electric transmission service costs and other costs required to serve customers.  WPL defers fuel-related costs that exceed or fall below established fuel monitoring ranges through an electric fuel cost recovery mechanism.  WPL’s recovery of deferred fuel-related costs is restricted if it earns in excess of its authorized return on common equity.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for details of IPL’s plans to file an Iowa retail electric base rate case and WPL’s plans to file a retail electric and gas base rate case in late March 2014.  Refer to Note 2 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of utility rate cases.Wholesale customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings.  The tariffs include an annual true-up process for actual costs incurred.  A majority of IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale service agreements have terms that end after 2016.  Refer to Note 3(a) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution asset sales agreement, which includes a wholesale power supply agreement that is subject to FERC approval.10Table of ContentsIn addition, WPL has bulk power customers, included in “Other customers” in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated, long-term customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.Seasonality - Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements.  Electric sales are also impacted to a certain extent in the winter months due to heating requirements.  In 2013, the maximum peak hour demands were as follows: Alliant Energy IPL WPLMW5,820 3,107 2,752DateJuly 17 July 17 July 18Competition - Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier, and IPL and WPL have obligations to serve all their retail electric customers.  Although electric service in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, owners of distributed generation, alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).  However, IPL and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an effort to keep energy rates low for all its customers.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for discussion of litigation related to a renewable power developer seeking to distribute energy in IPL’s service territory, which may impact IPL’s future electric sales.In 2010, the PSCW approved an economic development program, which is intended to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s service territory.  The program permits WPL to enter into a contract with eligible industrial customers for a discounted energy rate based upon specifically-defined conditions through December 2014.  To be eligible for the program, each customer needs to demonstrate that it is also eligible for direct governmental assistance through a local, state or federal economic development program, in addition to other criteria.  The discount amounts are limited to ensure recovery of marginal costs and will be decreased over time until a customer is paying the full tariff rate.  Currently, there are three WPL customers utilizing the economic development program.Renewable Energy Standards - As discussed in greater detail below, the states in which IPL and WPL operate have RES, which establish the amount of energy electric utilities or service providers must supply from renewable resources.IPL - IPL has requirements to comply with RES in both Iowa and Minnesota and primarily relies upon RECs generated from the wind projects it owns and renewable energy acquired under PPAs to meet such requirements.  IPL allocates its portfolio of RECs between its Iowa and Minnesota jurisdictions based on a load-ratio share.  IPL has excess RECs in Iowa and a shortfall of RECs in Minnesota.  However, the excess RECs in Iowa are much larger than the Minnesota shortfall partially due to the relatively small amount of IPL’s load served in Minnesota compared to Iowa.  IPL’s surplus of RECs in Iowa are permitted to be used to meet the deficit of RECs in Minnesota.  IPL expects to meet both its Iowa and Minnesota renewable energy requirements on a system-wide basis without the need to purchase additional RECs.Iowa - IPL is required to purchase or own 49.8 MW of nameplate capacity from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in its service area.  IPL currently exceeds this Iowa requirement.Minnesota - IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with renewable energy sources must be at least 12% currently and 17% by 2016, 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2025.  Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES with renewable energy generated by the utility, renewable energy acquired under PPAs, or the use of accumulated or acquired RECs.  IPL has met the 12% requirement and currently expects to satisfy future Minnesota RES requirements with its current wind generation and wind PPAs, supplemented as needed by acquiring additional RECs from its anticipated Iowa excess supply.In addition to the above Minnesota requirement, IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with solar power must be at least 1.5% by 2020.  IPL currently estimates that approximately 10 MW of solar power would be needed for compliance with this requirement by 2020.11Table of ContentsWPL - The Wisconsin RES requires WPL to increase the portion of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in 2001, 2002 and 2003.  The RES required a 2% increase above the benchmark by 2010 and will require a 6% increase above the benchmark by 2015.  Based on this RES, WPL was required to supply a minimum of 5.28% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by 2010 and will be required to increase this amount to 9.28% by 2015.  WPL may reach the RES with renewable energy it generates, it acquires under PPAs or through the use of renewable resource credits.  WPL has met the 2010 requirements of this RES and currently expects to meet the 2015 requirements of the RES with its current renewable portfolio, which primarily consists of wind and hydro.Energy Conservation - IPL and WPL continue to promote energy conservation, including their customers’ ability to efficiently manage their energy use.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of energy efficiency programs at IPL and WPL.Electric Supply - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have met historical customer demand of electricity and expect to continue meeting future demand through a mix of electric supply including internally generated electricity, PPAs and additional purchases from wholesale energy markets.  Alliant Energy’s mix of electric supply changed in recent years with WPL’s purchases of the Neenah Energy Facility in 2009, Wisconsin Electric Power Company’s 25% interest in Edgewater Unit 5 in 2011 and Riverside in 2012, the completion of wind projects including IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project in 2009 and WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in 2011, and IPL’s retirement of various EGUs.  Alliant Energy expects its mix of electric supply to change further in the next several years with IPL’s construction of Marshalltown, WPL’s potential generation investment, IPL’s new DAEC PPA for a term of February 22, 2014 through December 31, 2025, WPL’s new 150 MW PPA for a term from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018, the expiration of WPL’s Kewaunee PPA in December 2013 and the proposed retirement of additional EGUs.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically update their generation plans to identify longer term electric supply resource needs.  These long-term generation plans are intended to meet customer demand, reduce reliance on PPAs and wholesale market purchases and mitigate the impacts of future EGU retirements while maintaining compliance with long-term electric demand PRMs, environmental requirements and RES established by regulators.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to meet utility customer demand in the future.  However, unanticipated regional or local reliability issues could still arise in the event of unexpected delays in the construction of new generating and/or transmission facilities, retirement of EGUs, EGU outages, transmission system outages or extended periods of extreme weather conditions.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for a profile of the sources of electric supply used to meet customer demand for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL from 2009 to 2013.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s future generation plans.Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin - IPL and WPL are required to maintain a PRM above their load at the time of the MISO-wide peak to ensure reliability of electric service to their customers.  The installed capacity reserve margin is 14.8% and the unforced capacity reserve margin is 7.3% for the June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 MISO planning year.  IPL and WPL currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements for the June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 MISO planning year.Beginning with the June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014 MISO planning year, MISO implemented an LRZ concept.  The purpose of the LRZ concept is to encourage adequate generating resources adjacent to the load served by such generating resources.  IPL is located in LRZ No. 3, which covers the entire state of Iowa and a portion of southern Minnesota.  WPL is located in LRZ No. 2, which covers the southern and eastern portions of Wisconsin and upper peninsula of Michigan.  Subject to certain zonal transfer capacity limits, load-serving utilities (including IPL and WPL) are permitted to have generating capacity located outside of their respective LRZs if they procure firm point-to-point transmission service to import the capacity from another LRZ.  If a utility chooses to import capacity from another LRZ without firm point-to-point transmission service, it will incur a zonal delivery charge.  Neither IPL nor WPL have current generating capacity located outside of their respective LRZs; therefore they do not expect to be subject to zonal delivery charges during the June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 MISO planning years.Generation - IPL and WPL own a portfolio of EGUs located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to “Properties” in Item 2 for details of IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs.12Table of ContentsGenerating Capacity - The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs based on nameplate capacity by primary fuel type is as follows (in MWs): IPL WPL TotalCoal1,617 1,338 2,955Natural gas1,031 1,448 2,479Oil349 — 349Wind200 269 469Hydro— 41 41Total3,197 3,096 6,293Fuel Costs - The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric generation was as follows: IPL WPL 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011All fuels$2.36 $2.26 $2.18 $2.52 $2.26 $2.28Coal1.99 1.91 1.86 2.21 2.21 2.22Natural gas (a)4.63 3.79 7.17 4.86 3.21 6.30(a)The average cost of natural gas includes commodity and transportation costs as well as gains and losses from swap and option contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by IPL’s and WPL’s natural gas-fired EGUs.Coal - Coal is the primary fuel source for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally generated electric supply and represented approximately 40% to 60% of their total sources of electric energy in 2013.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired EGUs for 2014 through 2018.  As of December 31, 2013, existing contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 76%, 69%, 57%, 30% and 20% of IPL’s and WPL’s estimated aggregate annual coal supply needs for 2014 through 2018, respectively.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe this portfolio of coal supplies represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL expect to meet remaining coal requirements from either future term contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Alliant Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters into various coal transportation agreements to meet IPL’s and WPL’s coal supply requirements.  As of December 31, 2013, existing coal transportation agreements cover approximately 100% and 14% of IPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2014 and 2015, respectively, and 100% and 31% of WPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2014 and 2015, respectively.Nearly all of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply targets of 25 to 55 days for EGUs with year-round deliveries and 30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for EGUs with seasonal deliveries.  Actual inventory averages for 2013 were 42 days for EGUs with year-round deliveries and 106 days for EGUs with seasonal deliveries.  The average days on hand were computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by estimated average daily tons burned.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically test coal from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which alternative sources of coal are most compatible with their EGUs.  Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to provide Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL with further protection against interruptions and lessen their dependence on their primary coal source.Average delivered fossil fuel costs are expected to increase in the future due to price structures and adjustment provisions in existing coal contracts, rate structures and adjustment provisions in existing transportation contracts, expiration of legacy transportation contracts, fuel-related surcharges incorporated by transportation carriers and expected future coal and transportation market trends.  Existing coal commodity contracts with terms of greater than one year have fixed future year prices that generally reflect recent market trends.  Rate adjustment provisions in older transportation contracts are primarily based on changes in the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor as published by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.  Rate adjustment provisions in more recent transportation contracts are based on changes in the All Inclusive Index Less Fuel as 13Table of Contentspublished by the Association of American Railroads.  These more recent transportation contracts also contain fuel surcharges that are subject to change monthly based on changes in diesel fuel prices.  Other factors that may impact coal prices for future commitments are increasing costs for supplier mineral rights, increasing costs to mine the coal, and changes in various associated laws and regulations.  For example, emission restrictions related to SO2, NOx and mercury, along with other environmental limitations on EGUs, continue to increase and will likely limit the ability to obtain, and further increase the cost of, adequate coal supplies.  Factors that may impact future transportation rates include, but are not limited to: the need for railroads to enhance and expand infrastructure, corresponding investments in locomotives and crews, and the desire to improve margins on coal movements commensurate with margins on non-coal movements.Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms.  Alliant Energy’s coal procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier diversity.  Similarly, given the term lengths of their transportation agreements and strategic alignment of agreement expirations for negotiation purposes, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.Natural Gas - Alliant Energy owns several larger natural gas-fired EGUs, including IPL’s Emery (603 MW), WPL’s Neenah (371 MW), WPL’s Riverside (675 MW) and Resources’ Sheboygan Falls (347 MW) facilities.  WPL has exclusive rights to the output of Sheboygan Falls under an affiliated lease agreement.  IPL and WPL also own several smaller natural gas-fired EGUs currently and expect to convert some EGUs currently fueled with coal to natural gas in the future.  These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands and when natural gas prices are low enough to make natural gas-fired generation economical compared to other fuel sources.  Internally generated electric supply from natural gas-fired EGUs represented approximately 5% to 10% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2013.  Alliant Energy manages the gas supply to these gas-fired EGUs and provides supply through a combination of third-party deliveries and pipeline transportation and storage contracts held by IPL and WPL.Wind - IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa began generating electricity in 2009.  WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began generating electricity in 2008.  WPL’s 201 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota began full generation of electricity in 2011.  Internally generated electric supply from wind facilities represented approximately 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2013.  All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be used in future years to comply with RES or other regulatory requirements, or sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities.Purchased Power - IPL and WPL periodically enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for electricity.  Purchased power represented approximately 30% to 50% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2013.  IPL’s most significant PPA is for the purchase of 431 MWs of capacity and the resulting energy from DAEC for a term from February 22, 2014 through December 31, 2025.  WPL’s most significant PPA is for the purchase of 150 MWs of energy for a term from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.Refer to Note 1(g) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of fuel-related costs and Note 16(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments in the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”Electric Transmission -IPL - IPL currently receives substantially all its electric transmission services from ITC.  ITC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  The annual transmission service rates that ITC charges its customers is calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.”  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ITC.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of a transmission cost rider approved by the IUB in January 2011 for recovery of IPL’s electric transmission service expenses.WPL - WPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ATC.  ATC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  The annual transmission service rates that ATC charges its customers are calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.”14Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2013, WPL, through its ownership interest in WPL Transco, held a 16% ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $272 million.  WPL’s investment in ATC generated equity income of $43 million in 2013 for Alliant Energy and WPL.  During 2013, ATC distributed to WPL, through WPL’s ownership interest in WPL Transco, $34 million in the form of dividends, or approximately 80% of WPL’s equity earnings from ATC.  Although no assurance can be given, Alliant Energy and WPL anticipate ATC will continue a dividend payout ratio close to this level in the future.In January 2014, WPL Transco’s operating agreement was amended to allow ATI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Resources, to become a member of WPL Transco in addition to WPL.  Beginning in 2014, WPL Transco’s capital contributions to ATC are expected to be funded from ATI instead of WPL.  As a result of ATI funding these capital contributions to ATC, WPL’s ownership interest in ATC, through its ownership interest in WPL Transco, is expected to decrease over time and ATI’s ownership interest in ATC, through its ownership interest in WPL Transco, is expected to increase.  ATC’s future dividends distributed to WPL and ATI will be based on their respective ownership interest in WPL Transco at the time of the dividend payment.Alliant Energy currently anticipates that ATI will fund capital contributions of approximately $10 million, $10 million and $15 million to ATC in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, to help fund future proposed transmission projects.  These future proposed transmission projects require approval from various regulatory agencies to construct.  Certain of these future proposed transmission projects are currently being challenged by other utilities and other transmission-only companies who have requested to own a portion of the future transmission projects proposed by ATC.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine the impact these challenges may have on ATC’s plans to construct these proposed transmission projects and the resulting impact on ATI’s future capital contributions to ATC and WPL’s and ATI’s equity earnings income and dividends received from ATC.In 2011, Duke Energy Corporation and ATC announced the creation of DATC, a joint venture that is expected to build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America.  In 2011, DATC announced its first set of transmission projects, which include seven new transmission lines in five Midwestern states to be constructed over a 10-year period for an aggregate cost of approximately $4 billion.  These transmission projects are subject to approval by various regulatory agencies.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine what impacts the joint venture and transmission line projects noted above, if constructed, will have on their future equity income, distributions from ATC, capital contributions to ATC, or ownership in ATC.Refer to Note 18 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of agreements between ATC and WPL.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for discussion of potential changes to ATC’s return on equity and regulatory capital structure for common equity, which could result in Alliant Energy and WPL realizing lower equity income and dividends from ATC in the future.MISO Markets - IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, which is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories.  IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are discussed in more detail below.  Corporate Services acts as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL pursuant to service agreements.  As agent, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission sale and purchase transactions within the markets operated by MISO and PJM.  Corporate Services assigns such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on statements received from MISO and PJM.  Refer to Note 18 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of these assigned amounts.Wholesale Energy Market - IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO.  The market dictates the process by which IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load.  In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy.  MISO evaluates IPL’s, WPL’s and other market participants’ offers, bids and energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders about where generation or transmission system expansion is needed.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated based on economic needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for their variable costs.  IPL and WPL may also periodically engage in related transactions in PJM’s bid/offer-based wholesale energy market, which are accounted for in a similar manner as the MISO transactions.15Table of ContentsAncillary Services Market - IPL and WPL also participate in MISO’s ancillary services market.  The ancillary services market integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market.  Regulation reserves refer to generation available to meet the moment-to-moment changes in generation that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand.  Contingency reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either on-line or that can be brought on-line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major events such as the loss of a large EGU or transmission line.Financial Transmission Rights and Auction Revenue Rights - In areas of constrained transmission capacity, costs could be higher due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  FTRs provide a hedge for congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market.  MISO allocates ARRs to IPL and WPL each year based on historical use of the transmission system.  The revenue rights associated with the allocated ARRs are used by IPL and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by MISO.  MISO allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31.  IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through May 31, 2014.Multi-value Projects - MISO tariffs billed to IPL and WPL include costs related to various shared transmission projects, including MVPs.  MVPs include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates, reduce market congestion or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within MISO.  MVP costs are socialized across the entire MISO footprint based on energy usage of each MISO participant.  The MISO transmission charges billed to IPL and WPL are expected to increase in the future due to the increased number of shared transmission projects occurring in the MISO region.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for further discussion of MISO transmission charges billed to IPL and WPL.Attachment Y Notices and System Support Resources - MISO requires its market participants (including IPL and WPL, among others) who own EGUs to submit an Attachment Y Notice if they plan to retire an EGU or suspend operations of an EGU for a period longer than two months.  Upon receiving an Attachment Y Notice, MISO will conduct a study to determine whether all or a portion of the EGU’s capacity is necessary to maintain system reliability.  If the EGU’s capacity is determined to be necessary to maintain system reliability, MISO designates the EGU as an SSR.  When an EGU is required to continue to operate for system reliability, the market participant may enter into an SSR agreement and negotiate an annual revenue requirement with MISO.  The annual revenue requirement for the SSR is subject to FERC approval and is assigned to load serving entities that benefit from the continued operations of the EGU.  In April 2013, the PSCW issued an order allowing investor-owned Wisconsin utilities to defer SSR costs incurred through December 31, 2015.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to estimate the amount of aggregate SSR charges that may be assigned to IPL and WPL as load serving entities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are also currently unable to estimate the impacts of any potential SSR designations on EGUs they plan to retire.

Alliant Energy’s gas utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing gas service in Iowa and southern Minnesota, and WPL providing gas service in southern and central Wisconsin.  In September 2013, IPL signed a definitive agreement to sell its Minnesota natural gas distribution assets.  Refer to Note 3(a) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of this proposed sale.  Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas utility operations.Jurisdictions - Gas utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount PercentIPL:           Iowa$261.2 56% $216.6 55% $263.3 55%Minnesota12.7 3% 10.1 2% 13.0 3%Subtotal273.9 59% 226.7 57% 276.3 58%WPL:           Wisconsin190.9 41% 169.6 43% 200.4 42% $464.8 100% $396.3 100% $476.7 100%Customers - The number of gas customers and communities served at December 31, 2013 were as follows: Retail Transportation / Total Communities Customers Other Customers Customers ServedIPL234,563 365 234,928 243WPL182,647 246 182,893 238 417,210 611 417,821 481IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB, MPUC or PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in gas infrastructure and recovery of costs required to serve customers.  Commodity, storage and transportation costs incurred by IPL and WPL are recovered pursuant to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms.  In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs.  Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s recent retail gas rate cases.Seasonality - Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in underground storage fields and deliver it in the winter.Competition - Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third-parties.  It remains uncertain if, and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.Gas Supply - IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 70 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada.  The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through September 2016.  IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily market-based.In more recent years, natural gas prices have fallen to levels not seen in a decade.  Prices have fallen largely due to surging supply caused by shale gas production.  Given the tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates in the cost of gas sold, the decreased natural gas prices do not have a material impact on their respective gas margins.20Table of ContentsIn providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with NNG, ANR, NGPL and NBPL allow access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements with FCS provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory.  In 2013, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths): NNG ANR NGPL FCS NBPL TotalIPL191,669 43,180 76,673 15,000 4,085 330,607WPL76,056 167,467 — — — 243,523Refer to Note 1(g) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery mechanisms and Note 16(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments in the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”Gas Environmental Matters - Refer to Note 16(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Environmental Matters” in MDA for discussion of gas environmental matters.Alliant Energy CorporationGas Operating Information2013 2012 2011 2010 2009Operating Revenues (in millions):         Residential$262.5 $224.3 $269.7 $273.7 $290.8Commercial150.3 124.3 155.1 154.2 174.7Industrial21.1 16.7 24.5 27.3 30.7Retail subtotal433.9 365.3 449.3 455.2 496.2Transportation/other30.9 31.0 27.4 25.4 29.1Total$464.8 $396.3 $476.7 $480.6 $525.3Gas Sales (000s Dths):         Residential29,916 23,071 26,891 27,128 27,711Commercial21,892 17,115 19,271 18,691 20,725Industrial3,803 3,068 3,848 4,158 4,558Retail subtotal55,611 43,254 50,010 49,977 52,994Transportation/other60,261 57,532 52,210 50,408 54,518Total115,872 100,786 102,220 100,385 107,512Retail Customers at End of Period:         Residential370,895 368,708 367,497 366,261 365,597Commercial45,874 45,684 45,667 45,552 45,641Industrial441 456 496 549 571Total417,210 414,848 413,660 412,362 411,809Other Selected Gas Data:         Heating degree days (a):         Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IPL) (normal - 6,794)7,232 5,901 6,745 6,868 7,074Madison, Wisconsin (WPL) (normal - 7,089)7,627 5,964 6,992 6,798 7,356Revenue per Dth sold to retail customers$7.80 $8.45 $8.98 $9.11 $9.36Purchased gas costs per Dth sold to retail customers$4.90 $4.94 $5.88 $6.05 $6.47(a)Heating degree days are calculated using a simple average of the high and low temperatures each day compared to a 65 degree base.

Our operations are also governed by organizations such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc.  Operations impacted by these regulatory groups include: the rates charged to our customers; our ability to site and construct new generating facilities, such as the natural gas generating facility in Marshalltown, Iowa, any potential new generation investment in Wisconsin, and future wind projects to utilize our remaining available wind sites, and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; the installation of environmental emission controls equipment and the amount of costs for the construction and maintenance of such equipment that may be recovered from customers; our ability to decommission generating facilities and recover the costs incurred to decommission the facilities and the remaining carrying value of such facilities; the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources and reductions in energy usage by customers; our ability to purchase generating facilities and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; the rates paid to transmission operators and the amount of those costs, and how those costs are recovered from customers; our ability to enter into purchased power agreements, such as the purchased power agreement entered into with NextEra Energy, Inc., the amount of costs associated therewith, and how those costs are recovered from customers; energy capacity standards and what forms of energy are considered when determining whether we meet those standards; the allocation of expenditures by transmission companies on transmission network upgrades and our ability to recover costs associated therewith from customers; reliability; safety; the issuance of securities; accounting matters; and transactions between affiliates.  Failure to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities for any of these matters, failure to receive approvals in a timely manner, or receiving approvals with uneconomical conditions may adversely impact our ability to achieve our strategic plan, cause us to record an impairment of our assets, and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.These regulatory authorities are also empowered to impose financial penalties and other sanctions if we are found to have violated statutes and regulations governing utility operations.  While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations governing us, state or federal agencies may not agree and may find that we violated a law or 23Table of Contentsregulation.  Such a finding could cause fines or penalties or could require us to implement new compliance programs, which could increase our costs of compliance and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our utility financial condition is influenced by how regulatory authorities establish the rates we can charge our customers, our authorized rates of return and common equity levels, and the amount of deferred costs that may be recovered from customers.  Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to earn authorized rates of return depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or authorized rates of return on capital will be earned.  In future rate cases, IPL and WPL may not receive an adequate amount of rate relief, rates may be reduced, rate refunds may be required, rate adjustments may not be approved on a timely basis, costs may not be otherwise recovered through rates, future rates may be temporarily frozen (as is the case for WPL’s retail electric and gas base rates through 2014) and authorized rates of return on capital may be reduced.  As a result, we may experience adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a wide variety of regulations, including and in addition to those described above, which are constantly changing.  Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional costs or change business operations or our business plan, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility activities.  Takeover attempts by potential purchasers who might be willing to pay a premium for our stock are also limited by certain provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act and the delays and conditions that generally result from the requirement that regulatory authorities approve such a transaction.Large construction projects are subject to delays and cost increases that may not be recovered from customers - Our strategic plan includes installing environmental control equipment at our newer and more efficient coal-fired generating facilities, making other large-scale improvements to such generating facilities, and the construction of natural gas-fired generating facilities.  These large construction projects are subject to various risks that could cause costs to increase or cause delays in completion.  These risks include changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities, fuel or labor; shortages in materials, equipment and qualified labor; changes to the scope or timing of the projects; general contractors or subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts; the inability to agree to contract terms or disputes in contract terms; poor initial cost estimates; work stoppages; adverse weather conditions; the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; governmental actions; legal action; unforeseen engineering or technology issues; limited access to capital; and other adverse economic conditions.  If a construction project is not completed or is delayed, or final costs exceed the costs approved by our regulators, for example, if the Marshalltown Generating Station exceeds the cost cap approved by the IUB, we may not be able to recover all costs for the project in rates and face increased risk of potential impairment of our investment in the project.  Inability to recover costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which could be difficult and costly, and pursuant to which we could incur material liabilities - We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations.  We are also subject to a Consent Decree between WPL, the EPA and the Sierra Club, which resolved environmental claims related to WPL’s generating facilities.  The regulations and the Consent Decree govern air emissions, water quality, cooling water intake structures, wastewater discharges, the generation, transport and disposal of coal combustion products and other solid wastes and hazardous substances, and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals, which are subject to renewal proceedings and legal challenges.  Environmental laws, regulations and the Consent Decree can also require us to restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels, to install emission controls equipment at our facilities, clean up spills and correct environmental hazards and other contamination.  We may be required to pay all or a portion of the costs to remediate (i.e., clean-up) sites where our past activities, or the activities of certain other parties, caused environmental contamination, including sites of manufactured gas plants operated by our predecessors.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant down-times and can negatively affect the affordability of rates we charge our customers.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of any fines or penalties, including the severity of any restriction on our operations) necessary to comply with, or as a result of liabilities under, these environmental laws, regulations, and the Consent Decree, although we expect the expenditures to be material.24Table of ContentsAlthough we believe we comply in all material respects with currently applicable environmental laws, regulations, and the Consent Decree, we may receive notices of violation from state or federal agencies.  Citizen groups or private individuals that feel environmental regulations are not being sufficiently enforced by regulatory agencies may bring legal action against those regulatory agencies or bring citizen enforcement actions against us.  We may be subject to litigation over environmental issues, including claims for property damage or personal injury, or suits by citizen groups alleging violations of environmental requirements.  For example, the Consent Decree resulted from allegations originally raised by the Sierra Club that WPL violated various provisions of the Clean Air Act.  If we are unsuccessful defending or settling litigation from governmental agencies or citizen groups, we could be subject to restrictions or prohibitions on operating our generation facilities, costly upgrades to our generating facilities, payment of damages or fines, requirements to complete other beneficial environmental projects, and litigation costs, all of which could be material.  An adverse result in such legal actions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to existing and potential future governmental mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings.  These mandates are designed in part to mitigate the potential environmental impacts of utility operations.  Failure to meet the requirements of these mandates may result in fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to us.  These revised and new laws or regulations may include regulation of mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, particulates, coal ash and other coal combustion products, and cooling water intake structures.  Such changes could materially increase our cost of compliance.  Our strategic plan was developed in part to comply with certain expected environmental laws and regulations as we anticipate they will be finally adopted.  Revision of existing environmental laws or regulations may cause: (1) state utility commissions to not approve our plans to install environmental emission controls equipment at our existing generating facilities or not allow us to recover costs of such projects; (2) state utility commissions to not approve costs of emission allowances purchased to comply with environmental regulations that are no longer applicable to our operations; (3) co-owners in our jointly-owned facilities to not agree with our decision to move forward with these projects; or (4) our current plans do not meet new requirements.  These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Actions related to global climate change and reducing GHG emissions could negatively impact us - The primary GHG emitted from our utility operations is CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels at our generating facilities, which are primarily coal-fired facilities.  We could incur costs or other obligations to comply with any GHG regulations that are adopted in the future, and could become the target of legal claims or challenges, because generating electricity using fossil fuels emits CO2 and other GHGs.  In particular, President Obama and his administration have affirmed that the regulation of GHG emissions continues to be a top priority.  The EPA has issued proposed regulations governing GHG emissions from new generating facilities, which would impact the Marshalltown Generating Station and any new generation investment in Wisconsin.  The EPA is also expected to propose regulations in 2014 governing GHG emissions from existing generating facilities, which potentially could impact all of our generating facilities.  Due to the uncertainty of what form CO2 emissions regulations regarding our existing generating facilities could take and control technologies available to reduce GHG emissions, including CO2, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts any future regulations would have on our operations.  The impacts of such proposals could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Demand for energy may decrease - Our results of operations are affected by the demand for energy in our service territories.  We could lose customers, and therefore see lower demand for energy, due to economic conditions, customers constructing their own generation facilities, higher costs and rates charged to customers, or loss of service territory or franchises.  Further, the energy conservation and technological advances that increase energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for energy products.  In addition, state and/or federal regulations require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for energy.  We may also lose wholesale customers to competitors.  Technology improvements and regulatory developments are making distributed generation feasible for more of our customers.  As more customers utilize distributed generation, demand for energy from us may decline.  Future economic growth may not create enough growth for us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers.  The loss of customers, the inability to replace those customers with new customers, and the decrease in demand for energy could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Regional and national economic conditions could have an unfavorable impact on us - Our utility and non-regulated businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with.  25Table of ContentsAdverse economic conditions in our service territories reduce the demand for electricity and natural gas.  We lost certain customers after plants closed due to the 2009 recession.  Reduced volumes of electricity and natural gas sold, or the inability to collect unpaid bills from our customers from a deterioration in national or regional economic conditions, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by the impacts of weather - Our electric and gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance.  Demand for electricity is greater in the summer months associated with higher air conditioning needs.  In addition, market prices for electricity generally peak in the summer due to the higher demand.  Conversely, demand for natural gas depends significantly upon weather patterns in winter months due to heavy use in residential and commercial heating.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, we have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Thus, unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - We are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Generating, transmission and distribution facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets of physical attacks.  Physical attacks on transmission and distribution facilities, including a substation in San Jose, California and substation and transmission facilities in Arkansas, appeared to be terrorist-style attacks.  The risks posed by such attacks could include, among other things, the inability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources, the increased cost of security and insurance, the disruption of, volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, and a decline in the economy within our service territories, all of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the cost of repairing damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure due to acts of terrorism, and the loss of revenue if such events prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability - We operate in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and or/fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets.  FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to deter cyber attacks.  The safeguards we have may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber security.  We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.  If the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operation.We may not be able to fully recover costs related to commodity prices - The prices that we may obtain for electric energy may not compensate for changes in delivered coal, natural gas or electric energy spot-market costs, or changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of electric energy.  As a result, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers, especially at WPL where we do not have a retail electric automatic fuel cost adjustment clause, which would allow for more consistent and timely cost recovery.We are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because the majority of the electricity generated by us is from our coal-fired generating facilities.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply and transportation of coal for most of our existing generating capability, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Further, we currently rely on coal primarily from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region may cause us to incur additional 26Table of Contentscosts which may not be fully recovered through rates.  Increases in prices and costs due to disruptions that are not fully and timely recovered in rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to changes in the price and availability of natural gas.  In addition to supplying natural gas to our natural gas customers, we also have responsibility to supply natural gas to certain natural gas-fired electric generating facilities that we own.  This increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas, which have remained low recently, but have been volatile in the past.  We have natural gas supply contracts in place, which are generally short-term in duration.  The natural gas supply commitments are either fixed price in nature or market-based.  As some of the contracts are market-based, and all of the contracts are short-term, we may not be able to purchase natural gas with terms and prices as favorable as the current contracts.  Further, any disruption of production or transportation of natural gas, such as the recent pipeline explosion in Manitoba, Canada, may cause us to incur additional costs to purchase natural gas, which may not be fully recovered through rates and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to fully recover higher transmission costs related to changing transmission reliability requirements - Both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system that they do not own or control.  Rates charged to IPL and WPL for such transmission service are regulated by FERC.  FERC also regulates transmission owners’ operations in order to support the reliability of the transmission network.  Changes are occurring in the transmission network which are required to, among other things, accommodate renewable energy and the decommissioning of older coal-fired generating facilities.  These changes include socializing certain transmission network upgrades and system support resource payments, which may increase transmission costs to IPL and WPL.  The prices that IPL and WPL charge for electric energy may not totally compensate for the increase in such transmission costs.  We may be unable to fully pass on the increases in such transmission costs to our customers, especially at WPL where we do not have a retail automatic transmission rider.  In addition, if the transmission rider at IPL is amended or removed, we may not be able to recover IPL’s full transmission costs.  Inability to fully recover transmission costs in a timely manner may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on the capital markets and could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the capital markets - Successful implementation of our strategic plan and other long-term business strategies is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates.  We have forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $3.6 billion over the next four years.  Disruption, uncertainty or volatility in those markets could increase our cost of capital or limit the availability of capital.  Disruptions could be caused by Federal Reserve policies and actions including tapering of its quantitative easing program, U.S. debt management concerns, U.S. debt limit and budget debates including government shutdowns, European sovereign debt concerns, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, a negative view of the utility industry or our company, failures of financial institutions or other factors.  Any disruptions could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategic plan.We rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit markets.  If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, we could pay higher interest rates in future financings, the pool of potential lenders could be reduced, borrowing costs under existing credit facilities could increase, our access to the commercial paper market could be limited, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties.  If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.We are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses - We are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, and the availability of, and our ability to recruit, qualified personnel, which could affect our businesses and our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, our workforce includes a significant number of employees who are nearing retirement.  We need employees with specialized and technical skills in order to achieve our strategic plan.  It may be difficult to retain current employees with these specialized skills, especially as they near retirement, and it may be difficult to find new employees with the necessary skills.  We are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with approximately 2,300 employees.  Our contract with one collective bargaining unit representing over 1,000 of our employees is due to expire in May 2014.  Any work stoppage experienced in connections with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to implement our strategic plan.We face risks associated with operating electric and natural gas infrastructure - The operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, the dependence on a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output 27Table of Contentsor efficiency, operator error and compliance with mandatory reliability standards.  The operation of our energy delivery infrastructure involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment and forest or prairie fires developing from vegetation around our power lines.  In addition, the North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an extensive power outage in our delivery systems.  Further, the transmission system in our utilities’ service territories is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within our service territories.  The transmission constraints could result in an inability to deliver energy from generating facilities, particularly wind generating facilities, to the national grid, or to access lower cost sources of electric energy.  We also have obligations to provide electrical service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The operation of our natural gas distribution activities also involves many risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses.  These risks could result in loss of human life, particularly in highly populated areas, significant damage to property, environmental emissions, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  We are also responsible for compliance with new and changing mandatory reliability and safety standards.  Failure to meet these standards could result in substantial fines.  We also have obligations to provide service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Storms or other natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - Storms and other natural disasters, including events such as floods, tornadoes, blizzards, ice storms, or droughts may adversely impact our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources.  In addition, we could incur large costs to repair damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure, or costs related to environmental remediation, due to storms or natural disasters.  The restoration costs may not be fully covered by insurance policies.  Damage to assets could also require us to take impairments, such as occurred with our damaged Sixth Street Generating Station after a flood.  Some costs may not be recovered in rates, or there could be significant delays in cost recovery.  Storms and natural disasters may prevent our customers from being able to operate or may significantly slow growth or cause a decline in the economy within our service territories.  The reduced demand for energy could cause lower sales and revenues, which may not be replaced or recovered in rates.  Any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may incur material post-closing adjustments related to past asset and business divestitures - We recently sold RMT, Inc. (RMT), a non-regulated subsidiary.  Pursuant to the terms of that sale, we may face unfavorable post-closing adjustments that could be material.  In addition, we might be required to make payments on liabilities that we retained pursuant to the terms of the sale.  In addition, Alliant Energy continues to guarantee RMT’s performance obligations related to certain of RMT’s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy’s sale of RMT.  Required material post-closing adjustments or payments on retained liabilities or guarantees with respect to RMT or other future asset or business divestitures, such as the proposed sales of our Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We face risks related to non-regulated operations - We rely on our non-regulated operations for a portion of our earnings.  If our non-regulated investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings.  In particular, Franklin County Wind LLC is a non-regulated subsidiary that operates a non-regulated 99 MW wind project in Franklin County, Iowa, referred to as the Franklin County wind project.  The Franklin County wind project does not currently have a buyer of its electrical output and its electrical output is being sold into the general market at prevailing market prices.  Failure to find a buyer for the output, or selling the output at disadvantageous market prices, may cause the project to lose money or cause an impairment of its assets.  Such losses or impairments could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, a variety of operating parameters, including adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends - Alliant Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own.  Accordingly, the primary sources of funds for Alliant Energy to pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, primarily its utility subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on Alliant Energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations and the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries.  Our utilities each have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of any outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations applicable to them.  If we do not receive adequate dividends and distributions from 28Table of Contentsour subsidiaries, then we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on Alliant Energy common stock.Changes to certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations - We have significantly reduced our federal and state income tax obligations for the past few years through tax planning strategies.  These tax planning strategies have generated large annual taxable losses and tax credits over the past few years that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses and federal tax credit carryforwards.  We plan to utilize these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our income tax obligations.  If we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before they expire, we may incur material charges to earnings.  If the IRS does not agree with the deductions resulting from our tax planning strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Our utility business currently operates wind generating facilities, which generate material production tax credits for us to use to reduce our federal tax obligations.  The amount of production tax credits we earn is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by our wind projects and the applicable tax credit rate.  A variety of operating and economic parameters, including significant transmission constraints, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by our wind projects resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have tax benefit riders in place in Iowa that provide billing credits to our customers.  We have made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the tax benefit riders for accounting purposes.  If those assumptions are not accurate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.Lastly, if corporate tax rates or policies are changed in future federal or state legislation, we may be required to take material charges against earnings.Poor performance of pension and other postretirement plan investments could negatively impact our financial condition - We have pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to a large portion of our employees and retirees.  Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans.  The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics.  Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of our pension plans at various times in the past.  Future losses of asset values may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements.  Downward pressure on the asset values of our pension plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Energy industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses - We operate in a highly regulated business environment.  The advent of new and unregulated markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.  The evolution of the wholesale and transmission markets has the potential to significantly increase costs of transmission, costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, costs of participation in the new markets and costs stemming from estimated payment settlements.  Competitive pressures, including advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in our utilities losing market share and customers and incurring stranded costs (i.e., assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable through customer rates as a result of competitive pricing), which would be borne by our shareowners.  Increased competition from any restructuring efforts in our primary retail electric service territories may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.ITEM 1B
