BUSINESSFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of software and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our software directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We also distribute our products through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators, independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. We offer some of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model (also known as a hosted model or “cloud-based” model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. Our software runs on personal computers (“PCs”) and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product.  We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia. Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. We maintain executive offices and principal facilities at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000. We maintain a website at www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from this site free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov.BUSINESS OVERVIEW For more than 29 years, innovation in Adobe software and technologies has transformed how individuals, businesses and governments communicate and interact with their constituents. Across the markets and customers we serve, Adobe helps its customers create and deliver the most compelling content and web applications in a streamlined workflow, and optimize those experiences and marketing activities for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into compelling and valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anywhere, anytime.While we continue to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions, we are focusing our greatest business investment in two strategic growth areas:Digital Media—providing tools and solutions that enable individuals, small businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 20 years, but we are evolving rapidly to provide these customers with more complete and integrated workflow to handle the plethora of new devices, formats and business models that are emerging. Digital Marketing—providing solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers. We process over a trillion web transactions a quarter via SaaS, helping our customers with analytics and reporting, multi-channel campaign execution, delivering personalized web experiences and media monetization. This complements our digital media franchise, bringing together the art of creating content with the science of measuring and optimizing it, enabling our customers to achieve optimal business outcomes.3Table of ContentsTo capitalize on the potential in these two market areas, we made several significant changes in key areas of our business during the past year.  We have made investments to increase the deployment of some of our products through new SaaS models, and to augment how we license our software to include a new subscription model for our creative products. We believe these business model changes will allow us to target new users, as well as increase the amount of recurring revenue we generate as a percent of our total revenue—creating the potential for our business to be more predictable.We have also invested in the development of new products that address emerging customer needs in these two market areas and represent new revenue sources. In addition, we made several acquisitions during the past year to broaden the scope of our solutions. We believe the new products we are bringing to market, combined with products and technologies we have acquired, will make our Digital Media and Digital Marketing solutions more compelling to our customers.While we have increased our investments in some products areas, we have similarly reduced our focus on some of our products at the same time. The resulting saved costs from the reduced focus in some product areas is being redeployed as investments into research and development, and into sales and marketing to drive higher growth potential in our two market focus areas.Because of this transformation we have undertaken, as we enter fiscal year 2012 we believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in the emerging Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories where our mission to change the world through digital experiences resonates well with customers.PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVERVIEWEntering fiscal 2011, we organized our products and services into the following businesses: Creative and Interactive Solutions, Digital Media Solutions, Digital Enterprise Solutions, Omniture, and Print and Publishing. We reported our financial results based on these named businesses, with the exception of Digital Enterprise Solutions which we reported in two segments: Knowledge Worker and Enterprise.Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we modified our segments due to changes we made in how we operate our business. We have combined our prior Creative and Interactive Solutions segment with our Digital Media Solutions segment and our Knowledge Worker segment, and named it Digital Media. We also renamed our Omniture segment to Digital Marketing and combined it with our prior Enterprise segment. These changes reflect our focus on the two strategic growth opportunities outlined above. Our Print and Publishing segment, which contains many of our more mature products and solutions, continues to be reported as it was in fiscal 2011.Accordingly, our three fiscal 2012 reportable segments will be Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print and Publishing. We will adjust our reportable segments at the beginning of fiscal 2012 to reflect these changes. The following overview begins with a discussion of our results organized by our fiscal 2011 reportable segments. It follows with an explanation of our market opportunities and a discussion of our strategies to address our market opportunities in fiscal 2012 and beyond, organized by our new fiscal 2012 reportable segments.Fiscal 2011 Business Segments ResultsCreative and Interactive Solutions Fiscal 2011 Business SummaryOur Creative Suite 5 (“CS5”) family of products, which first shipped in fiscal 2010, incorporates Adobe technologies used by creative professionals into five Creative Suite editions and thirteen individual creative products, providing tools for the various creative disciplines our customers desire. Entering fiscal 2011, the adoption of CS5 was greater than that of its predecessor, Creative Suite 4 (“CS4”), due to its new feature set as well as an improvement in the general macro-economic environment. This caused overall revenue for CS5 to be stronger than revenue achieved with CS4 for a comparable period of time since their respective release dates.In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we delivered Creative Suite 5.5 (“CS5.5”), the newest release of our creative toolset. This release marked the start of a plan to deliver annual releases for our Creative Suite family of products to address the needs of our customers on a more timely basis than our prior release cadence of eighteen to twenty months. CS5.5 provided numerous feature enhancements, particularly in the areas of digital publishing for tablets, mobile content creation, website creation with new HTML version 5 (“HTML5”) capabilities, and advanced video content creation capabilities.The launch of CS5.5 also included the introduction of a new subscription offering to attract more price-sensitive customers to license Creative Suite products. We believe the subscription option is valued by customers who seek the flexibility and affordability of monthly payments. Adoption of the new CS5.5 subscription offering indicated it attracted new customers to the product, many of whom would otherwise not have licensed it, as well as enticed existing users of older versions of the product to upgrade to the latest version.4Table of ContentsBased on the success of CS5.5, as of the end of fiscal 2011 we experienced an increase in combined revenue for CS5 and CS5.5 when compared to similar periods of availability for CS4 and its predecessor Creative Suite 3 (“CS3”). In addition, CS5.5 maintained the strong run-rate of the Creative Suite business that was established by CS5, achieving one of the goals of moving to annual releases with the product family. Adoption of CS5 and CS5.5 in the education market was also strong during the year, resulting in record education revenue and contributing to the success of these releases.Revenue derived from licensing of our Creative Suite editions equated to approximately 70% of the total revenue generated with the Creative Suite family of products. Licensing of individual Creative and Interactive products such as Dreamweaver, Flash Professional, Illustrator and InDesign also contributed to the success of CS5.5 in fiscal 2011.In the fall of 2010 we introduced a beta of the Adobe Digital Publishing solution, an online, hosted publishing solution that works with InDesign and enables magazine and newspaper publishers to deliver engaging, branded reading experiences of their publications to mobile and tablet devices. In the Spring of 2011, we delivered an update to our Digital Publishing solution and made it generally available to all enterprise customers. Our Digital Publishing solution combines hosted services, flexible e-commerce models to sell single issues and subscriptions directly to consumers through mobile marketplaces, and analytics capabilities based on our Adobe Digital Marketing Suite. Content is created and enhanced through integration with CS5.5 to enable a complete workflow for the creation and delivery of content to mobile device users via our Content Viewer technology. As of the end of fiscal 2011, more than 1,200 published titles have been delivered to online app stores and newsstands, reflecting the success and strong adoption of Digital Publishing solution by our publishing customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we also delivered Digital Publishing Single Edition, which can be used by customers that want to publish their content as apps in app stores on an individual and ad hoc basis.To help our customers create new content leveraging advancements in web standards, in the spring of 2011 we introduced a beta release of Adobe Edge, which is a new web motion and interaction design tool that allows designers to bring animated content to websites, using web standards like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3. We also delivered a beta release of Adobe Muse, which allows web designers to design and publish HTML websites without writing HTML code. Combined, more than 500,000 downloads of these pre-release tools occurred in fiscal 2011, indicating a strong desire of our customers to utilize these solutions and their capabilities.At our Adobe MAX user conference in October 2011, we announced Adobe Creative Cloud, which is a comprehensive offering of creative services, Creative Suite desktop applications, new content creation touch-based apps for use on tablets, and community features that together, we believe, will redefine the content creation process. The full offering, marketed through a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, is expected to be available in 2012 and is discussed later in the "Digital Media Market Opportunities and Strategies" section.During fiscal 2011, we advanced the capabilities of our Adobe Flash Player with the release of Flash Player 11. Flash Player is a cross-platform, browser-based application runtime that provides viewing of expressive applications, content, and videos across most browsers and operating systems. New features in version 11 include 3D accelerated graphic support, native 64-bit operating system support, improved software encoding for cameras and protected HTTP dynamic streaming.Adoption of Flash Player during the year remained strong on PC platforms as well as non-PC platforms where it is supported. Due to the frequent downloads of our client technologies such as Flash Player, we generate revenue through OEM relationships with companies where we include their technologies as part of the download offerings of our client technologies on PCs. In fiscal 2011, this download revenue grew when compared to fiscal 2010.In fiscal 2011, we also broadened the reach of our cross-platform client technology named Adobe AIR. The AIR runtime enables developers to deploy standalone applications built with HTML, JavaScript, ActionScript, Flex, Flash Professional, and Flash Builder across platforms and devices - including Android, BlackBerry, iOS devices, personal computers, and televisions.There have been approximately 500 million AIR downloads on PCs, with more than 12,000 apps built using AIR that are available on app stores such as Android Marketplace, Apple App Store, Blackberry App World and Amazon Appstore. In October, we extended the capabilities of AIR to mobile devices with the delivery of AIR version 3. AIR 3 enables 3D accelerated graphics rendering, native extensions for developers to utilize platform-specific features as part of their AIR code, and other platform-specific development features.In the online video and rich media delivery market, we continued innovating to maintain and grow our market leadership position. During the year we achieved strong adoption of Adobe Flash Media Server (“FMS”) version 4.5 which now delivers media to multiple platforms including Apple iOS devices via RTMP and HTTP methods. Based on this adoption, we achieved strong year-over-year revenue for our family of media server products in fiscal 2011.5Table of ContentsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced the acquisitions of TypeKit, for making expressive type available anywhere on the web, and Nitobi, the maker of PhoneGap. Nitobi is the creator and primary contributor to the open source PhoneGap framework, which allows developers to create device native mobile applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Both TypeKit and PhoneGap are planned to be integral parts of our Creative Cloud offering in fiscal 2012, which is discussed later in this section.Digital Media Solutions Fiscal 2011Business SummaryEntering fiscal 2011, our Digital Media Solutions business, like our Creative and Interactive Solutions business, benefited from the strength of the CS5 release that occurred in fiscal 2010. In May of 2011, as noted earlier, we delivered CS5.5, the newest release of our creative toolset which included new versions of our video authoring products. Adoption of the new CS5.5 products in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011, as well as ongoing adoption of our imaging products helped to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our Digital Media Solutions segment during the entire fiscal year.Throughout fiscal 2011, we maintained our focus on making Photoshop the standard by which all other imaging products are measured. As an essential tool in most creative customer's workflow, many of our customers acquire its capabilities through the purchase of suites of our products, the management of which was handled by our Creative and Interactive Solutions business.With our Photoshop family of products, including Photoshop Extended, Photoshop, and Photoshop Lightroom, we experienced year-over-year revenue growth during fiscal 2011. The new release of Lightroom version 3, used by professional and amateur photographers to manage, enhance and share their photographs, achieved strong adoption in its targeted market.Similarly, our video authoring tools—including Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Adobe Audition, and the suite containing them called Creative Suite Production Premium—achieved strong market share and revenue growth during the year due to new CS5.5 versions of the products and strong execution by our sales and marketing teams to position Adobe as a leader in the overall digital video solutions category.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we released version 10 of our Adobe Photoshop Elements software which is our digital imaging application targeted for amateur photographers and digital imaging hobbyists. In the same quarter, we released version 10 of Adobe Premiere Elements software which is our video editing software that can be used by hobbyists to enhance and share their digital video memories on DVDs. We also released a software bundle that includes the new versions of  Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements to target hobbyists who desire both applications in one affordable package. Adoption of these new releases helped to drive year-over-year revenue growth in this category during the fiscal year.To capitalize on the increased use of smartphones and tablets, we released versions of applications which run on mobile devices, including Photoshop Express, which is a popular application and available for free on devices running Google Android OS and Apple iOS; Adobe Revel (formerly Adobe Carousel), which gives users access to their entire photo library from their Apple devices along with photo-processing features based on Lightroom; and Photoshop Touch—our newest tablet application leveraging the brand and capabilities of our popular Photoshop imaging franchise, which was made available for a fee on Android-based devices in the fall of 2011 and is expected to be released for Apple iOS-based devices in 2012.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we announced our acquisition of Auditude, a video ad serving platform that increases the capabilities of our video product solution to enable our customers to deliver and monetize their media to PC, mobile, tablet and TV-screens that are connected to the internet. We believe the addition of Auditude strengthens our offering to help customers monetize their media assets on the web.Knowledge Worker Fiscal 2011 Business SummaryIn fiscal 2011, our Knowledge Worker revenue increased when compared to fiscal 2010 due to strong adoption of our Acrobat X release that launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Helping to drive this performance was the success of our corporate and volume licensing programs, which allow customers who want to deploy Acrobat to many users to do so through convenient license acquisition and installation means. In addition, an increase in pricing resulted in an increase in the average selling price (“ASP”) of Acrobat during the year and helped to drive the revenue growth achieved.Acrobat X, the tenth major version of our Acrobat family of products, contains new and improved features that improve user productivity, streamline document reviews, collect data in fillable PDF forms, protect PDF documents and other content, and share PDF documents with others. The product also extends the value proposition for knowledge workers to communicate and collaborate more effectively. During the year, we further extended the value of PDF to mobile devices with the release of native Adobe Reader applications for Android and iOS. We also increased our focus on security to guard against malicious use of PDFs and Adobe Reader. This focus included the regular release of product updates to address new security threats that were identified throughout the year, and also increased awareness by our customers to stay more current with the latest release of our products.6Table of ContentsDuring the year, continued adoption of our Creative Suite products has also contributed to broader adoption of Acrobat in the creative professional market. Acrobat Pro is included in four of the five Creative Suite editions and utilization of Acrobat prepress, printing and collaboration functionality is a critical component of creative customer workflows. As such, adoption of Acrobat through the Creative Suite family of products has resulted in a material amount of Acrobat revenue being reported in our Creative Solutions Segment during the year.In the summer of 2011, we announced the acquisition of EchoSign, a provider of on-demand, web-based, electronic signature solutions. The addition of EchoSign, combined with the release of our Adobe FormsCentral solution and Export PDF, enables us to increase the value of document exchange services that we offer to our knowledge worker customers and thus increase the potential addressable market for our knowledge worker offerings.Enterprise Fiscal 2011 Business SummaryIn fiscal 2011, we achieved strong year-over-year revenue growth in our Enterprise business. This performance was driven primarily by the addition and increased adoption of our CQ5 Web Experience Management (“WEM”) solution, which we acquired with our acquisition of Day Software Holding AG ("Day") in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Our market-leading WEM solution combines web content management, digital asset management and social collaboration offerings, and enabled our sales force to target organizations that need to transform their websites by enabling them to create, manage, distribute, and monetize content while optimizing the web, mobile, and social collaboration experience for their customers.Adoption of our Adobe LiveCycle and Adobe Connect products slowed during the year when compared to prior years as we increasingly shifted our focus to marketing the benefits of our WEM solution to targeted enterprise customers. In November  2011, we announced a realignment of our business priorities which resulted in an increased focus on the Digital Media and Digital Marketing  opportunities as we entered fiscal 2012. The core of our digital marketing offering is the combination of our Omniture and Day product lines, and with this business shift, we announced we are focusing our future go-to-market efforts for LiveCycle and Connect on government and financial services markets while scaling back significantly on other targeted markets. For Connect, we will continue to aggressively leverage and sell through our go-to-market partners.Omniture Fiscal 2011 Business SummaryOur Omniture product family processes over one trillion transactions per quarter in a hosted environment for thousands of customers around the world. As we have broadened our investment and go-to-market capabilities with our Omniture products, we have increased our bookings and revenue while maintaining high customer retention rates for our enterprise customers. In fiscal 2011, Omniture revenue grew when compared to fiscal 2010.Our flagship Omniture product, Adobe SiteCatalyst, anchors our analytics business and represented approximately 50% of Omniture revenue reported for fiscal 2011. The percentage of revenue beyond analytics represented by additional types of services which are part of our Digital Marketing Suite has been increasing.  Revenue from these additional services, which include Test&Target, Scene7 and new services such as Adobe SocialAnalytics that was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, and the acquisition of Demdex for data management, grew steadily in fiscal 2011, resulting in larger engagements and transactions with our customers. As a result, we increased the number of customers that spend more than $500,000 on an annual basis by more than 25% as compared to fiscal 2010.In March 2011, we began to integrate our Omniture products with our newly acquired Day offering for WEM. Customer interest in a combined offering of Omniture plus Day increased throughout the year, resulting in our decision to substantially grow our investment in the digital marketing market area. As previously discussed, our unique value proposition and successful customer proof points during the year with this combined offering resulted in our decision to focus on the large digital marketing opportunity. This is further discussed in the "Digital Marketing Opportunity" section.Print and Publishing Fiscal 2011 Business SummaryIn fiscal 2011, we maintained  a consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and license in our Print and Publishing business. During the year we delivered version 3 of our Technical Communication Suite, which is a set of tools for technical publishing, and version 2.5 of our  eLearning Suite, which is a complete set of tools for creating professional eLearning courseware. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and we believe our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry. We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow 7Table of Contentssoftware, printers and other output devices, and in fiscal 2011, we maintained our OEM PostScript revenue through continued innovation with PostScript technologies.Fiscal 2012 Business Segment Market Opportunities and StrategiesDigital Media SegmentDigital Media Market Opportunities and StrategiesWe believe we are at a key inflection point in the history of the internet. Convergence of major trends is occurring which is driving changes in consumer behavior and expectations. These trends include the rise in use of smartphones and tablets, increased internet access speeds, new business models driven by online commerce and app stores, the increase in media and entertainment made available online, the impact of social online communication, and software delivery transitioning from prior PC delivery models to cloud-based services. These trends and changes are having a profound impact on our customers. Adobe customers—large and small—are rethinking its online presence, addressing concerns such as how to make its site more dynamic, how to manage visitors from both PC and non-PC devices, whether to invest in web browser-based applications or create individual mobile apps, and how to transition from legacy content delivery methods to new models which present new revenue streams. For our customers, these challenges create a great deal of complexity in their workflows and cost structures. For Adobe, these challenges and the complexity our customers face are growing the size of the markets we can target. In fiscal 2012 with our newly named Digital Media business, we believe these market conditions present significant opportunities for Adobe to rapidly deliver product innovation, access new market segments, increase engagement with our customers, transition our business to more of a recurring revenue model, and accelerate our revenue growth. Our goal is to be the leading provider of tools and services that allow individuals, small businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their content anywhere.The flagship of our Digital Media business is our Creative Suite family of products. Consisting of thirteen individual products and five suites that contain different configurations of these products, we focus on the needs of creative professional customers, which include graphic designers, production artists, web designers and developers, user interface designers, writers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game developers, mobile application developers, students and administrators. They use and rely on our solutions for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and, document creation and collaboration.  They work in businesses ranging from large publishers,  media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and individual freelancers.Our Creative Suite family of products is used by creative professionals to create much of the printed and on-line information people see, read and interact with every day, including newspapers, magazines, websites, mobile apps, catalogs, advertisements, brochures, product documentation, books, memos, reports and banners. Our tools are also used to create and enhance visually rich content, including video, animation and mobile content, that is created by multimedia, film, television, audio and video producers who work in advertising, web design, music, entertainment, corporate and marketing communications, product design, user interface design, sales training, printing, architecture and fine arts. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and high end consumers also use our creative products to create and deliver content that is of creative professional quality.We believe the innovation we deliver in the tools and solutions our customers use enables the future of digital media. Our creative solutions are mission-critical to customers such as publishers, advertisers and media companies; they rely on Adobe tools and technologies to create highly compelling content, deliver it across diverse media and devices, and then optimize it through systematic targeting and measurement. For example:•Publishers around the world are striving to embrace the digital age to build distinctive brands, develop sustainable business strategies, achieve greater profitability, and deliver optimized content to fragmented audiences on an expanding array of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other devices. Their audiences seek compelling, media-rich experiences, wherever they go, using their preferred devices.•Advertisers face an ever-shifting media landscape. Traditional media are giving way to the emergence of new digital channels such as mobile devices and social networks. Customers have greater choice in where they go for their preferred brands, making it harder to keep audiences engaged. Successful advertising increasingly requires compelling content and greater focus on data and analytics than ever before in order to optimize advertising for improved targeting and higher returns.8Table of Contents•Media companies also face a shifting landscape as traditional media delivery evolves into multiple channels for media companies to deliver and monetize their content. As more premium video content and entertainment is delivered over the internet to PC, smartphone and tablet screens, as well as internet-connected TVs, media companies are looking to create new revenue streams through subscription services and ad-based revenue models to supplement their historical forms of revenue.The challenges facing customers such as these not only exist in how they create and deliver their content, but also in how they manage, measure and optimize their content. Adobe's value proposition extends beyond our historical focus on content creation to other critical aspects of our customers' workflow, with how we can integrate the capabilities of our analytics and web optimization solutions, as well as our WEM solution. These are discussed later in the "Digital Marketing Opportunity" section.Historically, we delivered new releases of our Creative Suite tools every eighteen to twenty months. With the release of CS5.5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we moved to an annual release cycle for our products. This change in product release cadence enabled us to deliver more frequent innovation to our customers to address their challenges. It also enabled Adobe to offer a new monthly subscription offering, with the expectation of  more frequent updates to key applications our customers use. The lower monthly fee, as opposed to the higher upfront perpetual license fee required to license our software, enables cost-sensitive new users to acquire the product, as well as users of older versions of the product to migrate to the latest version at a lower upfront cost. The subscription offering also enables users to have immediate access to software updates and new innovations that we implement in our creative products in between annual release dates of the products.Given our success in attracting new users to our initial subscription offering, combined with how cloud-based services are increasing as a means to deliver more value to software users, we announced in October 2011 a major new offering to deploy and license our creative tools moving forward. At our Adobe MAX user conference we introduced Creative Cloud, which is a comprehensive offering of our Creative Suite desktop applications combined with creative services, new content creation touch-based apps for use on tablets, and community features that together we believe will redefine the content creation process.Creative services offerings anticipated to be included in our Creative Cloud offering include integrated publishing services like Business Catalyst for hosting and running websites, and Digital Publishing Suite Single Edition for publishing and monetizing digital content as apps on tablet devices. We also anticipate our creative services will include access to: TypeKit, for making expressive type available anywhere on the web; Adobe Story Plus for cloud-based, collaborative scriptwriting and scheduling for professional writers and preproduction professionals; and file storage in the cloud, to seamlessly access, synchronize and share content between a member's Creative Cloud account and their PC and tablet devices. Some of these services will be included when Creative Cloud is initially made available, and others are expected to be rolled out over time.Our Creative Cloud offering, marketed as a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, is expected to be available in 2012 and we believe it will be a catalyst for revenue growth in the coming years. By increasing the value we provide to our core creative customers with Creative Cloud services, we anticipate we can grow our revenue per customer over time as they begin to use additional features available to them in the offering. We also believe the monthly pricing model will be attractive to users of older versions of our products who desire to use our latest releases and services, but who have not been willing to upgrade to newer versions due to their price sensitivity, and, therefore, will increase our revenue potential with them.  Similarly, we anticipate we can drive significant new user adoption for our creative tools business over the next several years in markets outside of our core creative professional targeted market because of the attractive monthly subscription pricing combined with the strong brand of our creative tools and the broad value proposition that our Creative Cloud offering will provide.In addition to a monthly subscription price that will provide access to use of all of our latest creative tools and services, we anticipate we will offer subscription pricing for Creative Cloud for some of our key point products, as well as for users in the education market.  We believe this too will drive new user acquisition and increase our revenue over time.The impact of this business model shift based on the product offering and the subscription pricing will affect the revenue flow to Adobe as customers make a shift from paying upfront for the use of our software to a model where they pay over time. We expect this will increase the amount of our recurring revenue driven by Creative Cloud adoption over the next several years.  In addition to the shift in how we develop, market and license our creative tools to our customers, we have also implemented several initiatives to drive additional revenue in our Digital Media business. They include delivering advanced publishing services, enhancing the capabilities of our solutions to utilize new innovations in HTML5, and enhancing our video delivery and advertising solutions.As discussed earlier, Adobe Digital Publishing solution is an online, hosted publishing solution that enables magazine and newspaper publishers to deliver engaging, branded reading experiences of their publications to an extensive array of mobile and tablet devices. Our Digital Publishing solution utilizes flexible e-commerce models to sell single issues and subscriptions directly to consumers through mobile marketplaces, and analytics capabilities based on our Adobe Digital Marketing Suite. Content is 9Table of Contentscreated and enhanced through integration with CS5.5 to enable a complete workflow for the creation and delivery of content to mobile device users via our new Content Viewer technology. As of the end of fiscal 2011, more than 1,200 published titles have been delivered to online app stores and newsstands, reflecting the success and strong adoption of Digital Publishing solution by our publishing customers. The newly released Digital Publishing Single Edition, which can be used by customers that want to publish their content as apps in app stores on an individual and ad hoc basis, increases our market opportunity to target anyone wanting to deliver a publication via app stores. We also anticipate Digital Publishing Single Edition will be an additional service offered as part of our Creative Cloud solution in fiscal 2012.Our Business Catalyst product is another publishing service that has enjoyed strong growth over the past few years. The solution enables small-and medium-sized businesses to create and deliver a website through our hosting services. To date, over 22,000 sites are hosted with our Business Catalyst offering. Like the Digital Publishing Single Edition, we anticipate Business Catalyst will be useful to our Creative Cloud customers as part of the new offering.Adobe has long been an innovator in helping drive the HTML standards process and then delivering the best tools in the market to create websites based on HTML innovations that are enabled in browsers. As HTML5 adoption increases in the industry, it becomes a significant catalyst for revenue growth in our solutions. To address this opportunity, we are innovating across the spectrum of content creation, content delivery, and content display in browsers and mobile apps. Our innovation includes adding new capabilities to the HTML5 specification, contributing technology to open standards such as jQuery (an HTML and JavaScript library to assist with creating websites) and Webkit (the open source foundation for many popular web browsers), and adding new features to products such as InDesign and Dreamweaver to utilize these innovations occurring in web browsers. It also includes the creation and delivery of brand new HTML5-based products such as Adobe Edge, a web motion and interaction design tool; and Adobe Muse, which allows web designers to design and publish HTML websites without writing HTML code.  Both of these new tools are expected to be released as subscription-based services as part of our Creative Cloud offering in fiscal 2012.At the end of fiscal 2011 we began delivering a series of content creation tools which run on tablets such as Android and iOS-based devices. New Adobe touch apps include Photoshop Touch, Adobe Collage, Adobe Kuler, Adobe Proto and Adobe Debut. These add to existing apps we already have in the market, including Photoshop Express, Adobe Ideas and Adobe Revel. Features and capabilities of these tools are discussed later in the "Digital Media - Touch App Products" section. In addition to charging for the use of these tools in app stores, we believe the availability of these tools as part of our Creative Cloud offering will be a key benefit to users who subscribe to it. The Adobe touch apps integrate with Creative Cloud to enable customers to move between the apps and Creative Suite software, and to view, access, share, and present creative work from anywhere.With our video solutions built around Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and the Creative Suite Production Premium Suite that contains them plus other capabilities, Adobe is a leader for video and special effects editing. With our Adobe Media Server and Adobe Pass solutions, we enable video delivery capabilities to stream video over the internet in Flash video and other popular formats to PC and non-PC devices. Providing content protection, and enabling advertising models with our new video ad serving platform that we obtained in our acquisition of Auditude—combined with applying segmentation and targeting when integrated with the Digital Marketing Suite—provides Adobe with a unique end-to-end value proposition to help media companies move their video assets online and monetize them. In addition, our media products and services enable broadcasters, event organizers and marketers to reach the broadest possible audience with live video delivery as well. We believe we can drive revenue growth in this market through the adoption of our tools, the use of our media servers, and the shift of ad dollars to online advertising as part of video delivery in fiscal 2012.While we increase our investments in our solutions utilizing HTML5, we also continue to innovate in our Adobe Flash technologies. The broad reach and rapid adoption of the newest versions of our Flash technologies on personal computers allows us to rapidly innovate with our software which utilize these technologies—enabling our customers to deliver new and more engaging experiences to their constituents with the widest range of media that leverages the latest advancements in operating systems, platforms, devices and rich media technologies. Going forward, we are most focused on enhancing the gaming and premium video delivery aspects of our Flash technology-based solutions for PC use.We also continue to invest in our cross-platform client technology named Adobe AIR. The AIR runtime enables developers to deploy standalone applications and games built with ActionScript, Flex, Flash Professional, and Flash Builder across platforms and devices—including Android, BlackBerry, iOS devices, PCs, and televisions. Supplementing our AIR strategy is our PhoneGap Build offering. Based on the open source PhoneGap framework, PhoneGap Build enables users to build cross-platform mobile applications using HTML5 and JavaScript that run on popular mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS and BlackBerry. 10Table of ContentsAs millions of web developers and website designers look to build mobile apps to increase their engagement with their constituents, we believe our AIR and PhoneGap solutions enable them to build cross-platform apps as well as reuse existing browser-based content they've created to deliver standalone apps on popular smartphones and tablets.Document Services Market Opportunities and StrategiesAs part of our Digital Media focus, we address the needs of the knowledge worker customer whom we define as someone working in document intensive industries, focused on creating and disseminating high-value information as part of their job on a regular basis. Knowledge workers include a wide variety of job functions such as accountants, attorneys, architects, educators, engineers, graphic designers, insurance underwriters and stock analysts. These jobs typically require the sharing of information either as a static, published document or as a collaborative, interactive document.Knowledge workers must create information and content from a variety of sources and software applications, and be able to exchange this information within a reliable format that ensures coworkers and constituents can reliably and securely access the information. When appropriate, this information often needs to be protected, authenticated, or securely managed and controlled.Document-based collaboration among knowledge workers can occur through face-to-face meetings, via phone calls, through e-mail or through web conferencing technologies. Knowledge workers who participate in collaborations with their colleagues may be located in offices next door to each other, or in different parts of the world. These team members may change with every project and either be part of an organization's employee base, or be an external consultant or third-party partner.  We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide solutions which enable knowledge workers to communicate and collaborate across technical, geographical and social boundaries, both inside and outside of their companies. We believe that with such solutions, users can collaborate and efficiently manage feedback from their colleagues in both real time and on-demand, and control how, when and by whom information is accessed.Since the early 1990s, our Acrobat family of products has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or interacted with utilizing the free Adobe Reader. Available in different versions which target a variety of user needs, Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide range of ad hoc tasks involving digital documents ranging from simple publications to forms to mission critical engineering and architectural plans. Although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are tens of millions of users who need capabilities such as those provided by Acrobat who have not yet licensed an Acrobat solution.For several years, we have offered our Acrobat.com hosted service to provide knowledge workers with centralized online file sharing and storage capabilities, as well as simple PDF creation, converting PDF to other file formats,  and personal web conferencing services with Adobe ConnectNow. In addition to complementing our Acrobat desktop solutions, Acrobat.com has served as an introductory service for knowledge workers who wish to utilize PDF-creation capabilities and the Adobe Reader, but have not yet licensed an Acrobat desktop solution.In fiscal 2012, we plan to continue to market the benefits of our knowledge worker solutions to small-and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. With our Acrobat family of products, we intend to continue to increase our seat penetration in these markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as expanding into emerging markets.In the coming year, we also intend to build on our experience with Acrobat.com to provide additional cloud-based document services which augment our Acrobat strategy. Our Adobe SendNow feature is one aspect of our strategy, allowing users to deliver large electronic files over the web with security and fidelity.Another aspect of our document services strategy is targeting the market of electronic signatures used to sign contracts. In fiscal 2011 we acquired EchoSign, a provider of on-demand, web-based, electronic signature solutions. Utilizing a simplistic model that doesn't require scanning software, signature pads or digital certificates, EchoSign is used to sign nearly one million contracts per month. We intend to integrate EchoSign's solution into our offerings, and it will be a cornerstone for how we grow our document services, cloud-based revenue in fiscal 2012. In addition, by making the cloud-based EchoSign capabilities available to millions of Adobe Reader users, we believe we can substantially grow the awareness of our solution in the broader contract delivery and signing market particularly where paper and overnight express mailing continues to be used.11Table of ContentsDigital Marketing SegmentDigital Marketing OpportunityConsumers today can interact with businesses across multiple channels and devices, and it is up to businesses to figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impact success. Marketing executives need to know that their investment is optimizing consumers' experiences and delivering the greatest return on their marketing spend. Online marketing goals must map clearly to overarching business objectives, and marketing executives are expected to demonstrate the success of their programs using solid metrics. In this environment, gleaning insight in real time across channels is essential.We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. This market opportunity is accelerating as Chief Marketing Officers (“CMOs”) and marketers are being given spending budgets to utilize new tools and solutions that enable them to migrate their marketing to be more digital-based. To enable this transformation, CMOs and marketers require new content architectures, new analytic systems, new media buying systems and optimization systems to increase the effectiveness of their engagement with customers. Driving visitor traffic to websites (broadly defined as a customer's digital presence, including its traditional site, mobile site, pages and apps on social networks, and all other content that is distributed throughout the internet) was an early goal of digital marketing spend, but this has broadened to include the need to measure and understand customer web traffic patterns and the effectiveness of their visitor acquisition efforts. Web analytics solutions have provided insight for digital marketers and web analysts that helps them optimize their online ad spending. Moving forward, the goals of digital marketers have evolved to include how websites and marketing campaigns can convert visitors to customers, and how these websites and marketing campaigns can be more personalized to drive better engagement and higher revenue.Our Digital Marketing Business Unit targets this large and growing opportunity by providing a comprehensive solution that includes web analytics, online business optimization and web experience management products, solutions and services. We deliver these capabilities through our Digital Marketing Suite, which is our umbrella offering and includes our Day CQ5 WEM offerings as well as the offerings gained through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier, a leader in optimizing multi-channel and auction-based digital advertising across search, display and social media. Customers use these products and services to manage and optimize online, offline, digital and multi-channel business initiatives.The Adobe Digital Marketing Suite is a collection of web analytics marketing campaign management and website optimization products that provide insight into the performance of online marketing initiatives, empowering organizations to make informed decisions, and ensure the success of online marketing programs for both advertisers and publishers. Our offering:•Enables digital marketers to align online marketing initiatives with overarching business objectives and demonstrate the success of online marketing programs using metrics•Manages, collects, and brings data together from multiple systems into a flexible, integrated platform•Provides real-time business intelligence through segmentation, dashboards and reports that managers can use to gain a complete picture of how consumers are interacting with the business•Creates the ability to monetize and share data through audience optimization capabilities; publishers can quickly identify audiences that match the profiles that advertisers are demanding—and maximize the value of their digital assets•Optimizes ad spend by maximizing the impact of a company's advertising spend across and within channels—including search, display, video, mobile, social media and other digitally connected forms of media—to yield the greatest returns•Delivers relevant and engaging digital content across channels that boosts key performance metrics, whether it is a customer purchase, engagement, a download, form completion, or other desired outcome.As part of our Digital Marketing Suite, our Day WEM solution enables us to help organizations re-platform their websites by enabling them to create, manage, distribute, and monetize content while optimizing the web, mobile, and social collaboration experience for their customers. Combining our Digital Marketing Suite and Day offerings into a more robust offering enables our customers to effectively manage all aspects of how they engage their customers and constituents through their websites. More specifically, we believe we can enable the delivery of customer-facing web and mobile solutions by extending enterprise services beyond interactive applications, documents, and workflows to include comprehensive WEM such as personalization of content, rich media delivery capabilities, mobile application delivery,  social collaboration and deep integration into back-office systems such as e-commerce platforms.12Table of ContentsUsers of our digital marketing solutions include marketing professionals such as the chief marketing officer, marketing managers, online marketing managers, search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. Customers also include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our digital media tools and our video workflow and delivery technologies.These users are faced with several major market trends, and their choices for how they address these challenges are creating opportunities for our digital marketing business:•Broad commercial utilization of the internet—The internet has fundamentally altered the way businesses and consumers purchase and consume goods and services. It has also redefined many business processes and has created opportunities for new online businesses, as well as for existing offline businesses seeking to capitalize on online initiatives. Because of this, businesses are investing in innovative online initiatives to increase sales, improve customer service, enhance brand awareness, decrease time-to-market for their offerings, reduce fulfillment costs and increase operational efficiency. We expect that the scope and scale of commercial internet usage will continue to increase. The roll-out of broadband networks and mobile networks, particularly in emerging geographic markets, will contribute to the growth of internet usage. Internet commerce should also continue to grow. Proliferation of online marketing and customer response channels—such as mobile, digital video, and social networks—will continue to generate interactions that need to be measured, analyzed and optimized across channels.•Need to measure online business—In order to make informed decisions about priorities and investments in online marketing and other commercial initiatives, we believe businesses require timely and accurate measurement of customer behavior. The proliferation of internet usage and the fact that nearly every user interaction on a website (or other digital medium such as mobile phone applications, set-top boxes, kiosks, point of sale systems or any IP connected device) can be captured by the owner of the website, or other digital medium, have resulted in the creation of an unprecedented amount of data about how a business' customers interact and transact business with it. Businesses are increasingly realizing the benefit of using information gained from online and other digital customer interactions to improve functional areas, such as sales, customer service, product development, marketing, pricing, manufacturing and inventory management. The interactive and measurable nature of internet activity also enables businesses to determine how customers arrived at their online destinations, such as through paid search, a display ad or a social media website. It also enables businesses to determine which advertising mediums are yielding the greatest ROI, including whether visitors convert to customers once they have reached their destination site.•Opportunity to optimize and automate online business—Measuring online activity and automating the capture and analysis of data are important for making informed business decisions. Businesses also need to leverage data to optimize the results of their online business activities. For example, businesses have historically measured the success of their online marketing programs by simple click-through rates or conversion rates, the latter being the percentage of click-through users who make a purchase or otherwise engage in the desired customer action during the online session. However, the effectiveness of online marketing can be optimized by analyzing and acting on deeper information, such as repeat visits, transactions generated, registrations, traffic pathways (various paths of online visitor traffic flow), time spent and quality of interaction (engagement), eventual conversion (desired customer action taken in subsequent visits) or success over time (lifetime value of customer) as well as comparing the relative effectiveness of different marketing channels (attribution). Business success metrics can also vary based on the industry or vertical market—for example, media companies drive engagement to optimize subscriptions and online advertising revenue, whereas retailers and e-commerce companies focus on promotions and maximizing online purchases. Online businesses utilize a large and growing number of complex and diverse advertising and communication channels to market to customers, including display advertising, paid and natural search advertising, e-mail, social media marketing, affiliate marketing, blogs, podcasts, video, games, RIAs and comparison shopping engines, as well as traditional offline initiatives. The emergence of multi-channel marketing initiatives, which combine traditional offline marketing initiatives such as television, print, magazine, newspapers, radio and catalog with online marketing initiatives, makes the measurement and analysis of online activity more challenging, but presents additional opportunities to optimize results. For example, businesses want to measure and understand the impact of their advertising initiatives across all these channels, not only to determine how much credit should be given to a particular channel and to understand cross-promotional effectiveness, but more importantly to optimize their advertising spending and make adjustments in the way channels are utilized and align the amount of resources that are allocated to each of them.Given the market trends described above, we believe the combination of our Digital Media tools, our Digital Marketing solutions, including our Day WEM offering and the offerings gained through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier, helps customers to more efficiently and effectively create, measure, analyze and optimize those experiences—creating a complete feedback loop. With this broad platform, Adobe has the opportunity to deliver an end-to-end workflow that will allow customers to create, deliver, monetize, and optimize the impact and business results of their content and assets.13Table of ContentsDigital Marketing StrategyIn the coming year, our plan is to build upon the momentum we achieved in fiscal 2011 by focusing on four key initiatives:•Analytics & Reporting—Enhancing our web analytics and reporting offering•Personalized Engagement—Driving improved capabilities for personalized engagement•Multi-Channel Campaign Management—Enabling our customers to implement solutions for multi-channel campaign management•Media Monetization—Creating a more robust offering for customers to monetize their media.In analytics and reporting, we will focus on helping our customers understand the performance of their business across all digital channels and support their needs for integrating offline channels (through offerings like Adobe Insight). Customers desire to know what the performance is across their efforts in video, social, mobile and email campaigns, and look at that holistically. To do this, they require an analytics platform that can assemble data across all those channels to gain better insight and drive informed decision making.Personalized engagement is a priority for digital marketers; once they obtain visitors to their websites, they desire to create the best possible experience for their visitors. With analytics data and web optimization solutions, they can also personalize that experience to make it dynamic and relevant to each visitor. Our digital marketing and WEM offering can help its users author, manage and deliver personalized experiences based on many criteria, including analytics data related to a visitor's prior visits to a site, or based on their purchasing history, or what keyword they clicked on in a web search that brought them to a site or in many cases, to a distributed part of its site such as a social network page or app for that customer. The Context Optional functionality acquired through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier enables customers to build and deliver engaging experiences on social networks. With geo-location services on smartphones and tablets, insight can be gained on the geographic location of a visitor, leading to personalized content and marketing offers for that particular geographic market. Delivering content pertinent to PCs versus mobile devices is also a factor. With improved integration in our analytics, visitor conversion tools and Day WEM offering, we can offer a complete solution for personalized engagement.As more marketing spend moves towards digital delivery, marketers have to spend and optimize their ad budgets across many digital channels including search, display, video, mobile and social. These channels are rapidly evolving and innovative technology is required for marketers to keep up, particularly because we do not see these channels operating in silos, rather they operate as a portfolio of activities that must be managed and optimized as such. They need to understand what is working, and what is not working. For example, a particular creative asset may drive more conversion on a particular social site, but not on its PC-based site,  or visitors to a mobile site may be more enticed to purchase based on a particular offer versus another.  Across all these channels, customers face the challenge of selecting which campaigns and digital assets to deploy. And they wish to do this real-time. We believe this presents a large and untapped opportunity for Adobe to help digital marketing customers manage this complexity and achieve results.In the area of media monetization, a customer such as a Chief Revenue Officer regularly asks the question, “How do I sell my available advertising inventory for higher rates, across all the digital channels available to me?” We believe, through our Digital Marketing Suite offering combined with our new data management capabilities, we can help customers such as publishers gather data and adjust their advertising sales models to optimize their revenue. Key aspects of our strategy in media monetization are to help our customers segment and target specific audiences, perform audience research, and manage the data associated with their targeted audiences. With our acquisition of Auditude, we also believe we will be able to further help our customers monetize their media by applying these segmentation and targeting capabilities to increase the revenue they obtain through ad delivery in online video.As part of these initiatives, we believe we can accelerate the growth of our digital marketing business by expanding our go-to-market strategy to include new geographies and vertical markets where Adobe has a strong presence. We also believe we can grow the business by expanding what we offer and better integrating the services in our Digital Marketing Suite, including improving integration with our digital media tools and our Day experience management products, and by delivering “one click” optimization capabilities for vertical market solutions such as our Digital Publishing solution and our video delivery and monetization platform.Digital Enterprise Solutions StrategyOur Adobe LiveCycle and Adobe Connect products help customers automate paper intensive processes, improve collaboration, provide better customer service and reduce costs. We believe our offerings can transform customer experiences in these markets. 14Table of ContentsWith our LiveCycle offerings, we enable our customers to eliminate paper and move to automated forms-based workflows, which continue to be key challenges in enterprises and governments around the world. Paper remains prevalent throughout industries and governments, and many organizations are seeking to drive down operational costs related to paper use and workflows involving paper-based documents. During the past decade, there has been considerable progress made towards moving away from paper-based workflows. However, we believe there still remains a significant opportunity to deliver solutions that focus on this opportunity.Adobe Connect provides capabilities for live web conferencing, as well as delivering on-demand rich presentations through an on-premise server or as a hosted service and for recording and delivering such content later. Web conferencing services are provided via the ubiquitous Adobe Flash Player client on PCs, as well as through smartphone and tablet device applications running natively on operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android.In the fall of 2011, we announced we would align our enterprise go-to-market efforts around our digital marketing solutions. As part of this decision, we indicated our LiveCycle and Connect offerings will be focused primarily on two key vertical industries: financial services and government. For these customers, we offer comprehensive, scalable, secure and reliable server products, SaaS offerings and tools to develop applications tailored to their specific information and business process requirements.Print and Publishing SegmentOur Print and Publishing business segment contains several of our products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. These opportunities and the key products we offer to address them in fiscal 2012 are reviewed below.Increasingly, eLearning solutions are becoming more prevalent as a means to create and deliver online and electronic learning experiences. These experiences range from online assessments, surveys and quizzes—to online reference and instruction manuals—to real time learning and web-based collaboration experiences. We believe we have a rich legacy in the development and delivery of eLearning tools, and can innovate by providing new features and platform reach for eLearning content delivery with our set of offerings.Our ColdFusion offering provides fast and easy ways to build and deploy powerful internet applications. Developers can extend or integrate ColdFusion with Java or .NET applications, connect to enterprise data and applications, create and interact via web services, or interface with SMS on mobile devices or instant messaging clients. ColdFusion can also be used for business reporting, rich-forms generation, printable document generation, full-text search and graphing and charting-enabling customers to more fully engage their constituents with better web experiences. Graphics professionals and professional publishers require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and we believe our printing technology provides advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry. We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output devices. In fiscal 2012, we plan to continue to enhance PostScript as well as utilize PDF enhancements to maintain these formats as standards in publishing and printing work flows.Fiscal 2012 Business Segment ProductsDigital Media —Creative ProductsAdobe After Effects—software used to create sophisticated animation, motion graphics and visual effects found in television broadcast, film, DVD authoring and the web;

Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes. Digital MediaIn our Digital Media segment, we offer the Adobe Creative Suite in multiple editions which consist of combinations of several of our technologies. In addition to offering the technologies within the Creative Suite editions, we also offer them as individual software applications. These products compete with those from many companies, including Apple, Aviary, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Quark and others, as well as from many lower-end offerings available on touch-enabled devices via app stores, and from various open source initiatives.Of the competitors listed, no single company has offerings identical to our Creative Suite family of products. Microsoft, with its Expression line of products, competes with several aspects of our Creative Suite family of products. For example, Expression Studio Ultimate includes: Microsoft Expression Design, which competes with our Illustrator and  Fireworks products; Microsoft Expression Blend, which competes with our new Adobe Edge product as well as our Flash authoring products; and Microsoft Expression Web, which competes with our Dreamweaver product. Similarly, Aviary provides for free a set of online, cloud-based creative tools via its website. Its tools run inside web browsers and include an image editor, a vector graphics editor, a special effects tool, and audio and music tools.We believe our Creative Suite family of products competes favorably on the basis of features and functionality, ease of use, product reliability, value and performance characteristics. The individual technologies within the Creative Suite editions also work well together, providing broader functionality and shortened product training time for the individual who uses multiple applications to complete a project.25Table of ContentsWe also believe our individual Creative products compete favorably against those offered by competitors noted above, as discussed below.Our InDesign product, used for professional page layout, faces competition from offerings such as Quark Xpress in the professional page layout market. We believe InDesign competes favorably due to InDesign's innovative features, its improved integration with our other products, our strong brand among users, positive reviews by industry experts, and more recent innovations which address customer challenges related to publishing for tablets which is delivered in concert with our new Digital Publishing solution offerings.Professional drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand awareness and price sensitivity. In addition to competition with Microsoft's Expression Design product, our Adobe Illustrator product faces competition from companies such as ACDsee, Aviary, Corel, Mediascape, Xara and the open source product called Karbon14. Competition in this market is also emerging with a new category of drawing and illustration applications on tablet and smartphone platforms. We offer Adobe Ideas for graphics creation on tablets, and other software companies, including Autodesk with its SketchBook Pro application, are extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apple's iPad and potentially other tablet devices. We believe our products compete favorably due to high customer awareness of their rich features, especially the drawing and illustration functionalities, the technical capabilities of the product and our ability to leverage core technologies from our other established products.The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly evolving and highly volatile. In addition to competition with Microsoft's Expression Blend and web products, we believe Dreamweaver and Flash Professional face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies such as Bare Bones Software, FlashDevelop, JetBrains, Panic, MacRabbit, MacroMates, and various proprietary and open source web authoring tools. We also face competition from Microsoft Visual Studio products, and other IDEs that enable developers to create web applications from companies such as BEA Systems (a subsidiary of Oracle), Borland (owned by Micro Focus) and IBM. We believe our products compare favorably to these applications; however, our market share may be constrained by Microsoft's ability to target its web software to users in markets it dominates. These target customers include users of Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows operating system, the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser and Microsoft Visual Studio.Our Flash technologies, including Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR, face competition from alternative approaches to building rich content and web applications such as JavaFX, HTML5, native application and Unity.The HTML specification, which among other things describes the syntax and format for encoding web pages, has evolved over several decades and Adobe has participated in its evolution. Our tools are among the leading applications used by web designers and developers to create HTML-based content that is displayed and viewed in web browsers.The newest version of HTML, commonly known as HTML5, is being developed by an industry consortium that includes Adobe and leading browser manufacturers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, and contains new features which compete with some of the features of Flash and Adobe Flash Player. These features include the ability to create and display rich advertising and play video natively within the browser. We are working to implement support for HTML5 in our creative product solutions, and we believe we will provide the widest array of support and tooling for HTML5 content creation over time. We are also contributing Adobe technology to WebKit, the open source project utilized by popular internet browsers such as Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome browser, to improve the user experience for HTML5-based content in areas like publishing and animated graphics. By increasing the capabilities for displaying rich content in browsers with HTML5, we believe we can increase the desire by web content creators for our tools that create such content.As it relates to Flash, we believe that Flash technology-based content and tooling have a significant technology lead over other solutions trying to replicate its feature sets on PC-based systems, particularly in use cases such as online gaming, web applications and RIAs, 3D-based content, and premium online video delivery. Given Apple's considerable market share with smartphones and tablets, and Apple's decision to not support Adobe Flash Player on its mobile devices, we have decided (based on this and other factors) to discontinue new development on Adobe Flash Player for mobile implementations.As it relates to HTML5, we believe demand for authoring new HTML5 features will intensify the competition in the professional web page layout market. We also believe the potential fragmentation of HTML5 implementations by the various browser manufacturers that compete with each other will create the need for tool improvements to address the disparities between platforms and devices that could result. Our Dreamweaver product and our new Adobe Edge and Adobe Muse tools are well positioned to assist customers with migrating to new versions of standards such as HTML5, as well as delivering the means to create rich, interactive experiences on devices and screens of all sizes. We expect new tools and solutions to come to market that will compete with our tools. However, we believe our continuing innovation in our tools, and how these tools are integrated with other Adobe technologies that are used by web content creators, creates a value proposition that is greater than those trying to compete with our web page content creation offerings.26Table of ContentsAs customers such as publishers and media companies increase their desire to deliver their assets to new platforms such as mobile devices and tablets, we expect new and existing companies to continue to offer solutions that address these challenges that are competitive with our Digital Publishing solution. Many design agencies are building capabilities to offer such solutions, and companies such as Amazon, Apple, Aquafada, Google, Texterity and Zinio offer an alternative format and business model for the delivery of newspaper and magazine content to mobile devices.We believe RIAs will make use of both open source Ajax frameworks and the open source Flex framework to create hybrid RIAs in the browser, and we anticipate increased adoption of AIR as a development platform for Ajax developers. With our Adobe Media Server solution, we face competition from Microsoft with its Windows Media Server for Windows Media and Silverlight, as well as Apple, Move Networks, Real Networks, Wowza Media Systems and others.Our tools used to create applications for PCs and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are influenced by evolving industry standards, rapid software and hardware technology developments and frequent new product and technology introductions by companies or open-source initiatives targeting similar opportunities. Technologies and products that compete with our tools for creating mobile applications include solutions that utilize Java, BREW, Scalable Vector Graphics and Wireless Application Protocol. On Apple devices running the iOS operating system, on devices running Microsoft operating systems and on devices running the Google Android operating system, developers can choose to use native development environments for those platforms. They can also utilize other developer solutions that can be compiled to run on such devices, including those from companies such as Appcelerator, Unity3D, Sencha and Strobe.We believe our robust programming model and developer tools used to create rich content, our large developer community and ecosystem that utilize our tools and the growth of companies who utilize our Flash, AIR and PhoneGap Build solutions as a basis for rich content and application delivery across multiple screens are key assets in our ability to effectively compete in this market. Further, the rich expressiveness of Flash, which provides the capability to deliver audio, video, motion graphics, vector graphics and visual effects resulting in rich user experiences and interfaces on mobile devices, is a key differentiation when compared to the capabilities of alternate solutions.The needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, PCs, tablets, mobile phones and other new devices. Our imaging and video software offerings, including Photoshop, Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Elements, After Effects, Adobe Audition, Soundbooth, Encore, Adobe Premiere Elements and Adobe Premiere Pro, face competition from companies offering similar products. We also continue to face competition from new and free products, including web services and mobile/tablet applications that compete directly with our Adobe Revel, Photoshop Express and Photoshop Touch mobile application offerings.In professional digital imaging, software applications and services compete based on product features, brand awareness and price sensitivity. In addition to competition with Apple's Aperture product and Microsoft's Expression Design product, our Photoshop and Photoshop Lightroom products face direct and indirect competition from a number of companies, including Corel. New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional products are also emerging as adoption of these devices grows. Our Adobe Photoshop products compete favorably due to high customer awareness of the Photoshop brand in digital imaging, the positive recommendations for our Photoshop product by market influencers, the features and technical capabilities of the product and our ability to leverage core features from our other established products.Our other digital imaging and video editing offerings, including Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements, are subject to intense competition, including customer price sensitivity, competitor brand awareness and competitor strength in OEM bundling and retail distribution. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging market from a number of companies that market software that competes with ours, including ACD Systems, AI Soft (Japan), Apple, ArcSoft, Corel, i4 (Japan), Google, Kodak, Nova Development, Magix, Microsoft, Photodex Corporation, Sonic (owned by Rovi), Pinnacle (owned by Avid) and Sony.In addition, we face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers such as Apple, Canon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Nikon, Phase One, Sony and others as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software, or those of our competitors. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating system manufacturers such as Apple with their iPhoto product and Microsoft as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems. We also face potential competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, new social networking platforms such as Facebook and portal sites such as Google and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images—bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software.Competition is also emerging with a new category of imaging and video applications on tablet and smartphone platforms. Existing as well as new competitors are extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apple's iPad and potentially other tablet devices. Similarly, new cloud-based SaaS offerings continue to emerge which offer image editing and video-editing 27Table of Contentscapabilities, as well as social and sharing features. In addition to competing with our own mobile applications such as Photoshop Express, our Lightroom product and our Elements hobbyist products, these products could start to encroach upon the feature sets of our professional tools.Applications for digital video editing, motion graphics, special effects, audio creation and DVD authoring face increasing competition as video professionals and hobbyists migrate towards the use of digital camcorders and digital video production on their computers, and DVD systems and online video for rich media playback. Our After Effects, Adobe Audition,  Encore, Adobe Premiere Pro and Soundbooth software products, as well as the Adobe Production Premium suite which contains these products, face competition from companies such as Apple, Avid, Canopus (owned by Grass Valley), Sonic (owned by Rovi) and Sony.Our Adobe Premiere Elements software product, which is targeted for use by hobbyists, faces competition from companies such as Apple, ArcSoft, Autodesk, Avid, Broderbund, Corel, Magix, Microsoft and Sony as well as video editing capabilities found in operating systems, hosted SaaS solutions, video editing solutions bundled by video camcorder manufacturers with their hardware offerings, and video editing solutions bundled onto smartphones. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating system manufacturers such as Apple with its iMovie and iDVD products and Microsoft with its Windows Movie Maker product as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems.We believe we compete favorably against other digital imaging, digital video and consumer-focused image management software applications with our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products due to strong consumer awareness of our brand in digital imaging and digital video, our relationships with significant OEMs, positive recommendations for our products by market influencers, our focus on the retail software channel and strong feature sets.After Effects is a leader in professional compositing and visual effects due to its strong feature set and its integration with our other products that helps create a broad video editing platform for our customers. In professional digital video editing, we are an industry leader with Adobe Premiere Pro and compete favorably due to our strong feature set, our OEM relationships and the integration with our other products to create a broad digital video publishing platform for our customers.With our Acrobat business, we continue to face competition from Microsoft. Their widely used Office product offers a feature to save Microsoft Office documents as PDF documents, which competes with Acrobat. They also offer a proprietary digital rights management technology and a document format, called XML Paper Specification (“XPS”), which competes with Adobe PDF. Given Microsoft's market dominance, the PDF feature in Office, XPS, and any other competitive Microsoft product or technology that is bundled as part of its Office product or operating system or made freely available, could harm our overall Acrobat market opportunity.Our Acrobat product family also faces competition in the PDF file creation market from many clone products marketed by companies such as AdLib, Active PDF, Apple, Global Graphics, Nuance, Software995, Sourcenext and others. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost, or for free, on the web.For customers that use Acrobat as part of document collaboration and document process management solutions, where electronic document delivery, exchange, collaboration, security and archival needs exist, our Acrobat product family faces competition from entrenched office applications such as Microsoft Office and its integration with its SharePoint product. In the higher end of the electronic document market, Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended provide features which compete with other creative professional PDF tool providers, such as Enfocus, Dalim and Zinio. Google's Google Apps set of products also provides document creation and collaboration capabilities, including the ability to preview PDF documents, which can be used as an alternative to our collaboration features in Acrobat.To address these competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Adobe Acrobat applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emerging opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security.Digital Marketing The markets in which our Digital Marketing business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense competition. Our Digital Marketing solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, HP, salesforce.com and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets, increasing competition. Certain of these competitors provide software on demand to customers, generally through a web browser, or provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In addition, we compete at times with our customers' or potential customers' internally developed applications. Of the competitors listed, no single company has products identical to our Digital Marketing offerings. Our Digital Marketing solutions compete in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; multi-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; web experience management and others. 28Table of ContentsOur current principal competitors for our reporting and analytics offerings include companies that offer web analytics and optimization services on-demand such as  ComScore (which recently acquired AdXpose), Google, IBM (which owns Coremetrics and Unica), Microsoft, WebTrends and Yahoo!. We also compete with software and business intelligence vendors, such as Infor (which owns Epiphany), Nielsen/NetRatings (which is a part of the Nielsen Online Unit of the Nielsen Company) and SAS Institute. In addition, we also compete with online marketing service providers, such as Microsoft Advertising (formerly aQuantive when acquired by Microsoft), DoubleClick (owned by Google) and 24/7 Real Media (acquired by WPP). Our Insight products compete with channel analytics providers, such as Truviso, Clickfox, QlikTech and AsterData (owned by Teradata). In addition to competing with large search, display and social companies, our SearchCenter products and multi-channel campaign management offerings, including those obtained through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier, compete with point solutions providers such as DecideDNA (owned by WPP), DoubleClick Search (owned by Google), IgnitionOne, Marin Software and Kenshoo. Our Test&Target products compete with multivariate testing providers, such as Optimost (owned by HP), Memetrics (owned by Accenture), Kefta (owned by Acxiom Digital) and [x + 1]. Our SiteSearch, Search&Promote and Merchandising products compete with intra-site search vendors and merchandising solutions providers such as Autonomy (owned by HP), Endeca Technologies (owned by Oracle), FAST Search and Transfer ASA (owned by Microsoft), Google, Celebros, SLI Systems, Nextopia Software and Fredhopper. Our SocialAnalytics product, as well as our Context Optional offerings obtained through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier, compete primarily with social monitoring platforms such as Radian6 (owned by salesforce.com) and Visible Technologies, as well as with social marketing companies such as Buddy Media, Vitrue and Lithium Technologies. Our Day Web Experience Management solution competes with: general enterprise content platforms, including products from Documentum (owned by EMC), HP (which recently acquired Autonomy), IBM, OpenText, and Oracle (which recently acquired FatWire); content management tools like Microsoft SharePoint; large-scale WEM systems from companies such as Vignette (owned by OpenText); and more specialized solutions, including products from Alfresco, CoreMedia, Percussion, and SDL. In addition, there are low-cost and open source alternatives, such as Drupal, Joomla!, and WordPress. Many of the companies with which we compete offer a variety of products or services and as a result could also bundle their products or services, which may result in these companies effectively selling their products or services at or below market prices. In addition, large software, internet and database management companies have expanded and enhanced their offerings in the digital marketing area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. For example, Apple provides its iAd service, Google offers both a free and premium web analytics service and acquired DoubleClick, one of our strategic partners, in 2007. Also, Microsoft offers a web analytics service, and offers Microsoft Advertising, which is based on Microsoft's 2007 acquisition of aQuantive; Yahoo! also offers a web analytics service based on its acquisition of IndexTools; Salesforce.com acquired Radian6 to provide services to monitor and analyze social media conversations; Oracle acquired Endeca Technologies and FatWire, and HP acquired Autonomy (which had previously acquired Interwoven) to increase their presences in the digital marketing space; and IBM, with its Coremetrics and Unica acquisitions, has extended its e-retailing offering in an initiative it calls Project Northstar. These competitors, given their significant resources and preexisting relationships with our current and potential customers, could compete effectively against us.We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of services' user interfaces; the low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; the ability of services to provide N-dimensional segmentation of information; pricing; the flexibility and adaptability of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services, including services being easy to learn and remember, efficient and visually compelling; the real-time availability of data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally and to provide multi-currency, multi-language and multi-character support and to have a local presence in international markets; and success in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe that we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives, based on many of these competitive factors  including our strong feature set, the  breadth of our offerings, our focus  on global, multi-brand, multi-   language websites, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, multi-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.Our web conferencing solution, Adobe Connect, faces competition from many web conferencing vendors, including Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Office Live Meeting (now a part of their Microsoft Lync offering), IBM Lotus Sametime and Citrix GoToMeeting (and their recent acquisition of NetViewer). Cisco WebEx is a market share leader, and Microsoft has steadily increased its marketing of its solution as well as acquired Skype which is a service that enables video calls via the internet.29Table of ContentsMicrosoft has brought to market products and technologies to address many of the market needs we focus on with our LiveCycle family of products. Microsoft offers its eForms solution called InfoPath in certain versions of Microsoft Office and has added Office Forms Services which extends their forms to users as MS Outlook e-mail messages or to web browsers rather than the InfoPath client. They also continue to offer their Windows Rights Management Services in their Windows Server product which is designed to allow corporate networks to manage and enforce restrictions built into documents.Certain Windows operating systems contain a proprietary digital rights management technology which competes with our LiveCycle Rights Management. In addition, Microsoft's Office product includes SharePoint which competes with certain aspects of our LiveCycle products. Microsoft has also delivered technology called Windows Presentation Foundation and Silverlight which offers an alternative to building RIA applications within the Microsoft .NET framework.In the electronic forms solution market, in addition to competition from Microsoft Infopath based solutions, we face competition from IBM through their eForms solution recently rebranded as Lotus Workplace Forms. Similarly, we face competition for document process management solutions from workflow solution vendors such as PegaSystems, Lombardi (owned by IBM), Nuance and Ultimus.Print and PublishingOur Print and Publishing product line targets many markets. In technical authoring and publishing, our Adobe FrameMaker product faces competition from large-scale electronic publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies such as PTC, as well as lower-end desktop publishing products such as Microsoft Word. Competition is based on the quality and features of products, the level of customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hard-ware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of the FrameMaker product and our extensive application programming interface.In desktop publishing, our Adobe PageMaker product faces competition from other software products, including Microsoft Publisher. Competition is based on the quality and features of products, ease-of-use, printer service support and price. We believe we have a strong product and can successfully compete with these types of applications based upon the quality and features of the PageMaker product, its strong brand among users and its widespread adoption among printer service bureaus.In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability, price, support and engineering development assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency, OEM customer relationships and our intellectual property portfolio. Adobe PostScript faces competition from Hewlett-Packard's proprietary PCL page description language and from developers of other page description languages based on the PostScript language standard, including Global Graphics and Zoran. In addition, Microsoft's XPS document format and Autodesk's DWG format compete with Adobe PDF and our PostScript technologies and solutions.In the rapid eLearning authoring market, our Adobe eLearning Suite and our Adobe Captivate product face competition from general content development tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint, screen recording tools such as Techsmith's Camtasia and more advanced eLearning and software simulation solutions such as Firefly, Lectora and Articulate. Competition in this market is based on speed of development and completeness of the features of products, ease-of-use and price. We believe our product can successfully compete based upon the strength of its broad range of features, its strong brand among users and its widespread adoption among training developers. Our Adobe Contribute product faces competition from solutions that provide for the simple creation of blogs and “Wikis,” as well as basic content publishing products such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft FrontPage, Microsoft Notepad, basic HTML editors like ezHTMLArea and ekTron, and content management solutions similar to those with which our Day Web Experience Management solution competes. Competition in this market is based on usability, quality and features of products, the level of customization and integration with other WEM components, the integration with web design tools, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the usability and price of  Contribute, its strong brand among users and integration with other WEM components.In multimedia content authoring, our Adobe Director product faces competition from a variety of multimedia content authoring tools. Competition is based on the quality and features of products, ease-of-use and price. We believe we have a strong product and can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of the Director product, its strong brand among users, its widespread adoption among content developers and publishers and the widespread proliferation of the Adobe Shockwave Player.In technical web authoring and publishing, our Adobe RoboHelp product faces competition from large-scale web publishing systems, XML-based web publishing companies, as well as lower-end publishing products such as Microsoft Word. Competition 30Table of Contentsis based on the quality and features of products, the level of customization and integration with other publishing system components, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of the RoboHelp product.Our Adobe ColdFusion products face competition from major vendors including Microsoft, IBM and Oracle (via its BEA subsidiary and acquisition of Sun). Our ColdFusion products also compete with several technologies available today at no cost including the PHP and PERL programming environments that are available for the Apache web server.OPERATIONS Marketing and SalesWe market and distribute our products through sales channels, which include distributors, retailers, software developers, systems integrators, ISVs and VARs, as well as through OEM and hardware bundle customers. We also market and license our products directly using our sales force and through our own website at www.adobe.com.We support our end users through local field offices and our worldwide distribution network, which includes locations in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dubai, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.We also license software with maintenance and support, which includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, support, updates and enhancements.The table below lists our significant customer, as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. As listed, our significant customer is a distributor who sell products across our various segments.  2011 2010 2009Ingram Micro 14% 15% 15%We have multiple non-exclusive, independently negotiated distribution agreements with Ingram Micro and its subsidiaries covering our arrangements in specified countries and regions. Each of these contracts has an independent duration, is independent of any other agreement (such as a master distribution agreement) and any termination of one agreement does not affect the status of any of the other agreements.Receivables from our significant customer, as a percentage of gross trade receivables for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows:  2011 2010Ingram Micro 14% 14%Order Fulfillment for Physical DistributionThe procurement of the various components of packaged products, including DVDs and printed materials, and the assembly of packages for retail and other applications products is controlled by our supply chain operations organization. We outsource our production, inventory and fulfillment activities to third parties in the United States, Europe, Asia and Japan.To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our products or in the replication of DVDs, printing and assembly of components.Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog  as of January 20, 2012. Shippable backlog as of January 21, 2011 was approximately  $5.8 million.Services and SupportWe provide professional services, technical support and customer service across all our customer segments, including enterprises, small/medium businesses, creative professionals, and consumers. Our service and support revenue consists primarily of consulting fees, software maintenance and support fees and training fees.ServicesWe have a global professional services team dedicated to designing, developing and implementing solutions for enterprise customers in key vertical markets and to transfer technical expertise to our solution partners. The professional services team uses 31Table of Contentsa comprehensive, customer-focused methodology to develop high quality solutions, which in turn deliver a competitive advantage to our enterprise customers. This methodology has been developed by capturing best practices from numerous client engagements across a diverse mix of solutions, industries, and customer preferences. Based on this methodology, our teams are able to accelerate the time to value and maximize the return our clients earn on their investment in Adobe solutions.In addition, Adobe has also created a large and vibrant partner ecosystem that includes a mix of Global System Integrators ("SIs"), Regional SIs, VARs, and Solution Partners. Adobe invests significant resources in enabling this ecosystem with the right skills and knowledge about our technologies and best practices. Consequently, this ecosystem provides our clients several different choices of partners, and a large accessible pool of skilled resources that can help deploy Adobe solutions. This approach not only creates value for our customers and partners, but also creates a large and productive go-to-market channel for our sales teams.SupportA significant portion of our support revenue is composed of our extended enterprise maintenance and support offerings. These offerings entitle customers to:•the right to receive product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support period, which is typically one year,•the right to receive technical support on the technology they have purchased from Adobe and•the right to receive basic “how to” help in using our products We offer a range of support programs, from fee-based incidents to annual support contracts. Additionally, we provide extensive self-help and online technical support capabilities via the web which allows customers quick and easy access to possible solutions. Our support services also include support for our desktop products. As a registered owner of the current version of an Adobe desktop product, customers are eligible to receive Getting Started support on certain matters. Support for some products and in some countries may vary.We provide product support through a combination of outsourced vendors and internal support centers, and through multiple channels including phone, chat web, and email. These support services are delivered by a global support organization that includes several Regional and Global Support Centers. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high quality technical expertise on all our products. We also offer Developer Support to partners and developer organizations. The Adobe Partner Connection Program focuses on providing developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.TrainingWe offer a comprehensive portfolio of training options to enable our customer and partner teams in the use of our products.

We also provide fee-based  education services to enhance our customers’ use of our solutions, including a wide range of traditional and online training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals. Adobe's portfolio of technical training courses covers our Digital Media, Digital Marketing and other mature products and solutions. InvestmentsWe make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services. We also owned a limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures IV L.P. (“Adobe Ventures”) that invested in early stage companies with innovative technologies. During fiscal 2010, Adobe Ventures was dissolved and all remaining assets were distributed to the partners. Adobe Ventures was managed by Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT As the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We develop our software internally as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owned the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs 32Table of Contentsdeveloped by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, our research and development expenses were $738.1 million, $680.3 million and $565.1 million, respectively.PRODUCT PROTECTIONWe regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe our patents have value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting segments. We protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties only under limited circumstances and subject to specific security and confidentiality constraints.Our products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:(1)We offer many products on a “right to use” basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products to a designated number of devices. We also rely on copyright laws and on “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses that are not physically signed by the end user. Copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries and the enforceability of “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined in all jurisdictions. (2)We also offer products under a SaaS or on-demand model, where hosted software is provided on demand to customers, generally through a web browser. The use of these products is generally governed by terms of use associated with these products.Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry. This problem is particularly acute in international markets. We conduct anti-piracy programs directly and through certain external software associations. In addition, we have activation technology in certain products to guard against illegal use and will continue to do so in certain future products.EMPLOYEES As of December 2, 2011, we employed 9,925 people. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good.AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge on our Investor Relations website at www.adobe.com/adbe as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

RISK FACTORSAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.If we cannot continue to develop, market and distribute new products and services or upgrades or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. Our inability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms, including the mobile and non-PC devices market, and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect continued market acceptance of our products and services and our ability to develop new products and services. Additionally, any delay in the development, production, marketing or distribution of a new product or service or upgrade or enhancement to an existing product or service could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and could harm our competitive position. We maintain strategic relationships with third parties with respect to the distribution of certain of our technologies and the support of certain product functionality. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues would be impaired and our operating results would suffer.We offer our PC application-based products primarily on Windows and Macintosh platforms. To the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, to the extent that we have difficulty transitioning product or version releases to new Windows and Macintosh operating systems, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we choose and are able to offer our products on these platforms, our business could be harmed. To the extent new releases of operating systems, including for mobile and non-PC devices, or other third-party products, platforms or devices make it more difficult for our products to perform, and our customers are persuaded to use alternative technologies, our business could be harmed. Introduction of new products, services and business models by existing and new competitors could harm our competitive position and results of operations.The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards and business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent new product and service introductions, short product and service life cycles and price sensitivity on the part of consumers, all of which may result in downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rates. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes, such as the evolution and emergence of digital application marketplaces as a direct sales and software delivery environment. If any competing products, services, or operating systems achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets. Any further consolidations among our competitors may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations. For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 35Table of ContentsIf we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.We plan to release numerous new product and service offerings and employ new software delivery methods in connection with our diversification into new business models and markets. It is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Market acceptance of these new product and service offerings will be dependent on our ability to include functionality and usability in such releases that address certain customer requirements with which we have limited prior experience and operating history. Some of these new product and service offerings could subject us to increased risk of legal liability related to the provision of services as well as cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. For example, with our introduction of on-demand or cloud-based services and subscription-based licensing models, we are entering markets that are not yet fully mature. Market acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including security, reliability, performance, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers in the U.S. or internationally. Additionally, customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. To the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance of such products or services, our business could be harmed. From time to time we open source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology, license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis, and release selected technology for industry standardization. These changes may have negative revenue implications and make it easier for our competitors to produce products or services similar to ours. If we are unable to respond to these competitive threats, our business could be harmed.We are also devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, including cloud-based computing and mobile and non-PC device markets. These new offerings and markets require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Many of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper experience in the cloud-based computing and mobile and non-PC device markets, and greater sales, consulting and marketing resources. In the mobile and non-PC device markets, our intent is to partner with device makers, chipset and OS vendors, manufacturers and telecommunications carriers to embed our technology on their platforms. If we are unable to successfully enter into strategic alliances with device makers, manufacturers or telecommunication carriers, or if they are not as productive as we anticipate, our market penetration may not proceed as rapidly as we anticipate and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. The increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business. To accelerate the growth of our business, in November 2011, we announced a strategy to offer subscriptions to certain of our products as part of our Creative Cloud offering. As a result, we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. This subscription model will alter the way we price and deliver our products. These changes reflect a partial shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. If our customers' purchases trend away from perpetual licenses toward subscriptions, we will experience a deferral of revenues and cash received from customers. This cloud strategy will require continued investment in product development and cloud operations, and may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:•if new or current customers desire only perpetual licenses, we may not be successful in selling subscriptions;•although we intend to support our perpetual license business, the increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may raise concerns among our installed customer base;•we may be unsuccessful in achieving our target pricing;•our revenues might decline over the short or long term as a result of this strategy;•our relationships with existing partners that resell perpetual licenses may be damaged; and•we may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we expand our cloud operations.Revenue from our product and service offerings may be difficult to predict.As previously discussed, we are devoting significant resources to the development of product and service offerings as well as new distribution models where we have a limited operating history. The addition of a subscription licensing model to augment 36Table of Contentsour traditional perpetual licensing model may cause license revenue to decline more quickly than anticipated. Under a subscription model, downturns or upturns in sales are not be immediately reflected in our results of operations. Subscription pricing allows customers to use our products at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license. Although the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable, it creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows.As a result, the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our results of operations might not reflect such downturns until future periods. A subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues from subscription- or SaaS-based services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could make our revenue less predictable, including longer than expected sales and implementation cycles, decisions to open source certain of our technology initiatives, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternate licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. The SaaS business model we utilize in our Digital Marketing business unit typically involves selling services on a subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide for shorter or longer terms. Although many of our service and subscription agreements contain automatic renewal terms, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew. We cannot provide assurance that these subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. We cannot be assured that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels, or declines in consumer internet activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on less favorable terms to us, our revenues may decline.Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including our customers' satisfaction with our services, the prices of our services and general economic conditions. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows might decline.Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions. Uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners, makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in the U.S. and other countries slows or does not improve, or if the U.S. or other countries in which we do business experience further economic recessions or sovereign debt crises, or if current economic conditions in Europe do not improve or deteriorate further, many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.  Financial institutions may continue to consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. A disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on 37Table of Contentswhich we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Political instability in any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.We have in the past and may in the future acquire additional companies, products or technologies. Recently, we acquired Omniture in October 2009, Day in October 2010, a number of smaller business combinations and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2011 and Efficient Frontier in January 2012, as well as other smaller business acquisitions. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:•difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;•difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;•entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;•difficulty integrating the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;•inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;•inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;•inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;•inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities;•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;•potential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•potential impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;•potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including but not limited to, issues with the acquired company’s intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security, privacy practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements impacting the acquired business;•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;•incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;•potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective;•potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions; 38Table of Contents•potential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and•potential incompatibility of business cultures.Mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. We may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products. Any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business.We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from third-party infringers or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.Although we defend our intellectual property rights and combat unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. We actively pursue software piracy as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities increase, it may further harm our business.Additionally, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach or attack, or otherwise, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights.Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability.We are transitioning to new business models that are more highly regulated for privacy and data security. We are also expanding these new models in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the U.S. With this transition, our liability exposure, compliance requirements and costs associated with privacy issues will likely increase.  Privacy laws globally are changing and evolving.  Governments are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store or transmit personal data. New laws may come into effect that would require us to obtain explicit consent to collect or use a broad range of customer data. This requirement may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our products and services are being used, and to implement our new business models effectively. These new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors.  Any perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, reputational harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.On behalf of certain of our customers using some of our services, we collect and store information derived from the activities of website visitors, which may include anonymous and/or personal information. This enables us to provide such customers with reports on aggregated anonymous or personal information from and about the visitors to their websites in the manner specifically directed by each such individual customer. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information.  Our compliance with privacy laws and 39Table of Contentsregulations and our reputation among the public body of website visitors depend on such customers' adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with such visitors' expectations. We also rely on representations made to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information we provide to them via our services do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. We ask customers to represent to us that they provide their website visitors the opportunity to “opt-out” of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. We do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these representations are false or if such customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face potentially adverse publicity and possible legal or other regulatory action.  In addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as Adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increased liability.Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that are designed to attack our products and systems, including our internal network. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers' data. These potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Although these are industry-wide problems that affect computers and products across all platforms, they affect our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of our applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, deploying security updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may lead to claims against us and harm our reputation, and could lead some customers to seek to return products, to stop using certain services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also increase their expenditures on security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenues. Some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.Some of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, our hosted Digital Media offerings and the Digital Marketing business unit, rely on services hosted and controlled directly by us or by third parties. Because we hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities, a security incident may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data, or customer data may be exposed to unauthorized access. Unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through break-ins, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers. While our products and services provide and support strong password controls, IP restriction and account controls, their use is controlled by the customer. As such, this could allow accounts to be created with weak passwords, which could result in allowing an attacker to gain access to customer data. Additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer employees. If there were ever an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage on behalf of our customers, it is possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the 40Table of Contentsfailure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses may harm our systems causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation. We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in consumer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. We may be liable to our customers for damages they may incur resulting from these events, such as loss of business, loss of future revenues, breach of contract or for the loss of goodwill to their business. In addition to potential liability, if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers.Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from one distributor, Ingram Micro, Inc., which represented 14% of our net revenue for fiscal 2011. We have multiple non-exclusive, independently negotiated distribution agreements with Ingram Micro and its subsidiaries covering our arrangements in specified countries and regions. Each of these contracts has an independent duration, is independent of any other agreement (such as a master distribution agreement) and any termination of one agreement does not affect the status of any of the other agreements. In fiscal 2011, no single agreement with this distributor was responsible for over 5% of our total net revenue. If any one of our agreements with this distributor were terminated, we believe we could make arrangements with new or existing distributors to distribute our products without a substantial disruption to our business; however, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative short-term impact on our results of operations.Successfully managing our indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business. Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face potential legal risk and reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, corruption and anti-competitive behavior. Although we have undertaken efforts to reduce these third-party risks, they remain present. We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products effectively. If our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. Our distributors also sell our competitors' products, and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. We also distribute some products through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in current economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could further negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to timely secure replacement distributors.We also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel include a longer sales cycle associated with direct sales efforts, difficulty in hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover new and upgraded products and services. Moreover, our recent hires and sales personnel added through our recent business acquisitions may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. Our business could be seriously harmed if these expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenues and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our relationships and future ability to sell to certain of these accounts covered by such employees.We also provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of governmental entities, both domestically and internationally. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to governmental entities include longer sales cycles associated with selling to diverse governmental entities, varying governmental budgeting processes and timelines and adherence to potentially complex specific procurement regulations and other requirements. Ineffectively managing these risks could result in the potential assessment of penalties and fines, harm to our reputation and lost sales opportunities to such governmental entities. We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, 41Table of Contentsbut also presents risks to our business, including the possibilities that we may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide as directly as we would be able to do in our own company-run call centers, and that our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed and our revenue may be adversely affected.Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is near major earthquake faults. We have developed certain disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.Net revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.The market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including shortfalls in our net revenue, margins, earnings or key performance metrics, changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, the announcement of new products, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors, seasonal variations in the demand for our products and services and the implementation cycles for our new customers, the loss of a large customer or our inability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations and developments in our industry, as well as unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory, political or market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, records management, employee data privacy, corporate governance,  employee and third-party complaints, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in U.S. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our internal policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business.As a global business that generates approximately 50% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:•foreign currency fluctuations;•changes in government preferences for software procurement;•international economic, political and labor conditions;42Table of Contents•tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;•failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;•inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;•delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;•transportation delays;•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and•other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.In addition, approximately 45% of our employees are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. We also intend to continue expansion of our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. Expansion in international markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenues may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer. We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the judgment factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We have issued $1.5 billion of notes in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also have a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. Although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things: •requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.Our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the 43Table of Contentsinterest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing. Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States of  America (“GAAP”). These  principles are  subject to interpretation  by the SEC and  various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. For example, the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow GAAP under SEC regulations and those who are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) outside of the U.S. These efforts by the FASB and IASB may result in different accounting principles under GAAP that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting.If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, resulting in an impact on our results of operations. Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2008 and 2009 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel our business may be harmed.Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of our senior management. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. We have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining such highly skilled personnel. Accounting regulations requiring the expensing of equity compensation may impair our ability to 44Table of Contentsprovide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions with regards to our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation and teamwork. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with our previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and otherwise adversely affect our future success.Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2011 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements, municipal securities, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of December 2, 2011, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.ITEM 1B
