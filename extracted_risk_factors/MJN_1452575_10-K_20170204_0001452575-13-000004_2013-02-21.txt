Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS.         In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results, which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline.Risks Relating to Our BusinessOur success depends on sustaining the strength of our brands, particularly our Enfa family of brands.        The Enfa family of brands accounts for a significant portion of our net sales.  The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends upon our ability to offer attractive brand value propositions.  This in turn depends in part on consumers attributing a higher value to our products than to alternatives.  If the difference in the value attributed to our products as compared to those of our competitors narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, consumers may choose not to buy our products.  If we fail to promote and maintain the brand equity of our products across each of our markets, then consumer perception of our products’ nutritional quality may be diminished and our business could be materially adversely affected.  Our ability to maintain or improve our value propositions will impact whether these circumstances will result in decreased market share and profitability.We may experience liabilities or negative effects on our reputation as a result of real or perceived quality issues, including product recalls, injuries or other claims.         Whether real or perceived, contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product mislabeling or product tampering could result in our recall of products.  From time to time we have experienced recalls of our products.  While such recalls have not been material to our business on a global level in the past, we cannot assure you that such material product recalls will not occur in the future.  We may also be subject to liability if our products or operations violate or are alleged to violate applicable laws or regulations or in the event our products cause, or are alleged to cause, injury, illness or death.        Powder milk products are not sterile.  Because the possibility of environmental contamination exists, we conduct numerous quality checks during production to confirm that our products are free of contaminants when they leave our facilities.  Furthermore, a substantial portion of our products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration.  Depending on the specific type of product, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw food materials, the processing and packaging of food products and upon use and handling by health care professionals, hospital personnel and consumers.  In the event that certain of our products are found, or are alleged, to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not such products were under our control, our brand reputation and business could be materially adversely affected.        Whether real or perceived, reports or allegations of inadequate product quality control with respect to our products or those of other manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products could adversely impact our sales.  Such reports or allegations could contribute to a perceived safety risk for our products or for pediatric nutrition products generally and adversely impact our sales or otherwise disrupt our business.  10Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the Internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms and social media sites.  For example, unfounded media reports in late 2011 alleging cronobacter contamination of one of our products in the United States resulted in several retailers temporarily removing such product from their store shelves.  Such actions, whether or not justified, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, brand image and results of operations.  Moreover, federal, state and local governments and municipalities could propose or pass legislation banning the use of such products.  Events such as these may create a perception of contamination risk among consumers with respect to all products in our industry.        In addition, we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under foreign laws and U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states.  A significant product liability or other legal claim or judgment against us or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our profitability.  Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or is not merited or fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could materially adversely affect our reputation and brand image and therefore our business.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations.  Changes in governmental regulations could harm our business.        As a producer of pediatric nutrition products, our activities are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities and international organizations, including rules and regulations with respect to the environment, employee health and safety, hygiene, quality control, advertising and tax laws.  It can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant product processes.  Our activities may also be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and increasingly dictating the specific content of our products and limiting information and advertising about the benefits of products that we market.  In addition, public policy changes or decisions that restrict the marketing, promotion and availability of our products, continued access to health care professionals, the ability to include genetically modified organisms in our products, as well as the manufacture and labeling of our products, could materially adversely affect our business.  For example, regulations in the Philippines require governmental review of all advertisements for products intended for children under the age of two.  In addition, certain advocates, along with governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations, have lobbied against the marketing and sale of some pediatric nutrition products.  These efforts could result in increased governmental restrictions on our activities in the future.  Our activities could be materially adversely affected by any significant changes in such policies or their enforcement.  Our ability to anticipate and comply with changing global standards requires significant investment in monitoring the global external environment and we may be unable to comply with changes in policies restricting our ability to continue to operate our business or manufacture, market or sell our products.Commodity price increases will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability.        Our business is particularly vulnerable to commodity price increases.  Commodity prices impact our business directly through the cost of raw materials used to make our products (such as skim milk powder, whole milk powder, lactose and whey protein concentrate), the cost of inputs used to manufacture and ship our products (such as crude oil and energy) and the amount we pay to produce or purchase packaging for our products (such as cans, pouches, cardboard and plastic).  Commodities such as these are susceptible to price volatility caused by conditions outside of our control, including fluctuations in commodities markets, currency fluctuations, availability of supply, weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs.  Dairy costs are the largest component of our cost of goods sold.  Increases in the price of dairy and other raw materials would negatively impact our gross margins if we were unable to offset such increases through increases in our selling price, changes in product mix or cost reduction/productivity enhancement efforts.  The prices of these materials may continue to rise due to a general increase in commodities prices, especially for agricultural products.  This would in turn affect the unit costs of products sold for our pediatric nutrition products.  Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, continued volatility in the prices of commodities we purchase could increase the costs of our products and we may experience lower profitability and be unable to maintain historical levels of productivity.  Furthermore, increases in our selling prices imposed to offset increases in commodity prices could result in lower sales volume; as such, we may be unable to offset increased commodity costs with price increases if such price increases were to weaken demand for our product.          We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize commodity price volatility.  Generally, these techniques include incorporating clauses setting forth unit pricing that is based on an average commodity price over a corresponding period of time.  If we fail to manage our commodity price exposure adequately, our business may be materially adversely affected.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets.         The pediatric nutrition industry is intensely competitive.  Our primary competitors, including Abbott Laboratories, Danone and Nestlé S.A., have substantial financial, marketing and other resources.  We compete against large global companies, as well as regional and local companies, in each of the regions in which we operate.  In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label, store and economy brand products that are generally sold at lower prices.  Competition in our product categories is based on the following factors:11•    brand recognition and loyalty;  •    product quality;  •    effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences;  •    product innovation;  •    price; and  •    distribution and availability of products.        From time to time, in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share, we may need to improve our brand recognition and product value proposition, and increase our spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation.  The success of marketing, advertising and new product innovation is subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance.  We may also need to reduce prices for some of our products in order to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share.  Market share losses could also lead to higher than necessary inventory levels held by our customers.  Competitive and customer pressures, as well as price controls, may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases.  Our business will suffer if profit margins decrease, either as a result of a reduction in prices or an increase in costs with an inability to increase prices proportionally.Economic downturns could cause consumers to shift their purchases from our higher-priced premium products to lower-priced products, which could materially adversely affect our business.         The willingness of consumers to purchase premium brand pediatric nutrition products depends in part on local economic conditions.  In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may shift their purchases from our higher-priced premium products to lower-priced products or delay having children.Volatility in the financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flow and financial flexibility, as well as the demand for our products.        Volatility in the financial markets could adversely affect economic activity and credit markets in the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business.  This could have an adverse impact on our customers, distributors, suppliers, counterparties to certain financial instruments, financial service providers and other service providers.Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure that could materially negatively impact our operating results.        We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar,  the Mexican peso, the euro, the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringitt, the Thai baht and the Canadian dollar.  Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars at the then-applicable exchange rates.  Consequently, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.  While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments.The global nature of our business subjects us to additional business risks that could cause our sales and profitability to decline.        We operate our business and market our products internationally in more than 50 countries.  For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, 75%, 72%, and 68%, respectively, of our net sales were generated in countries outside of the United States.  The risks associated with our operations outside of the United States include:•multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market or sell our products; •inflation, recession, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates and discriminatory fiscal policies; •adverse tax consequences from the repatriation of cash;•trade protection measures, including increased duties and taxes, and import or export licensing requirements; 12 •price controls; •government health promotional programs intended to discourage the use of our products;  •differing local product preferences and product requirements;  •difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; •differing labor regulations;•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; •political and economic instability; •enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions; •changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; and •diminished protection of intellectual property.        These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our global operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries, and special risks associated with doing business in corrupt environments.          We operate our business and market our products internationally in more than 50 countries, and we are focusing on increasing our sales and operations in regions, including Asia, Latin America, India and Russia, which are less developed, have less stability in legal systems and financial markets, and are potentially more corrupt business environments than the United States, and therefore present greater political, economic and operational risks.  We have in place policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of employees with regard to business ethics and many key legal requirements, such as applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantages; however, there can be no assurance that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, or other legal requirements.  If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.  If we believe or have reason to believe that our employees have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, or other laws or regulations, we investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances.  If violations are found or suspected, we could face civil and criminal penalties, and significant costs for investigations, litigation, fees, settlements and judgments, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, some of our competitors may not be subject to the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws.Our China operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.         A significant portion of our revenue and profit is derived from sales in China.  Consequently, our overall financial results are dependent on this market, and our business is exposed to risks there.  These risks include changes in economic conditions (including wage and commodity inflation, consumer spending and unemployment levels), tax rates and laws and consumer preferences, as well as changes in the regulatory environment and increased competition.  In addition, the translation into U.S. dollars of our results of operations in China and the value of our Chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.        Furthermore, any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.-China relations could adversely affect our China business.  Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China.  There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China.  If we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in China, our business could be materially adversely impacted.13Sales of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences, and our success depends upon our ability to predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and to develop, offer and communicate the benefits of new products rapidly enough to meet those changes.        Our success depends on our ability to define the benefits of our products and to effectively communicate these benefits in the current regulatory environment.  Our success also depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary habits and nutritional needs of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences.  If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.  If we are unable to predict accurately which shifts in consumer preferences will be long lasting, or to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline.  In addition, given the variety of cultures and backgrounds of consumers in our global consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences.  As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across our product categories.The consolidation of our retail customers and their reduction of inventory levels may put pressures on our profitability.        Our retail customers, such as mass merchandisers, club stores, grocery stores, drug stores and convenience stores, have consolidated in recent years.  This consolidation has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power, which are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, resisting price increases and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products.  In addition to reducing their inventory levels, these customers may use shelf space currently used for our products for their private label or store brand products.  Meeting demands from these customers may adversely affect our margins and, if we fail to effectively respond to these demands, our sales could decline, each of which could materially adversely affect our profitability.We rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services in connection with the manufacturing and distribution of our products.        Unaffiliated third-party suppliers provide us with materials necessary for commercial production of our products, including certain key raw materials and primary packaging materials (such as cans).  In particular, Royal DSM N.V. (“DSM”) (which acquired Martek Biosciences Corporation) provides us with most of the supply of DHA and ARA that we use in our products.  We may be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner, or at all, if any of our third-party suppliers, including DSM, should cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply us or if the supply agreements are suspended, terminated or otherwise expire without renewal.  If these suppliers are not able to supply us with the quantities of materials we need or if these suppliers are not able to provide services in the required time period, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also utilize third parties in several countries throughout the world to distribute our products.  If any of our third-party distributors fail to distribute our products in a timely manner, or at all, or if our distribution agreements are suspended, terminated or otherwise expire without renewal, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we or one of our suppliers should encounter problems manufacturing products, our business could suffer.        The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, in part due to strict regulatory requirements.  Problems may arise during the manufacturing process for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, maintenance of our manufacturing environment, natural disasters, various contagious diseases and process safety issues.  If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded.  This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, time and expenses being spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products.  If problems are not discovered before the affected product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs as well as reputational damage may also be incurred.  To the extent that we or one of our suppliers experience significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.We may experience difficulties and delays inherent in the manufacturing and selling of our products.        We may experience difficulties and delays inherent in the manufacturing and selling of our products, such as: (1) seizure or recalls of products and raw materials or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (2) the failure to obtain, the imposition of limitations on the use of, or loss of, patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights; (3) our failure, or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers, to comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; (4) construction delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our products; (5) other manufacturing or distribution problems, including changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capability due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply; (6) availability of raw materials; and (7) restrictions associated with the transportation of raw materials or goods in and out of foreign countries.14If we fail to increase our production and manufacturing capacity, we will be unable to continue to grow and our ability to produce new products, expand within our existing markets and enter into new markets will be limited.        Global growth and demand for our products has increased the utilization of our production and manufacturing facilities, including manufacturing capacity provided by third-party manufacturers and packaging capacity with respect to our products.  If we are unable to successfully expand our production and manufacturing capacity, we will be unable to continue our growth and expand within our existing markets or enter into additional geographic markets or new product categories.  In addition, failure to successfully expand our production and manufacturing capacity will limit our ability to introduce and distribute new products, including our existing pipeline of innovations and product improvements, or otherwise take advantage of opportunities in new and existing markets.  Further, increasing our production and manufacturing facilities requires significant investment and time to build.  Delays in increasing capacity could also limit our ability to continue our growth and materially adversely affect our business.Disruption of our global supply chain could materially adversely affect our business.        Our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, strikes, various contagious diseases or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in WIC, or our participation in it, could materially adversely affect our business.        Participation in WIC involves a competitive bidding process and is an important part of our U.S. business based on the volume of infant formula sold under the program.  As of December 31, 2012, we held the contracts that supply approximately 39% of WIC births in the United States.  As a result, our business strategy includes bidding for new WIC contracts and maintaining current WIC relationships.  Our failure to win bids for new contracts pursuant to the WIC program or our inability to maintain current WIC relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, any changes to how the WIC program is administered and any changes to the eligibility requirements and/or overall participation in the WIC program could also have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be harmed by a failure of our information technology, administrative or outsourcing systems.        We rely on our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes.  Difficulties or failure to implement our information technology initiatives by us or our service providers or the failure of our information technology, administrative or outsourcing systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business to suffer.  In addition, our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses.  Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees, invoicing and receiving payments from our customers or performing other information technology, administrative or outsourcing services on a timely basis.Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.        Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.  While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats.  Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.We may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience or as we expand our operations into new product categories.        We intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to enter into new markets.  This may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate.  It may involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems.  We also intend to expand our product portfolio by adding new product categories.  As we expand our business into new countries or product categories we may encounter regulatory, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to start up our operations or become profitable in such 15countries or product categories.  This may affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and regulators and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success.        Our ability to develop new pediatric nutrition products depends on, among other factors, our ability to understand the composition and variation of breast milk.  Analyzing breast milk requires significant investment in research and development and testing of new ingredients and new production processes.  We devote significant resources to investment in research and development in order gain a deep understanding of the composite ingredients of breast milk, as well as the optimal nutritional requirements of infants and children.  The research and development process is expensive, prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.  Development of a new product, from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch, typically takes between five and seven years, but may require an even longer timeline.  Each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country.  Because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with research and development, products that we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market such products successfully.  In addition, new regulations or changes to existing regulations may have a negative effect on innovations in our pipeline, especially late-stage pipeline products.  The development of new products may take longer and cost more to develop and may be less successful than we currently anticipate as a result of:•products that may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal time frame, or fail to ever reach market, for any number of reasons, including efficacy and the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture;  •failure to enter into or successfully implement optimal alliances where appropriate for the discovery and commercialization of products, or otherwise to maintain a consistent scope and variety of promising late-stage pipeline products; •failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain commercial viability; or•changing and increasing obstacles to achieving regulatory approval in key markets.        We cannot assure you that any of our products currently in our development pipeline will be commercially successful.We could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to address violations of, or liabilities under, these requirements.        Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Among other things, these requirements regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the use, management, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, the control of combustible dust, the reduction of noise emissions and fire and explosion risks, the cleanup of contamination and the prevention of workplace exposures and injuries.  Pollution controls and various permits and programs are required for many of our operations.  We could incur or be subject to, among other things, substantial costs (including civil or criminal fines or penalties or clean-up costs), third party damage claims, requirements to install additional pollution control or safety control equipment and/or permit revocations in the event of violations by us of environmental, health, and safety requirements applicable to our facilities and operations or our failure to obtain, develop or comply with required environmental permits or programs.        In addition, most of our facilities have a history of production operations in the food and drug industry, and some substances used in such production require proper controls in their storage and disposal.  We have been named as a “potentially responsible party,” or are involved in investigation and remediation, at two third party disposal sites.  We can be held responsible, in some cases without regard to knowledge, fault, or ownership at the time of the release, for the costs of investigating or remediating contamination of any real property we or our predecessors ever owned, operated, or used as a waste disposal site.  In addition, we can be required to compensate public authorities or private owners for damages to natural resources or other real property, or to restore those properties, in the event of off-site migration of contamination.  Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could also cause us to incur additional or unexpected costs to achieve or maintain compliance.  The assertion of claims relating to on- or off-site contamination, the discovery of previously unknown environmental liabilities or the imposition of unanticipated investigation or cleanup obligations, could result in potentially significant expenditures to address contamination or resolve claims or liabilities.  Such costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.        Given the importance of brand recognition to our business, we have invested considerable effort in seeking trademark protection for our brands, including the Enfa family of brands.  However, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights in our brands adequately or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights.  We also cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our brands will be sufficient to discourage or eliminate counterfeiting of our 16products.  Our trademark registrations and applications can potentially be challenged and canceled or narrowed.  Moreover, some of the countries in which we operate offer less protection for these rights, and may subject these rights to higher risks, than is the case in Europe or North America.  In addition, it is costly to litigate in order to protect any of our intellectual property rights.  If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating these rights in our core products or brands, including our Enfa family of brands, our future financial condition and our ability to develop our business could be materially adversely affected.        Other companies have from time to time taken, and may in the future take, actions that we believe violate our intellectual property rights and we may decide to enforce (and in some cases are currently enforcing) those rights against such actions.  Uncertainties inherent in such litigation make the outcome and associated costs difficult to predict.  If unsuccessful, the legal actions could result in the invalidation of some of our intellectual property rights, which could materially adversely affect our business.        We rely on a combination of security measures, confidentiality policies, contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary formulae and other valuable trade secrets.  We also rely on patent, copyright and trademark laws to further protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot, however, be certain that the steps we take will prevent the development and marketing of similar, competing products and services by third parties.  Our existing patents and any future patents that we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar products or to provide us with a competitive advantage.  Moreover, our patents can potentially be challenged and narrowed or invalidated.  Trade secrets are difficult to protect, and despite our efforts may become known to competitors or independently discovered.  The confidentiality agreements we rely on with our employees, customers, contractors and others may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach.  Failure to adequately protect our valuable intellectual property from being infringed or misappropriated could materially adversely affect our business.We may be required to defend ourselves against intellectual property claims from third parties, which could harm our business.        Regardless of merit, there are third-party patents that may cover our products.  Third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents.  If a third party asserts that our products or services are infringing upon its intellectual property, these claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages and/or prevent us from selling our products.  Even if we were to prevail against such claims, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.  Furthermore, as a result of an intellectual property challenge, we may find it necessary to enter into royalty licenses or other costly agreements, and we may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us.Our sales and marketing practices may be challenged by consumers and competitors, which could harm our business.        We participate in a variety of marketing activities, including print and television advertising, direct mail, online/internet and promotional programs.  We work with external agencies to create strong marketing campaigns for health care professionals, retail sales organizations and consumers.  Although our marketing is evidence-based and emphasizes our superior nutritional science, consumers and competitors may challenge, and have challenged, certain of our practices by claiming, among other things, false and misleading advertising with respect to advertising for certain of our products.  Such challenges could result in our having to pay monetary damages or limit our ability to maintain current sales and marketing practices.        Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of such potential lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against us, we do not believe any currently pending legal proceeding to which we are a party would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, although an unfavorable outcome in excess of amounts recognized as of December 31, 2012, with respect to one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which a loss would be recognized.Increases in costs of current and post-retirement benefits may reduce our profitability.        Our profitability may be affected by increases in costs of current and post-retirement medical and other employee benefits, particularly within the United States.  These costs can vary substantially as a result of changes in both health care costs and health care regulation, volatility in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate related liabilities.  These factors may put upward pressure on the cost of providing medical and other benefits.  We can provide no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and upward pressure would reduce our profitability.Labor disputes may cause work stoppages, strikes and disruptions.        Our manufacturing workforces in Zeeland, Michigan; Evansville, Indiana; Guangzhou, China; and Chonburi, Thailand are not unionized.  The manufacturing workforces in Delicias, Mexico, and São Paulo, Brazil, are unionized and covered by collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated annually.  The manufacturing workforce and non-supervised sales force in Makati, Philippines, are unionized and covered by a three-year collective bargaining agreement, which was renewed in December 2010.  In addition, European Works Councils 17represent the manufacturing workforce in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and the commercial organizations in France and Spain.  As a result, any labor disputes, including work stoppages, strikes and disruptions, could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified people in a competitive environment.        Our business strategy and future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire and retain, in a competitive environment, highly-skilled and diverse leaders, managers and professionals who are critical to our business functions and growth strategy.  The market for highly-skilled employees is competitive in the labor markets in which we operate.  Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees or recruit qualified personnel in a timely fashion, or if we are required to incur unexpected increases in compensation costs to retain key employees or meet our hiring goals.  If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel that we require, or we are not able to do so on a cost-effective basis, it could be more difficult for us to sell and develop our products and services and execute our business strategy.We derive a significant percentage of our sales from two customers.  The loss of either of these customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.        Our products are sold principally to the wholesale and retail trade, both nationally and internationally, and sales to two customers, DKSH International Ltd. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.  If either of these customers ceases doing business with us or if we encounter any difficulties in our relationship with either of them, our business could be materially adversely affected.An adverse change in favorable demographic and economic trends as well as a change in scientific opinion regarding our products in any of our largest markets could materially adversely affect our business and reduce our profitability.        Our growth plan relies on favorable demographic and economic trends in various markets, including: (1) rising incomes in emerging markets, (2) increasing number of working mothers and (3) increasing consumer global awareness of the importance of pediatric nutrition on wellness and health outcomes.  If these demographic trends change in an adverse way, our business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, an adverse change in scientific opinion regarding our products, such as the health benefits of DHA and ARA, or a continued decline in birth rates could materially adversely affect our business.We have substantial debt, which could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.        We had total indebtedness of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2012. See “Item 8. Financial Statements – Note 15. Debt” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Short-Term Borrowings and – Long-Term Debt.”        This amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt; •requiring us to repay the full amount of our debt upon a change of control triggering event; •making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; •increasing the risk of future credit rating downgrades of our debt, which could increase future debt costs; •increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; •reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; •placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as leveraged as we are; •limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; and •limiting our ability to pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.         To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above could increase.  In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected.  Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it 18becomes due and we could incur substantial cost if we need to repatriate cash to the United States in order to repay such debt.  Further, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.        In order to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, we have in the past entered into and exited interest rate swap agreements.  Developing an effective strategy for dealing with risks from movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations.  In addition, we are exposed to counter-party credit risk for nonperformance and, in the event of nonperformance, to market risk for changes in interest rates.  Finally, our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations.  As a result, our economic hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  Further discussion of our hedging of interest rate risk is included in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We could evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives, any of which could distract our management or otherwise have a negative effect on our sales, costs and stock price.        Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy or obtain rights to other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities.  We could evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic initiatives, alliances, vertical integration opportunities and divestitures.  If we attempt to engage in these transactions, we expose ourselves to various inherent risks, including:•accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;  •the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired or combined business;  •our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;  •difficulties successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly-acquired operations or employees;  •difficulties maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  •unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business;  •the potential discovery of latent unethical business practices;  •the possibility we could incur impairment charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and  •the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or implement the strategic initiative.        If any of the foregoing risks materializes, our results of operations and the results of the proposed transactions would likely differ from ours, and market expectations, and our stock price could, accordingly, decline.  In addition, we may not be able to complete desirable transactions for various reasons. We depend on cash flows generated by our subsidiaries, and a failure to receive distributions from our subsidiaries may result in our inability to meet our financial obligations, or to pay dividends.        We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries and certain intellectual property.  Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property.  Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise.  There are a number of other factors that could affect our ability to pay dividends, including the following:•lack of availability of cash to pay dividends due to changes in our operating cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, working capital requirements and other cash needs;  •unexpected or increased operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof;  •restrictions under Delaware law or other applicable law on the amount of dividends that we may pay;  19•a decision by our board of directors to modify or revoke its policy to pay dividends; and  •the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.        Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and its ability to make any payments will depend on its earnings, the terms of its indebtedness and legal restrictions.  Under certain circumstances, legal restrictions may limit or delay our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us in the future.  In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations.Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Former ParentIf our split-off from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”) fails to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, we may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify BMS for any resulting taxes and related expenses, and we believe that the payment if required could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In connection with our split-off from BMS on December 23, 2009, BMS and its counsel have relied on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from us, as well as certain covenants by us regarding the future conduct of our business and other matters, the incorrectness or violation of which could affect the qualification for non-recognition of gain and loss of our split-off from BMS.  As a result, BMS and we agreed to certain tax-related indemnities set forth in the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement referred to herein.  We agreed, generally, to indemnify BMS for taxes and certain related expenses resulting from the failure of our split-off from BMS to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss to the extent attributable to (i) the failure of any of our representations to be true or the breach by us of any of our covenants, (ii) the application of Section 355(e) or Section 355(f) of the Internal Revenue Code to any acquisition of our stock or assets or any of our affiliates or (iii) certain other acts or omissions by us or our affiliates.  To the extent we become obligated to make an indemnification payment under the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement, we believe that the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Common StockOur failure to successfully execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.        Our continued success in part depends on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy.  We intend to grow our business profitably through several strategic initiatives, including geographic and category expansion and productivity savings.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our strategic plan.  If we fail to fully implement any material part of our strategic initiatives, or if we achieve these initiatives and they fail to yield the expected benefits, there could be an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Any such adverse effect on our business and results of operations could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may result in an entrenchment of management and diminish the value of our common stock.        Several provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management.  In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable.        These provisions include:•authorizing our board of directors to issue “blank check” preferred shares without stockholder approval;  •prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;  •prohibiting shareholder action by written consent;  •limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and  •establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.20        Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder.        These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of our common stockholders to benefit from a change of control and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.
