  General        

        Whole Foods Market is the world's leading natural and organic foods supermarket and America's first national "Certified Organic" grocer. Our Company mission is to
promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the health of our bodies are
directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, food safety concerns, and the sustainability of our entire
ecosystem. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over
the last 27 years. 

        Whole
Foods Market, Inc. is a Texas corporation incorporated in 1980. The Company is based in Austin, Texas and conducts business through various wholly owned subsidiaries. Unless
otherwise specified, references to Whole Foods Market or the Company in this Report include its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. 

        We
opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and completed our initial public offering in January 1992. As of September 30, 2007, we operated 276 stores organized
into 11 geographic operating regions, each with its own leadership team: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. This
includes 74 stores (net of divested locations) acquired from Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats") on August 28, 2007: 70 stores in 22 U.S. states and four stores in Canada. Unless
otherwise noted, all information in Part I of this Form 10-K is adjusted to include this acquisition. 


        Our
sales have grown rapidly through new store openings, acquisitions and comparable store sales growth, from approximately $92 million in fiscal year 1991, excluding the effect
of pooling-of-interests transactions completed since 1991, to approximately $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2007, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 30%. We
are a Fortune 500 company, ranking number 411 based on our fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately $5.6 billion. Our 276 stores average approximately 34,000 square feet in size, approximately
$32 million in annual sales, and are approximately 8.2 years old. Excluding Wild Oats, our stores average 37,000 square feet in size, approximately $33 million in annual sales,
and are approximately 7.9 years old. Our stores are supported by 11 regional offices and our Austin headquarters, regional distribution centers, bakehouse facilities, commissary kitchens,
seafood-processing facilities, produce procurement centers, a national meat purchasing office, a confectionary, and a specialty coffee, tea procurement and brewing operation.

        We
aspire to become an international brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but also with being the best food retailer in every community in which we are located. We
believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products is helping us reach that goal, differentiating our stores from conventional supermarkets and enabling us to attract a broader customer base.
Perishable product sales accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. We believe that all shoppers, not just natural and organic food
shoppers, appreciate great produce, dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods, and it is our strength of execution in perishables along with our unparalleled customer service that has attracted
many of our most loyal customers. 

<A
NAME="ca77202_the_natural_and_organic_products_industry"> 
 
The Natural and Organic Products Industry        

        According to a leading trade publication for the industry, sales of natural products across all retail and direct-to-consumer channels
grew to approximately $57 billion in 2006, a 10% increase over the prior year. The natural and organic products we offer in our stores include food and beverages, dietary supplements, personal
care products, household goods, organic cotton clothing, and related educational products. We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors, including: 



•heightened
awareness of the role that food and nutrition play in long-term health, which has led to healthier eating patterns;
•a
better-educated and wealthier populace whose median age is increasing each year;
•increasing
consumer concern over the purity and safety of food due to the presence of pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and other chemicals, and
genetically engineered ingredients; and
•environmental
concerns due to the degradation of water and soil quality. 


        Natural
foods can be defined as foods that are minimally processed, largely or completely free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other non-naturally occurring
chemicals and as near to their whole, natural state as possible. Organic products are grown through methods intended to support and enhance the earth's natural balance. Generally, organic food
products are produced using: 



•agricultural
management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health;
•no
genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides;
•livestock
management practices intended to promote healthy, humanely treated animals by providing organically grown feed, fresh air and outdoor access while using no
antibiotics or growth hormones; and
•food
processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms ("GMOs") or synthetic
preservatives.

Organic Rule  

        In October 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Organic Rule was implemented into Federal law. The Organic Rule was created to
address the rapid, consistent growth of the organics industry over the past 20-plus years and the need for a set of national organic standards to serve as clear guidelines as to what is
considered organic for the industry and its customers. Under the Organic Rule, all products labeled as "organic" in any form must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency.
Furthermore, all retailers, including Whole Foods Market, that handle, store, and sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic integrity by: 



•preventing
the commingling of organic and conventional products;
•protecting
organic products from contact with prohibited substances (such as sanitation and pest control products);
•labeling
organic products properly and clearly; and
•keeping
proper records with regard to organic handling procedures and vendor relationships. 


        Whole
Foods Market played an active leadership role in the development of the national organic standards. Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice President of Global Communications and Quality
Standards, served on the National Organic Standards Board ("NOSB") from 1995 to 2000. The NOSB members were appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to act as industry advisors to the USDA's National
Organic Program, developing the standards and protocols that form the backbone of the USDA's Organic Rule. As the sole retail representative on the NOSB, Ms. Wittenberg contributed a broad,
realistic perspective on how the standards could work most effectively at the retail level. 

        Whole
Foods Market has been devoted to protecting organic integrity for years, and we are pleased to have the USDA's Organic Rule as a guiding standard. In May 2003, Whole Foods
Market became America's first national "Certified Organic" grocer through certification from Quality Assurance International ("QAI"), a federally recognized independent third-party certification
organization. This voluntary certification tells our customers that we have gone the extra mile by not only following the USDA's Organic Rule, but following a strict set of operating procedures
designed to ensure that the products we sell and label as organic are indeed organic—procedures that are not specifically required by the Organic Rule. 

        QAI's
Organic Certification Program for Retailers verifies businesses handle organic goods according to stringent national guidelines, from receipt through re-packing to
final sale to customers. To receive certification, retailers must agree to adhere to a strict set of standards set forth by the USDA, submit documentation, and open their facilities to
on-site inspections—all designed to assure Americans that the chain of organic integrity is preserved. The certification is one more example of our commitment to the promotion
of organic agriculture and the integrity of the certified organic label.

Business Strategy        

        Whole Foods Market is the world's leading natural and organic foods supermarket. We believe that much of our success to date is because we remain a uniquely
mission-driven Company. We are highly selective about what we sell. We believe in providing an empowering work environment for our team members, and we are committed to sustainable agriculture. Our
motto, "Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet," emphasizes that our vision reaches far beyond just food retailing.

Whole Foods  

        We obtain our products locally and from all over the world, often from small, uniquely dedicated food artisans. We strive to offer the highest quality, least
processed, most flavorful and naturally preserved foods. We believe that food in its purest state, unadulterated by artificial additives, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives, is the best tasting
and most nutritious food available. 

Whole People  

        We recruit the best people we can to become part of our team. We empower them to make many operational decisions, creating a respectful workplace where team
members are treated fairly and are highly motivated to succeed. We look for team members who are passionate about food, but also well-rounded human beings who can play a critical role in
helping to build our Company into a profitable and beneficial part of every community in which we operate. 


Whole Planet  

        We believe companies, like individuals, must assume their share of responsibility for our planet. We actively support organic farming on a global basis because we
believe it is the best method for promoting sustainable agriculture and protecting the environment and farm workers. On a local basis, we are actively involved in our communities by supporting food
banks, sponsoring neighborhood events, and contributing at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to not-for-profit organizations. 

        In
October 2007, Whole Foods Market received the Green Power Partner of the Year award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") for the second consecutive year. The
award recognizes our leadership in accelerating the development of new renewable energy capacity nationwide after increasing our green power purchasing to include more than 509 million kilowatt
hours of wind-based renewable energy credits. This is enough renewable energy to offset 100 percent of the electricity used in all of our stores and facilities in the U.S. and
Canada. This was the fourth consecutive year the Company was recognized with a green power leadership award by the EPA. 

<A
NAME="ca77202_core_values"> 
 
Core Values        

        Our core values reflect what is truly important to us as an organization. They are the underpinning of our corporate culture and the soul of our Company. They
transcend our size and growth rate, so regardless of how large we become, by maintaining our core values we are able to preserve what has always been special about our Company. Our five stated core
values include: 



•selling
the highest quality natural and organic products available;
•satisfying
and delighting our customers;
•supporting
team member happiness and excellence;
•creating
wealth through profits and growth; and
•caring
about our communities and our environment. 


        These
core values speak to our belief in a balanced way of doing business. They very succinctly express the purpose of our business, which is not only to make profits, but to create
value for all of our major stakeholders—our customers, team members, suppliers, investors, and the community and environment. All are linked interdependently. In 2007, Business Ethics
magazine ranked us number 54 on its "100 Best Corporate Citizens List for 2007," a list honoring companies that excel at serving a variety of stakeholders well.

Foundations  

        In 2005, we created two independent, non-profit organizations, the Animal Compassion Foundation™ and Whole Planet Foundation™,
designed to reach our larger community stakeholders. The two private foundations were initially funded with seed money totaling over $1 million raised from two global "Five Percent Days," in
which five percent of the amount of all customer purchases at our stores was donated to the foundations. Both foundations, which are based in Austin, Texas and have their own boards of directors, are
aligned with the mission we set forth more than 25 years ago with respect to community involvement and responsibility. As we have grown and are doing more business around the world, we believe
it has become increasingly important for us to extend our vision of "community" from our backyards to the global markets in which we are trading. 

        The
Animal Compassion Foundation was established as a natural progression of our efforts to help producers evolve their practices for raising farm animals naturally and humanely.
Dedicated to improving the lives of farm animals, the Animal Compassion Foundation seeks to learn and share best practices that support the animals' needs and behaviors by supporting a worldwide
network of producers and researchers, and leading and funding on-farm research and producer workshops. More specifically, the Animal Compassion Foundation is focusing on four primary
areas: 



•providing
research money for on-farm and academic studies;
•offering
low-cost producer workshops that provide both theoretical background and practical application;
•creating
an interactive website that allows online users to access species-specific case studies, animal husbandry techniques and strategies, and links to other resources;
and
•offering
consultative services to both individual groups and producer groups. 


        The
Whole Planet Foundation's mission is to create economic partnerships with the poor in the developing-world communities that supply our stores with product. Through innovative
assistance for entrepreneurship—including direct micro-credit loans and tangible support for other community partnership projects—the Whole Planet Foundation seeks to expand
the energy and creativity of every person with whom it works in order to create wealth and prosperity in emerging economies. Micro-credit is a system pioneered by Professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of
the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The philosophy behind micro-credit is to provide the poor access to credit without requiring contracts or collateral,
enabling them to rise out of poverty through their own efforts. The Whole Planet Foundation believes micro-credit is one of the best methods to help individuals lift themselves out of poverty through
their own ingenuity. The Whole Planet Foundation is partnered with Grameen Trust in Costa Rica, Guatemala, India and soon Indonesia to support micro-lending programs in communities where the Company
sources products. The Whole Planet Foundation is also supporting micro-lending programs with other outstanding micro-finance institutions such as Adelante Foundation and Pro Mujer Nicaragua with hopes
to expand their portfolio to include other partners over time. 

7




 


        As
of September 30, 2007, the Whole Planet Foundation had committed over $5.2 million in grants to five micro-lending projects. These projects are in Costa Rica, where
Whole Foods Market sources bananas and pineapples; Guatemala and Nicaragua, where Whole Foods Market has relationships with coffee farmers; Honduras, where the Company sources bananas and buys coffee;
and India, where the Company buys tea. To date, the Whole Planet Foundation's implementing partners have supported over 14,000 micro-entrepreneurs and their families. It is estimated that each woman
with whom the foundation works in the developing world supports a family of five, which means our support is indirectly contributing to the prosperity of 70,000 individuals. Micro-entrepreneurs
supported by the Whole Planet Foundation's implementing partners are utilizing the loans for home-based businesses such as poultry and pig farming, agriculture, furniture making,
tailoring, and selling handicrafts, homemade and bakery-made foods, clothing and footwear. The Whole Planet Foundation hopes to expand its projects in 2008 to include micro-lending in
Indonesia, Kenya and Tanzania, where Whole Foods Market sources coffee through its Allegro Coffee Company.

Products        

        We offer a broad and differentiated product selection with a strong emphasis on perishable foods designed to appeal to both natural and organic foods and gourmet
shoppers. Most of our products are from natural and organic food vendors; however, we do sell certain conventional national brands that meet our quality standards. 

Quality Standards  

        An integral part of our Company mission is to promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome
foods available. We evaluate quality in terms of nutrition, freshness, appearance and taste. Our search for quality is a never-ending process involving the careful judgment of buyers throughout the
Company. 



•We
carefully evaluate each and every product that we sell.
•We
feature foods that are free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners and hydrogenated fats.
•We
are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing it with others.
•We
are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to eat.
•We
seek out and promote organically grown foods.
•We
provide food and nutritional products that support health and well-being. 


        We
monitor the production and environmental practices of our seafood suppliers and support the seafood sustainability work of the Marine Stewardship Council. From time to time, we have
stopped selling seafood species that are considered endangered by a consensus of seafood experts. 

        We
also strictly monitor how animals are raised and what they are fed. Our standards ensure the meat and poultry we sell are: 



•raised
without added growth hormones or antibiotics;
•never
fed animal by-products;
•raised
by farmers and ranchers who care about the animals and the environment in which they live; and
•closely
monitored from the farm to our stores to ensure compliance with our strict animal welfare and food safety quality standards.

Animal Welfare Standards  

        Whole Foods Market is strongly committed to helping create alternatives to the "factory farm" methods of raising livestock. We have encouraged innovative animal
production practices to improve the quality and safety of the meat and poultry sold in our stores, while also supporting humane living conditions for the animals. For this reason, we refuse to sell
commercial veal from tethered calves, foie gras from force-fed ducks and live lobsters. In February 2007, we began working with a vendor who meets our animal welfare standards, to
sell live lobsters in our Portland, Maine store. In December 2003, we started working through a consultative multi-stakeholder process to develop "Animal Compassionate" standards, farm animal
treatment standards that go above and beyond our baseline requirements for meat and poultry sold in our stores, focused on providing environments and conditions for each species that support the
animal's natural physical, emotional and behavioral well-being. In 2006, that work was then used as a basis for creating meat and poultry production standards categorized according to a
framework for continuous improvement of animal welfare on farms and ranches and to provide our customers with a clear and transparent way to make informed buying decisions based solely on animal
welfare considerations. In June 2007, we piloted a five-tiered meat and poultry labeling program at our Kensington store in London based on these standards, which we are currently
in the midst of fine-tuning and plan to roll out in the U.S. in 2008. Specific standards related to permissible and prohibited production and handling techniques from parent stock through
slaughter are intended to be included for the following species and related products: pigs, cattle, bison, broiler chickens, ducks, goats, rabbits, sheep, turkey, veal, dairy and eggs. 

Product Categories  

        Our product categories include, but are not limited to: produce, seafood, grocery, meat and poultry, bakery, prepared foods and catering, specialty (beer, wine
and cheese), Whole Body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care and educational products such as books), floral, pet products and household products. 

        Perishable
products accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. We believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products
differentiates us from conventional supermarkets and helps us attract a broader customer base. We believe that all shoppers, not just natural and organic food shoppers, appreciate great produce,
dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods. We believe it is our strength of execution in perishables that has attracted many of our most loyal customers. 

Locally Grown  

        Our history and reputation are intimately linked to our support of local farmers. For more than 27 years, we have provided our customers with the broadest
possible selection of the highest quality produce available. Our search for produce begins right outside our front door in every community where we do business. We are committed to buying from local
producers whose products meet our high quality standards, particularly those who are dedicated to environmentally friendly, sustainable agriculture. We are greatly increasing our efforts in this
regard by further empowering our individual store and regional buyers to seek out locally grown products. We value this natural diversity and have firm guidelines for using the term "local" in our
stores. For example, only produce that has traveled less than seven hours from the farm to our facility can be labeled "locally grown." 

9




 


        Whole
Foods Market currently purchases produce from over 3,000 different farms through various suppliers. Of the Company's top 10 produce suppliers, eight represent independent farms
with privately held ownership. We believe we can and should do more to support local producers. To that end, we have established a budget of up to $10 million annually to promote local
agriculture, especially animal agriculture, wherever we have stores through long-term loans at low interest rates. We completed our first loan through the Local Producer Loan Program in
February 2007 and so far have disbursed more than $1 million in loans to over 20 local producers in nine of our 11 regions. Loan recipients must use funds for expansion and not operating
expenses, meet Whole Foods Market's quality standards, and have a viable business plan and adequate cash flow to service the debt. Eligible products include agricultural crops, value-added food
products, and other all-natural grocery items. 

        In
addition, at stores in five of our 11 regions, we are now providing space in our parking lots weekly for local farmers to sell their products directly to our customers, working in
concert with existing farmers' markets when possible. Our stores have excellent locations and heavy customer traffic to help these farmers' markets flourish, and their presence at our stores provides
more local choices for our customers. 

Whole Trade™  

        On March 29, 2007, we launched our Whole Trade program, a new buying initiative that brings together a set of strict criteria for products from developing
countries to ensure: exceptional product quality; more money for producers; better wages and working conditions for workers; sound environmental production practices, and support of poverty
eradication via donating 1% of product sales to the Whole Planet Foundation. 

        The
Whole Trade program gives low-income producers entry into and stability within the global marketplace by ensuring better wages and safer working conditions for workers.
It supports equitable systems of trade that are an investment in both farms and communities. Through the Whole Trade program, Whole Foods Market seeks out and promotes foods that are grown using sound
environmental practices that encourage biodiversity and healthy soils. In addition to including some products that are grown organically, the Whole Trade program includes products that respect the
earth without formal organic certification. These products could be sourced in two ways. Some come from farms that use integrated pest management systems, emphasizing alternatives to chemical use;
they also practice soil and water conservation through composting and reforestation. Other products are respectfully harvested from land or water areas that provide shelter and habitat for migratory
birds and other species. 

        Our
Whole Trade Guarantee label is currently featured on more than 400 items, and sales of nearly $8 million to date have generated approximately $80,000 for the Whole Planet
Foundation. Our goal is to have more than 50% of our imported products from developing countries meet Whole Trade qualifications within 10 years. 

Private Label  

        An extension of our leadership position in the natural and organic foods industry is our strong family of private label brands. These products extend the
confidence and trust our customers have in our stores to their everyday lives. We've built upon this trust and over the last several years have significantly expanded our private label resources and
offerings, which currently feature over 2,000 SKUs led by our primary brands, 365 Everyday Value and 365 Organic. 

        In
addition to these nationally-driven programs, we have a number of store-made and regionally-made fresh items sold under the Whole Foods Market label. We also
offer specialty and organic coffee, tea and drinking chocolates through our Allegro Coffee Company subsidiary. 

10




 



•365 Everyday Value. In 1997, we introduced a line of products under the "365" label emphasizing everyday value. These
products meet our quality standards but are generally less expensive than the alternative products we sell. Our qualitative and quantitative research indicates that the "365" line is a highly
recognized and trusted brand with Whole Foods Market shoppers.
•365 Organic Everyday Value. In 2002, we expanded our private label program with the introduction of our "365 Organic" line.
The "365 Organic" brand provides all of the benefits of organic food at reduced prices. In 2003, we expanded this program into non-grocery departments, including a successful line of
organic fresh vegetables, and in 2006, we began the process of rebranding our Whole Kids Organic line, first introduced in 1998, under the "365 Organic" label with some new kid-friendly
designs.
•Whole Brands. In 2004, we introduced a new family of "Whole Brands," each aligned with department-specific quality and
sourcing standards. Included under the "Whole Brands" umbrella are "Whole Kitchen" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen grocery, "Whole Treat" for frozen desserts, cookies and candies, "Whole
Catch" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen seafood items, "Whole Fields" for produce and produce support items, "Whole Pantry" for items such as herbs, spices and condiments, "Whole
Creamery" for cheeses, "Whole Ranch" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen meat, and "Whole Paws" for tasty and healthful pet food. These brands go beyond the basics, offering unique items,
including innovative formulations, that embody our high quality standards and supplement our base value line of "365" and "365 Organic" items. Items within "Whole Brands" share a consistent logo
format and packaging so that our customers know each is part of a greater family. 


        At
our Whole Foods Market locations, private label sales in grocery and nutrition accounted for approximately 18% of our total retail sales in those product categories in fiscal year
2007, up from 16% in fiscal year 2006. Total private label sales across all teams accounted for approximately 9% of our retail sales in fiscal year 2007, up from 8% of our retail sales in fiscal year
2006, reflecting the roll-out of approximately 550 new items in fiscal year 2007. We believe our private label sales could grow to a much higher percentage of our sales over time, as we
continue to focus on the rapid development and growth of our product lines. 

<A
NAME="ca77202_economic_value_added"> 
 
Economic Value Added        

        We use Economic Value Added ("EVA"™) as a basis for our business decisions and for determining incentive compensation. In its simplest definition, EVA
is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes minus a charge for the cost of invested capital necessary to generate those profits. We believe one of our core strengths is our decentralized
culture, where decisions are made at the store level, close to the customer. We believe this is one of our strongest competitive advantages and that EVA is the best financial framework that team
members can use to help make decisions that create sustainable shareholder value. 

        We
use EVA extensively for capital investment decisions, including evaluating new store real estate decisions and store remodeling proposals. We only invest in projects that we believe
will add long-term value to the Company. The EVA decision-making model also enhances operating decisions in stores. Our emphasis is on EVA improvement, as we want to challenge our teams to
continue to innovate and grow EVA in new ways. We believe that opportunities always exist to increase sales and margins, to lower operating expenses and to make investments that add value in ways that
benefit all of our stakeholders. We believe that focusing on EVA improvement encourages continuous improvement of our business. 

11






<A
NAME="page_cc77202_1_12">  




        Over 750 leaders throughout the Company are on EVA-based incentive compensation plans, of which the primary measure is EVA improvement. EVA-based plans cover our
senior executive leadership, regional leadership and the store leadership team (store team leaders and assistant store team leaders) in all stores. Incentive compensation for each of these groups is
determined based on relevant EVA measures at different levels, including the total Company level, the regional level, the store or facility level, and the team level. We believe using EVA in a multi-
dimensional approach best measures the results of decisions made at different levels of the Company. We expect EVA to remain a significant component of our compensation structure throughout the
Company in the coming years. 

        Information
about our EVA financial results is not presented because of rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

NAME="cc77202_acquisition_of_wild_oats_markets,_inc."> 
 
Acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc.        

        On August 28, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc., a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in a
cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. To fund the transaction, we entered into a
five-year $700 million senior term loan agreement. We also signed a new five-year $250 million revolving credit agreement, which replaced our existing
$200 million line of credit. 

        At
the time of our acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace (nationwide), Henry's Farmers
Market (in Southern California), Sun Harvest (in Texas), and Capers Community Market (in British Columbia). All of our 11 operating regions gained stores, with our three smallest regions, the Florida,
Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions, gaining critical mass. The acquisition provided us with immediate entry into five new states: Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, and 15 new
markets: Bend, OR; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Lexington, KY; Little Rock, AR; Melbourne, FL; Memphis, TN; Naples, FL; Nashville, TN; Reno, NV; Salt Lake City, UT; Tampa, FL; Tucson, AZ; Tulsa,
OK; and Westport, CT. 

        On
September 30, 2007, we completed the sale of all 27 Henry's Farmers Market and eight Sun Harvest store locations and a related Riverside, CA distribution center to a wholly
owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer. Subsequent to year-end, the Company received proceeds of approximately $165 million for the
net assets of those stores, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventory, and operating leases. Additionally, Whole Foods Market and Smart & Final entered into a transition services
agreement under which Whole Foods Market will continue to provide certain general and administrative services for the 35 stores for up to two years. We currently anticipate that the revenue associated
with this agreement will be approximately equal to our incremental cost of providing the support. 


        Subsequent
to year-end, we closed eight Wild Oats stores in Portland, OR; Tualatin, OR; Matthews, KY; West Vancouver, Canada; Mission, KS; Littleton, CO; Omaha, NE; and
Saugus, MA. We also temporarily closed the Wild Oats store in Medford, MA for a major renovation; the store is scheduled to re-open in the spring of 2008. In addition, the Wild Oats stores
in Nashville, TN and Pasadena, CA were relocated to new Whole Foods Market stores in early November 2007. Net of these closures and relocations, the Company had 63 Wild Oats and Capers
locations on November 20, 2007, with plans to close one additional Wild Oats store in Portland, ME in fiscal year 2008. The Company also plans to relocate seven Wild Oats stores in British
Columbia, Canada; Littleton, CO; Naples, FL; Indianapolis, IN; St. Louis, MO; Reno, NV; and Salt Lake City, UT as the Whole Foods Market stores currently in development open in those areas.

Growth Strategy        

        Whole Foods Market's growth strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and acquisitions of existing stores. We have a disciplined,
opportunistic real estate strategy, opening stores in existing trade areas as well as new markets, including international markets. Our new stores typically range in size between 45,000 and 60,000
square feet and are located on premium real estate sites. We have also grown through acquisitions, with approximately 32% of our existing square footage coming from acquisitions. Because the natural
and organic foods retailing industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many smaller local and regional chains, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that provide access to
desirable markets, locations and experienced team members. Going forward, however, such acquisitions are not expected to impact our future store growth or financial results due to the size of the
Company's existing store base. 

13




 


        We
have an ongoing relocation strategy and actively relocate some of our smaller stores to larger locations with improved visibility and parking each year. For stores relocated in fiscal
years 2003 through 2007, the overall average increase in size was approximately 121%. Our historical store growth is summarized below:

        As
of November 20, 2007, we had signed leases for 87 stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2010 totaling approximately 4.5 million square feet, or approximately 48%
of our existing square footage. These stores, which average approximately 51,000 square feet in size and are roughly 48% larger than the average size of our existing store base, include 22 relocations
and 14 new markets. Our historical growth in stores in development is summarized below:

        We
have continued to sign and open smaller stores, typically in markets where it is hard to develop larger sites, while experimenting with opening some very large format stores. We
currently operate nine stores in excess of 65,000 gross square feet and have an additional 13 stores of that size in development, seven of which are relocations. On average, we are pleased with the
results of these larger format stores, as we believe they will deliver strong returns over time as they appeal to a broader customer base, take longer to reach capacity, and create a higher barrier to
entry, making them less vulnerable to competition. We plan to continue to selectively sign larger sites, which showcase extensive prepared foods and sit-down venues, but going forward, we
expect them to be predominantly in dense urban markets or relocations of some of our very successful existing stores. 

        As
shown in the table above, our total gross square footage and average size of stores in development were lower in fiscal year 2007 than in fiscal year 2006. This was due primarily to
two factors: more stores exiting the development pipeline as the acceleration in our new store openings materializes, and a decrease in the average size of new leases signed during the year. 


        Tender
dates provide some visibility on the timing of our new store openings. For accounting purposes, a lease is considered tendered on the date we take possession of the leased space
for construction and other purposes, which is typically when the shell of the store is complete or close to completion. As of November 20, 2007, 20 of our 87 stores in development had been
tendered to us. These 20 stores represent approximately 916,000 square feet. 

        The
"tender period," which we define as the length of time between a store's tender date and opening date, varies depending on several factors, some of which are outside of our control.
These factors include the size of the store and complexity of site development, the impact of weather and unforeseen environmental issues, and issues surrounding construction labor unions and local
government authorities, among other things. Furthermore, acquired leases, ground leases and owned properties generally have longer tender periods than standard operating leases because we take
possession of these locations earlier in the construction process. For stores opened during the past three fiscal years, the average tender period was 8.7 months.

Site Selection  

        Most of our stores are located in high-traffic shopping areas and are either freestanding or in a strip center. We also have a number of urban stores
located in high-density, mixed-use projects. In selecting store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential markets based on various criteria such as
education levels, population density and income levels within certain drive times. We primarily seek to open large-format stores, which typically range in size between 45,000 to 60,000 square feet and
are located on premier real estate sites, often in urban, high-population locales. After we have selected a target site, our development group does a comprehensive site study and sales
projection. Each project must meet an internal EVA hurdle return, which is generally cumulative positive EVA within seven years. 

        The
required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development
issues. For stores opened during the past two fiscal years excluding Kensington, the average size was 52,700 square feet and our new store investment averaged approximately $14.4 million
excluding pre-opening and relocation expenses, which averaged approximately $2.4 million per store.

Store Operations        

Team Approach to Store Operations  

        We strive to promote a strong Company culture featuring a team approach to store operations that we believe is distinctly more empowering of employees than that
of the traditional supermarket. Our domestic Whole Foods Market stores each employs between 85 and 600 team members who comprise up to 13 teams per store, each led by a team leader. Each team within a
store is responsible for a different product category or aspect of store operations such as customer service, prepared foods, or grocery, among others. Just as we have a regionally-focused framework,
we also promote a decentralized team approach to store operations in which many decisions are made by teams at the individual store level. In this structure, an effective store team leader is critical
to the success of the store. The store team leader works closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all of the department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently
and profitably as possible. Twice yearly, our team members are asked to complete a confidential, third party-administered team leader survey, which provides them with an opportunity to give their
leaders constructive feedback. 

        We
believe our success is dependent on the collective energy and intelligence of all of our team members. We strive to create a work environment where motivated team members can flourish
and reach their highest potential, and where they are inspired by work that provides them with a greater sense of purpose and mission. For many team members, their job is an extension of their
personal philosophy and lifestyle. Together, we go to great lengths to satisfy and delight our customers. 

        Team
members are involved at all levels of our business. We strive to create a Company-wide consciousness of "shared fate" by uniting the interests of team members as closely
as possible with the interests of our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through gainsharing. Our gainsharing program rewards things such as labor productivity that team members can
control, giving them a direct stake in the success of our business. We also encourage stock ownership among team members through the following programs: 



•Team
Member Stock Option Plan. All full-time and part-time team members are eligible to receive a grant of stock options each year. The annual grant
has two components: (i) Annual Leadership Grants to recognize and incentivize team member performance; and (ii) Service Hour Grants to recognize team member service to the Company. In
2007 our Board of Directors awarded approximately 1.7 million options to more than 13,400 team members. Of these stock options, 95% were granted to non-executives, with 47% awarded
as Service Hour Grants alone.
•Team
Member Stock Purchase Plan. Through bi-weekly payroll deductions, all U.S.-based non-seasonal team members with at least 400 service hours may
elect to purchase unrestricted shares of our stock at 95% of market value on the purchase date. The shares are purchased for the plan participants on a quarterly basis. Approximately 2,000 team
members currently participate in this plan.
•Team
Member 401(k) Plan. Whole Foods Market stock is an investment option within the Company's 401(k) plan.

Store Description  

        We do not have a standard store design model. Instead, each store's design is customized to fit the size and configuration of the particular location and
community in which it is located. Our culture and philosophy is one of continual innovation and experimentation, and successful experiments are voluntarily picked up and improved upon by our stores
and regions. We strive to transform food shopping from a chore into a dynamic experience by building and operating stores with colorful décor, well-trained team members,
exciting product mixes, teams of in-store chefs, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-stacked produce, prepared foods stations
and European-style charcuterie departments. To further a sense of community and interaction with customers, our stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and
customer service booths. We have "Take Action" centers for our customers who want to be informed on important issues relative to environmental, legislative, food safety and product quality issues that
can directly affect our customers' health and well-being. In addition, some stores offer special services such as massage, valet parking and home delivery. We believe our stores play a
unique role as a third place, besides the home and office, where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food. 

<A
NAME="ce77202_purchasing_and_distribution"> 
 
Purchasing and Distribution        

        Our buyers purchase products for retail sale from local, regional, national and international wholesale suppliers and vendors. The majority of our purchasing
occurs at the regional and national levels. This enables us to negotiate better volume discounts with major vendors and distributors, while allowing our regional and store buyers to focus on local
products and the unique product mix necessary to keep a neighborhood market feel in our stores. We are increasingly focusing more of our purchasing on producer-direct and manufacture-direct programs,
and we remain committed to buying from local producers that meet our high quality standards. 


        We
own two produce procurement centers which facilitate the procurement and distribution of the majority of the produce we sell. We also operate a national meat purchasing office, a
confectionary, four seafood processing and distribution facilities, a specialty coffee and tea procurement and brewing operation, and nine regional distribution centers, which distribute a full range
of products to our stores across the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have five regional commissary kitchens and 11 bakehouse facilities, all of which distribute products to our
stores. Other products are typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors. 


        United
Natural Foods, Inc. is our single largest third-party supplier, accounting for approximately 24% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2007. In November 2006, we
extended our long-term relationship with United Natural Foods as our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products. Our seven-year agreement allows us to concentrate
our capital and resources on executing on our new store development pipeline and to focus our internal distribution efforts around key perishable departments including produce, prepared foods, bakery,
seafood and meat.

NAME="ce77202_marketing"> 
 
Marketing        

        We spend much less on advertising and marketing than conventional supermarkets—approximately 0.5% of our total sales in fiscal year 2007. Instead, we
rely primarily on word-of-mouth recommendations and testimonials from our shoppers, as well as the publicity and excitement generated by our new store openings. We allocate our
marketing budget among region-wide programs, our individual stores' marketing efforts, and a national brand awareness initiative focusing primarily on national in-store
marketing programs and national and major-market public relations. Our stores spend most of their marketing budgets on in-store marketing-related activities, including signage and
in-store events such as taste fairs, classes, tours and product samplings. To create goodwill and develop a high profile within the community, each store also has a separate budget for
making contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities. We presently contribute at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to
not-for-profit organizations. 

<A
NAME="ce77202_customer_service"> 
 
Customer Service        

        Customers are our most important stakeholder, because without our customers, we would have no business. We genuinely care about the well-being of our
customers and empower our team members to do whatever it takes to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping trip. By doing so, we turn our customers into advocates for our business, who do
more than shop with us; they recommend Whole Foods Market to their friends and others. We want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, and knowledgeably. We believe that we generate greater
appreciation and loyalty from our customers by educating them about natural and organic foods, health, nutrition and the environment through our in-store "Take Action" centers as well as
on our corporate website at www.wholefoodsmarket.com, which features hundreds of recipes and a library of information about environmental, legislative, food safety, and product quality issues. 

<A
NAME="ce77202_team_members"> 
 
Team Members        

        As of September 30, 2007, we had approximately 52,600 team members, including approximately 44,900 full-time, 5,200 part-time and
2,400 temporary team members. Of the total, approximately 6,000 were Wild Oats Markets team members, including approximately 3,700 full-time, 2,000 part-time and 300 temporary
team members. We are proud that 90% of our permanent team members are full-time team members, which we believe is very high for the food retailing industry and allows us to better serve
our customers. 

        One
of our core values is supporting team member happiness and excellence, and we believe our innovative and egalitarian work environment with team members involved at all levels of our
business is a major reason for our success. We believe happy team members create happy customers, and happy customers create happy investors. Team members who have a voice in shaping the direction of
our Company and their future are empowered to make Whole Foods Market not only a great place to shop but a great place to build a career. All of our full-time and part-time
team members are eligible to receive stock options. In addition, team members are encouraged to take an active role in choosing the benefits made available by the Company by participating in a
Company-wide benefits vote every three years. The Company's second vote was held in fiscal year 2006 to determine the benefits program that will be in place from 2007 through 2009.
Approximately 77% of eligible team members voted in this important process, resulting in a benefits package that reflects the needs and desires of the majority of team members in the Company. One
outcome of the vote is that Whole Foods Market provides healthcare at no cost to eligible full-time team members. Eligible full-time team members are those who work 30 or more
hours per week and have worked a minimum of 800 service hours. Dependent healthcare premiums are shared based on a team member's tenure with the Company; the team member's share decreases as his/her
tenure increases. 

19




 


        For
the past 10 years, our team members have helped Whole Foods Market become one of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work for in America." In scoring companies, Fortune
places the greatest weight (two-thirds of the total) on responses to a random survey of 400 employees, with the remainder being Fortune's evaluation of each company's credibility, respect,
fairness and pride/camaraderie. Ranking number five in 2007, our highest ever, we are one of only 18 companies to make the "100 Best" list for 10 consecutive years since its inception. 

<A
NAME="ce77202_competition"> 
 
Competition        

        Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies from region to region and includes but is not limited to local, regional,
national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, other natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on
the basis of product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. We believe our commitment to natural and organic products, high quality standards, our focus on
customer service, and our competitive prices on comparable products differentiates us in this segmented marketplace. 

        Natural
and organic food is one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Most supermarkets offer at least a limited selection of these products, while some have chosen to
expand their selection more aggressively. We believe it works to our benefit for conventional supermarkets to offer natural and organic products for two reasons: first, it helps fulfill our Company
mission to improve the health, well-being and healing of both people and the planet, and second, it helps create new customers for us by creating a gateway experience. As more people are
exposed to the benefits of natural and organic products, we believe they are more likely to become Whole Foods Market customers since we are the category leader for natural and organic products,
offering the largest selection and most informed customer service at competitive prices. 

        Competition
makes us a better retailer. We are constantly evolving, innovating and maturing, and we have a long track record of responding to and improving with competition. We believe
we are better positioned from a value and price perspective today than we ever have been. Our buy-side initiatives are continuing to deliver opportunities that will allow us to be more
price competitive, and we are leveraging our global buying power to the benefit of our customers. On the sell side, our innovation will accelerate over the next few years as we continue to redefine
the marketplace and further differentiate our stores, products, and customer experience from the competition. 

        We
believe our strong comparable store sales growth, which historically has been significantly higher than the industry average, is evidence of this gateway experience and of our ability
to evolve faster than our competition.

Government and Public Affairs        

        Our stores are subject to various local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply
with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages.

manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the EPA. The composition and
labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FFDC Act"). The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years

Item 1A. Risk Factors.        

        We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by
forward-looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the SEC, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral
forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.

Our Growth Is Significantly Dependent on New Store Openings and Acquisitions  


        Our strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions of existing store locations or businesses. Successful
implementation of this strategy is contingent on numerous conditions, some of which are described below, and there can be no assurance that this expansion strategy can be successfully executed. 

        Our
continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores successfully. Our expansion
strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations, and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store
openings and/or acquisitions. We may not be able to timely open new stores or operate them successfully. Also, we may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members or integrate those
team members into the programs and policies of the Company. We may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores
at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. 

We May Not Be Able to Successfully Integrate Acquired Businesses into Our Operations  

        We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations and support systems, or the operations of acquired businesses may be
adversely affected by the introduction of our decentralized operational approach. Also, the integration of acquired operations into our operations requires the dedication of management resources that
may temporarily detract attention from our day-to-day business. 

New Stores May Negatively Impact Our Results  

        There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their
sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
As we accelerate our rate of new store openings, thus increasing the percentage of our sales from new stores and decreasing the average age of our store base, there may be a negative impact on our
results from a lower contribution of these new stores, along with the impact of related pre-opening and relocation costs. 

We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Comparable Store Sales  

        Our comparable store sales could fluctuate or be lower than our historical average for many reasons including new and acquired stores entering into the comparable
store base, the opening of new stores that cannibalize store sales in existing markets, increased competition, price changes in response to competitive factors, possible supply shortages, and cycling
against several years of above-average sales results. Our results of operations may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our comparable store sales as the result of lower sales, lower gross
profits and/or greater operating costs such as marketing. 

24




 


We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Quarterly Operating Results  

        Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate for many reasons, including losses from new stores, variations in the mix of product sales, price changes in
response to competitive factors, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increases in store operating costs, possible supply shortages, extreme weather-related disruptions, including hurricanes
and earthquakes, and potential uninsured casualty losses or other losses. In addition, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as the result of the timing of new store openings and
pre-opening costs, the timing of acquisitions, store closures and relocations and the range of operating results generated from newly opened. Quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. 


Increased Competition May Have an Adverse Effect on Profitability  

        Our competitors include but are not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, other natural food stores,
warehouse membership clubs, small specialty stores and restaurants. These businesses compete with us in one or more product categories. In addition, some are expanding more aggressively in marketing a
range of natural and organic foods, thereby competing directly with us for products, customers and locations. Some of these potential competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater
financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. As competition in certain markets intensifies, our results of
operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes, and/or greater operating costs such as marketing. 

Our Business May be Sensitive to Economic Conditions that Impact Consumer Spending  

        Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future
economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of
terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts
in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 

Legal Proceedings Could Materially Impact Our Results  

        From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property,
acquisitions, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the FTC is currently pursing an administrative proceeding concerning our recent acquisition of Wild Oats
Markets. Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings. 

We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People Are Harmed By the Products We Sell  

        There is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their
interest in health, nutrition and food safety. We believe that our customers hold us to a higher food safety standard than conventional supermarkets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food
products by us could result in product liability claims, the settlement or outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 

25




 


The Loss of Key Management Could Negatively Affect Our Business  

        We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose the services of a significant number of key team members within a
short period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued success is also dependent upon our ability
to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. We
may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business. 

Unions May Attempt to Organize Our Team Members  

        Unions have from time to time attempted to organize all or part of our team member base at certain stores and non-retail facilities. Responding to
such organization attempts is distracting to management and team members and may have a negative financial impact on a store, facility or the Company as a whole. 

Unfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Could Harm Our Business  

        Our stores are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must
comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages. Our new
store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. 


        The
manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the FDA, FTC, CPSC, USDA and
EPA. The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the FFDC Act. The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to
dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. 

        The
USDA's Organic Rule, implemented into federal law on October 21, 2002, facilitates interstate commerce and the marketing of organically produced food and provides assurance to
our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with this rule could pose a significant burden on some of our suppliers, which may cause a disruption in some of our
product offerings. 

        We
cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders,
when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet
new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or
different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

26




 


A Widespread Health Epidemic Could Materially Impact Our Business  

        The Company's business could be severely impacted by a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic. Our stores are a place where customers come
together, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food. A widespread health epidemic may cause customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise
change their shopping behaviors. Additionally, a widespread health epidemic could also adversely impact our business by disrupting production and delivery of products to our stores and by impacting
our ability to appropriately staff our stores. 

Changes in the Availability of Quality Natural and Organic Products Could Impact Our Business  

        There is no assurance that quality natural and organic products will be available to meet our future needs. If conventional supermarkets significantly increase
their natural and organic product offerings or if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, the supply of these products may be constrained. Any significant
disruption in the supply of quality natural and organic products could have a material impact on our overall sales and cost of goods sold. 

Perishable Foods Product Losses Could Materially Impact Our Results  

        We believe our stores more heavily emphasize perishable products than conventional supermarket stores. Perishable products accounted for approximately 67% of
total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. The Company's emphasis on perishable products may result in significant product inventory losses in the event of extended power
outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. 

Our Stock Price Is Volatile  

        The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events. These market factors and events
include variations in our sales and earnings results, changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, publicity regarding us, our competitors, the natural products industry generally, new
statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the natural products industry specifically, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the
public market or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Changes in the Number of Stock Option Exercises Could Impact Our Cash Flow  


        Our cash flow from the exercise of team member stock options may be adversely affected in the future by fluctuations in the market price of our common stock,
changes in income tax law, and changes in the number of stock options we grant. 

Capital Needed for Expansion May Not Be Available  

        The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and
renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through proceeds from public offerings, bank debt, private placements of debt,
internally generated cash flow, and proceeds from stock option exercises. These and other sources of capital may not be available to us in the future. In addition, restrictive covenants that may be
imposed by our lenders may restrict our ability to fund our growth. 

27




 


We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights  

        We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property.
There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain
foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary
information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Self-Insurance Plan Claims Could Materially Impact Our Results  

        The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general
liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other
expenses related to such plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 

Changes in Accounting Standards Could Materially Impact Our Results  

        Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of our business,
such as accounting for insurance and self-insurance, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, store closures, leases, income taxes and share-based compensation, are highly complex and
involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported earnings without a comparable underlying change in
cash flow from operations. 

Effective Tax Rate Changes and Results of Examinations by Taxing Authorities Could Materially Impact Our Results  

        Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states or countries where we have lower
statutory rates and higher than historical results in states or countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in
tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities. Our results
could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. 

The Company May Discontinue Paying Dividends in the Future  

        Dividends are paid at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which
the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. There is no guarantee that the Company will pay dividends
in the future. 

28




 


Failure of our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Materially Impact our Business and Results  

        The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial
results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
