    Business
Objectives
    
    The
Company's primary business objectives are to increase stockholders’ value by
investing in and operating communities located in supply constrained markets,
and by improving operating results and the value of its Communities, while
maintaining a strong balance sheet.  The Company intends to achieve
these objectives by:
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Maintain
      high level of occupancy to maximize rental
  income;
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Improve
      financial performance of  the Company's Portfolio through
      acquisitions, dispositions, development and, when appropriate,
      redevelopment of  apartment communities in selected major
      metropolitan areas; and
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Maintain
      a strong balance sheet by identifying and utilizing capital resources that
      provide positive arbitrage (i.e. investment yield that exceeds capital
      cost).
            
          
      
    
    
    The
Company cannot assure stockholders that the Company will achieve its business
objectives.

Strategies
    
    Research Driven
Approach – We
believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth
begin with extensive regional economic research and local market
knowledge.
    
    Utilizing
a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last two decades,
we continually assess markets where we currently operate, as well as markets
where we consider future investment opportunities by evaluating the
following:
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Markets
      in major metropolitan areas that have regional population primarily in
      excess of one million;
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Constraints
      on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites
      where competing housing could be built; (ii) political growth barriers,
      such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and
      expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to
      development, such as mountains or
waterways;
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Rental
      demand is enhanced by affordability of rents compared to expensive
      for-sale housing; and
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Housing
      demand that is based on proximity to jobs, high quality of life and
      related commuting factors, as well as potential job
  growth.
            
          
      
    
    
    Recognizing
that all real estate markets are cyclical, we regularly evaluate the results of
our regional economic, as well as our local market research, and adjust the
geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly. We seek to increase our portfolio
allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to
decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio
allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease
such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative
yields.
    
    Property
Operations – We manage our Communities by focusing on strategies that
will generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and
long-term asset appreciation. We intend to achieve this by utilizing the
strategies set forth below:

      July 2008, the Company acquired Chestnut Street Apartments, a 96-unit
      apartment community located in Santa Cruz, California, for $22.1 million.
      The community was built in 2002 and includes approximately 9,000 square

    Dispositions
of Real Estate
     
    As part
of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets
the Company continually evaluates all the Communities and sell those which no
longer meet our strategic criteria. The Company may use the capital
generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities,
repurchase the Company's common stock, or repay debts.  The
Company believes that the sale of these Communities will not have a
material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their
sale materially affect our ongoing operations. Generally, any impact of earnings
dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact
of our acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities.

    Development
Pipeline
     
    The
Company defines development activities as new communities that are in various
stages of active development, or the community is in lease-up and phases of the
project are not completed.  As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
four development projects comprised of 988 units for an estimated cost of $410.0
million, of which $234.6 million remains to be expended.  These four
projects exclude development projects owned by Essex Apartment Value Fund II,
L.P. (“Fund II”) an investment fund formed by the Company which the Company does
not consolidate.
     
    In May
2008, the Company’s consolidated joint venture, Joule Broadway, obtained a
construction loan in the amount of $60.0 million secured by the development
project in Seattle, Washington.  The loan is variable based on LIBOR
plus 155 basis points and matures in June 2011 with two one-year extension
options.  Approximately $9.3 million of future development costs will
be funded by the joint venture partners during 2009 and the remainder of the
estimated development costs will be funded by the construction
loan.  The estimated remaining costs to be incurred totaling $165.3
million for the other three active development projects including The Grand,
Fourth Street, and Tasman Place will be financed by the Company’s lines of
credit.  The following table sets forth information regarding the
Company’s consolidated development pipeline:

    The
Company defines the predevelopment pipeline as proposed communities in
negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming
entitled development projects.  As of December 31, 2008, the Company
had two development projects aggregating 820 units that were classified as
predevelopment projects.  The estimated total cost of the
predevelopment pipeline at December 31, 2008 was $242.4 million, of which $169.4
million remains to be expended.   The Company may also acquire
land for future development purposes.   The Company owned four
land parcels held for future development aggregating 392 units as of December
31, 2008.  The Company had incurred $23.9 million in costs related to
these four land parcels as of December 31, 2008.
    
    Redevelopment
Pipeline
    
    The
Company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned or
recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the
Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property
improvement.  During redevelopment, apartment units may not be
available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized
operations.  As of December 31, 2008, the Company had ownership
interests in nine major redevelopment communities aggregating 2,631 apartment
units with estimated redevelopment costs of $128.0 million, of which
approximately $56.5 million remains to be expended.  These amounts
exclude redevelopment projects owned by Fund II.   The following
table illustrates these consolidated redevelopment projects:

    OFFICES
AND EMPLOYEES
    
    The
Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has regional offices in
Woodland Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California and
Bellevue, Washington. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately 930
employees.
    
    INSURANCE
    
    The
Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance for each of the Communities.  Insured risks for
comprehensive liabilities covers claims in excess of $25,000 per incident, and
property casualty insurance covers losses in excess of a $5.0 million deductible
per incident. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such
as, for example, losses from terrorism and earthquake, for which the Company
does not have insurance. Substantially all of the Communities are located in
areas that are subject to earthquakes.
    
    The
Company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake
losses.  The Company utilizes third-party seismic consultants for its
acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are
determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an
earthquake.  The Company utilizes internal and third-party loss models
to help to determine its exposure.  The majority of the Communities
are lower density garden-style apartments which may be less susceptible to
earthquake damage.  The Company will continue to monitor third-party
earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining
third-party coverage if it deems it cost effective.
    
    Although
the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its
Communities, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may
still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in
excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
material.

    COMPETITION
    
    There are
numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in
attracting residents. These include other apartment communities and
single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the
apartment communities are located. The Communities also compete for residents
with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the demand
for our Communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire
competing apartment communities on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates and
occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition and results of operations.
    
    We face
competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other
entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities.
Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we
do. This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities we
acquire and/or develop.
    
    WORKING
CAPITAL
    
    We
believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing cash balances,
availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the
ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to
meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2009.  The
timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and
used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and
other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect our
plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment
activities.
    
    ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSIDERATIONS
    
    See the
discussion under the caption, “The Company’s Portfolio may have
unknown environmental liabilities” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for
information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our
operations.
    
    OTHER
MATTERS
    
    Certain
Policies of the Company
    
    We intend
to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company has in the past five years and
may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock, (ii) fund
acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer
shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for
property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership
interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly
through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are
real estate. In general, the Company does not (i) underwrite securities of other
issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other investments.
    
    We invest
primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal
markets within Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Seattle
metropolitan area. The Company currently intends to continue to invest in
apartment communities in such regions.  However, these practices may
be reviewed and modified periodically by management.
    
    Item 1A. Risk Factors
     
    Our
business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions are subject to
various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
recent results or from our anticipated future results.
     
    We depend on our
key personnel.   Our success depends on our ability to attract
and retain executive officers, senior officers and company managers. There is
substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and
the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on
us.
     
    Capital and
credit market conditions may affect our access to sources of capital and/or the
cost of capital, which could negatively affect our business, results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.  The Company’s
current financing activities have been impacted by the instability and
tightening in the credit markets which has led to an increase in spreads and
pricing of secured and unsecured debt.  Our strong balance sheet, the
established relationships with our unsecured line of credit bank group, the
secured line of credit with Freddie Mac and access to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
secured debt financing have provided some insulation to us from the turmoil
being experienced by many other real estate companies.  The Company
has benefited from borrowing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and there are no
assurances that these entities will lend to the Company in the
future.  The Company has experienced more restrictive loan to value
and debt service coverage ratio limits and an expansion in credit
spreads.   Continued turmoil in the capital markets could
negatively impact the Company’s ability to make acquisitions, develop
communities, obtain new financing, and refinance existing borrowing at
competitive rates.

    Debt financing
has inherent risks.  At December 31, 2008, we had approximately
$1.76 billion of indebtedness (including $251.1 million of variable rate
mortgage indebtedness, of which $183.4 million is subject to interest rate
protection agreements). We are subject to the risks normally associated with
debt financing, including the following:

              repaying
      debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment
      penalties.
            
          
      
    
     
    The Company is
uncertain about its ability to refinance balloon payments.  As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.76 billion of mortgage loans,
exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings, most of which are subject to
balloon payments (see Notes 7 and 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements for more details).  We do not expect to have sufficient
cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments. These
mortgages, bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled
principal and balloon payments:
     
    2009--$35.8
million;
    2010--$152.4
million;
    2011--$151.3
million;
    2012--$31.8
million;
    2013--$312.8
million;
    Thereafter--$1.08
billion.
     
    We may
not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness, bonds, or lines of
credit.  The Communities subject to these mortgages could be
foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender.  This could
cause us to lose income and asset value.  We may be required to
refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as
favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
     
    Debt financing of
Communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service
debt.  Where possible, we intend to continue to use leverage to
increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional
investments that we could not otherwise make.  There is a risk that
the cash flow from the Communities will be insufficient to meet both debt
payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate
investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  We may
obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all
of the Communities.  These mortgages may be recourse, non-recourse, or
cross-collateralized.
     
    As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had 71 of its 122 consolidated Communities
encumbered by debt.  Of the 71 Communities, 55 are secured by deeds of
trust relating solely to those Communities.  With respect to the
remaining 16 Communities, there are 4 cross-collateralized mortgages secured by
8 Communities, 3 Communities, 3 Communities, and 2 Communities,
respectively.  The holders of this indebtedness will have rights with
respect to these Communities and, to the extent indebtedness is
cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose upon communities which are
not the primary collateral for their loan.  This may accelerate other
indebtedness secured by communities.  Foreclosure of Communities would
reduce our income and net asset value.
     
    Rising interest
rates may affect our costs of capital and financing activities and results of
operation.  Interest rates could increase rapidly, which could
result in higher interest expense on our variable rate
indebtedness.  Prolonged interest rate increases could negatively
impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with
positive economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing
borrowings.
     
    As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $236.2 million of long-term
variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate
of short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which mature at various dates from 2020
through 2034), $14.9 million of short-term variable rate indebtedness related to
predevelopment projects due in 2010, and $120.0 million of variable rate
indebtedness under the secured line of credit due in December 2013 and bears
interest at 99 to 150 basis points over the Freddie Mac Reference Rate and the
interest rate is subject to change by the lender in December
2011.   Approximately $183.4 million of the long-term variable
rate indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements, which
may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest
rates.  The remaining $52.8 million of long-term variable rate
indebtedness and the $120.0 borrowings under the secured line of credit were not
subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of December 31,
2008.  An increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our
net income and results of operations.

    Interest rate
hedging arrangements may result in losses.   Periodically, we
have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in
interest rates, and may continue to do so.  Although these agreements
may partially protect against rising interest rates, they also may reduce the
benefits to us if interest rates decline.  If a hedging arrangement is
not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, we may be
exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the
rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each
other.  Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging
arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks.  In order to
minimize counterparty credit risk, our policy is to enter into hedging
arrangements only with A-rated financial institutions.
     
    Bond compliance
requirements may limit income from certain communities.   At
December 31, 2008, we had approximately $236.2 million of variable rate
tax-exempt financing relating to the following apartment communities: Inglenook
Court, Wandering Creek, Boulevard, Huntington Breakers, Camarillo Oaks, Fountain
Park, Anchor Village and Hidden Valley.  This tax-exempt financing
subjects these Communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive
covenants.  We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the
future.  The Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations there
under impose various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding
interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax
purposes.  The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20%
of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not
exceed a specified percentage, generally 50%, of the median income for the
applicable family size as determined by the Housing and Urban Development
Department of the federal government.  In addition to federal
requirements, certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental
restrictions.  These restrictions may limit income from the tax-exempt
financed communities if we are required to lower rental rates to attract
residents who satisfy the median income test.  If the Company does not
reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these
income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds may be terminated, the
obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to
additional contractual liability.
     
    General real
estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and
values.   Real estate investments are subject to a variety of
risks.  The yields available from equity investments in real estate
depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred.  If
the Communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses,
including debt service and capital expenditures, cash flow and the ability to
make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected.  Income
from the Communities may be further adversely affected by, among other things,
the following factors:

    As leases
on the Communities expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are
less favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may be adversely
affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the
availability and terms of financing.  Real estate investments are
relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly
in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite
limited.
     
    National and
regional economic environments can negatively impact our operating
results.  During the past twelve to eighteen months, a
confluence of many factors has contributed to deteriorate economic conditions,
diminish expectations for the national and global economy, and cause
unprecedented turmoil and volatility in the capital markets.  The
Company’s 2009 forecast assumes continued slowing of the national economy, with
estimated GDP decline of 1.3% and non-farm employment decrease of 2 million
jobs.  The national economy and the economies of the western states in
markets where we operate can impact our operating results.  Some of
these markets are concentrated in high-tech sectors, which have experienced
economic downturns, and currently the high-tech sector is experiencing the
impact of the deteriorating economic conditions as well as are most other
sectors of the economy.  Our property type and diverse geographic
locations provide some degree of risk mitigation.  However, we are not
immune to prolonged economic downturns.  Although we believe we are
well positioned to meet these challenges, it is possible a reduction in rental
rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs
such as advertising, turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in
the event of continued economic turmoil.

    Inflation/Deflation may affect
rental rates and operating expenses. Substantial inflationary or
deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property
operating expenses.
     
    Acquisitions of
communities may fail to meet expectations.  We intend to
continue to acquire apartment communities.  However, there are risks
that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations.  Our estimates
of future income, expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that
are necessary to allow us to market an acquired apartment community as
originally intended may prove to be inaccurate.  We expect to finance
future acquisitions, in whole or in part, under various forms of secured or
unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the
Operating Partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the
Company.  The use of equity financing, rather than debt, for future
developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the Company’s existing
stockholders.  If we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of
credit, there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute financing, the Company
may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such
lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms.
     
    Development and
redevelopment activities may be delayed, not completed, and/or not achieve
expected results.   We pursue development and
redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental
and other approvals, which have no assurance of being received. Our development
and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks, including the

    These
risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the Company’s
stockholders.  Further, the development and redevelopment of
communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate
investments. For further information regarding these risks, please see the risk
factor “General real estate
investment risks may adversely affect property income and
values.”
     
    The geographic
concentration of the Company’s Communities and fluctuations in local markets may
adversely impact our financial condition and operating
results.  The Company generated significant amounts of rental
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, from our Communities concentrated
in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and
Ventura counties), Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), and the
Seattle metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2008, 82% of the Company’s rental
revenues were generated from Communities located in California.  This
geographic concentration could present risks if local property market
performance falls below expectations. The economic condition of these markets
could affect occupancy, market rental rates, and expenses, as well as impact the
income generated from the Communities and their underlying asset
values.  The financial results of major local employers also may
impact the cash flow and value of certain of the Communities.  This
could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results,
which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our
stockholders.
     
    Competition in
the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental
demand for our Communities.  There are numerous housing
alternatives that compete with our Communities in attracting
residents.  These include other apartment communities and
single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the
Communities are located. The Communities also compete for residents with new and
existing homes and condominiums that are for sale.  If the demand for
our Communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing
apartment communities on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may drop,
which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
of operations.  We also face competition from other real estate
investment trusts, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development
and operation of apartment communities.  Some of the competitors are
larger and have greater financial resources than we do. This competition may
result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that we
acquire and/or develop.

    Dividend
requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to
sustain dividends.   We have
Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) with
an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $25 million outstanding and
Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series G Preferred Stock”)
with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $94.9 million
outstanding as of February 2009.  In addition, we are required under
limited conditions to issue Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units
(“Series B Preferred Units”) with an aggregate liquidation preference of $80
million in exchange for outstanding preferred interests in the Operating
Partnership. The terms of the Series B Preferred Units, Series F and G Preferred
Stock provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each
share of preferred units or stock.
     
    These
terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding, we cannot
authorize, declare, or pay any distributions on our common stock, unless all
distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid
in full. Our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our credit agreement limits
our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a
fixed charge coverage ratio.
     
    If the
Company wishes to issue any common stock in the future (including upon the
exercise of stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends
at current levels will be increased.  The Company’s ability to pay
dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current Communities
and other apartment communities that may be acquired or developed in the
future.
     
    If the
Company cannot pay dividends on its common stock, the Company’s status as a real
estate investment trust may be jeopardized. Our ability to pay dividends on our
common stock is further limited by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Under
the Maryland General Corporation Law, the Company may not make a distribution on
stock if, after giving effect to such distribution, either:

the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued, pursuant to a registration
statement, 5,980,000 shares of 4.875% Series G Cumulative Preferred Stock for
gross proceeds of $149.5 million; such shares are convertible, subject to
certain conditions, into common stock, which could be sold into the public
market.  During 2009, the Company has repurchased $54.6 million of the

exchangeable bonds (the “Bonds”) outstanding which mature on November 1, 2025.
The Bonds are exchangeable into the Company's common stock on or after November
1, 2020 or prior to November 1, 2020 under certain circumstances. The Bonds are
redeemable at the Company's option for cash at any time on or after November 4,
2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on
November 1st in the
years 2010, 2015 and 2020, or upon the occurrence of certain events. The Bonds

the Company sold 5,980,000 shares of 4.875% Series G Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock (the “Series G Preferred Stock”) for gross proceeds of $149.5
million, of which $94.9 million in aggregate liquidation value is
outstanding as of February 2009.  Holders may convert Series G
Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock subject to certain
conditions.  The conversion rate was initially .1830 shares of common
stock per $25 share liquidation preference, which is equivalent to an initial
conversion price of $136.62 per share of common stock (the conversion rate will
be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events).  On
or after July 31, 2011, the Company may, under certain circumstances cause some
or all of the Series G Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of common
stock at the then prevailing conversion rate.  Further, if a
fundamental change occurs, as defined in the articles supplementary for the
Series G Preferred Stock, then the holders may require the Company to repurchase
all or part of their Series G Preferred Stock subject to certain
conditions.
     
    The
exchange of the Bonds and/or Series G Preferred Stock for common stock would
dilute stockholder ownership in the Company, and such exchange could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity securities.  If the Bonds and
Series G Preferred Stock are not exchanged, the repurchase price of the Bonds
and Series G Preferred Stock may discourage or impede transactions that might
otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock. Further, these
repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where the Company needs to
conserve its cash reserves, in which event such repurchase might adversely
affect the Company and its common stockholders.
     
    The
Company’s  future issuances of common stock, preferred stock or
convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our
common stock.  In order to
finance our acquisition and development activities, we have issued and sold
common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt securities.  For
example, during 2008 and 2007, the Company issued and sold 1,209,050 and
1,670,500 shares of common stock for $142.8 million and $213.7 million, net of
fees and commissions, respectively.  The Company may in the future
sell further shares of common stock, including pursuant to its controlled equity
offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
     
    In
November 2008, the holders of the outstanding 7.875% Series D Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units of Essex Portfolio, L.P. exchanged their preferred
units with a par value of $50.0 million for 363,000 shares of common stock of
the Company and $10.0 million in cash plus accrued dividends.
     
    In 2007,
the Company filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC, allowing the
Company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined
in the prospectus.  Future sales of common stock, preferred stock or
convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the Company and
could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.
     
    The
Company’s  Chairman is involved in other real estate activities and
investments, which may lead to conflicts of
interest.   Our Chairman, George M. Marcus is not an
employee of the Company, and is involved in other real estate activities and
investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. Mr. Marcus owns interests
in various other real estate-related businesses and investments.  He
is the Chairman of The Marcus & Millichap Company (“TMMC”), which is a
holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies. TMMC
has an interest in Pacific Property Company, a company that invests in apartment
communities.

    Mr.
Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in
his capacity as Chairman of the Company to any of his affiliated companies and
that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the Company Board of
Directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of an apartment
community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of
his affiliated companies.  Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr. Marcus
and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring and/or
developing apartment communities, which competition may be detrimental to
us.  In addition, due to such potential competition for real estate
investments, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of
interest with us, which may be detrimental to the interests of the Company’s
stockholders.
     
    The influence of
executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to
holders of common stock.  As of December 31, 2008, George M.
Marcus, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, wholly or partially owned
1,772,199 shares of common stock (including shares issuable upon exchange of
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and certain other
partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options). This represents
approximately 6.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Marcus
currently does not have majority control over us.  However, he
currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant influence with
respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant
corporate actions.  Consequently, his influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our
stockholders.
     
    Under the
partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of the holders
of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the
agreement and for certain extraordinary actions.  Through their
ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us, our
directors and executive officers, including Mr. Marcus, have substantial
influence on us.  Consequently, their influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders.
    
    The voting rights
of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that
otherwise benefit holders of common stock. In general, the holders
of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights.
However, if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock
for six quarterly distributions periods, the holders of preferred stock who have
not received distributions, voting together as a single class, will have the
right to elect two additional directors to serve on our Board of
Directors.
     
    These
voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for
the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full. At
that time, the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting
rights, and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately
terminates. While any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding, the Company
may not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of each series of preferred stock, each voting separately as a single
class:

    The Maryland
business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the Company
and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law.  Under Maryland
law, “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and an interested
stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five
years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder.  These business combinations include a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an
asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity
securities.  An interested stockholder is defined as any person (and
certain affiliates of such person) who beneficially owns ten percent or more of
the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock.  The law also
requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions. This means that
the transaction must be approved by at least:

      of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares
      other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the
      business combination is to be
effected.
            
          
      
    
     
    The
statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business
combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that
the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.  These
voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price, as
defined under Maryland law.  As permitted by the statute, the Board of
Directors of the Company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business
combination by us, George M. Marcus, William A. Millichap, who are the chairman
and a director of the Company, respectively, and TMMC or any entity owned or
controlled by Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and TMMC. Consequently, the five-year
prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to
any business combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or
TMMC.  As a result, we may in the future enter into business
combinations with Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and TMMC, without compliance with
the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the Maryland General
Corporation Law.
     
    Anti-takeover
provisions contained in the Operating Partnership agreement, charter, bylaws,
and certain provisions of Maryland law could delay, defer or prevent a change in
control.  While the Company
is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and generally has full
and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the
Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership agreement
place limitations on the Company’s ability to act with respect to the Operating
Partnership.  Such limitations could delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our
stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could
otherwise adversely affect the interest of the Company’s
stockholders.  The partnership agreement provides that if the limited
partners own at least 5% of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership, the Company cannot, without first obtaining the consent
of a majority-in-interest of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership,
transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the Operating
Partnership to another entity.  Such limitations on the Company’s
ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the
Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of the Company’s
stockholders.  As of December 31, 2008, the limited partners held or
controlled approximately 8.4% of the outstanding units of partnership interest
in the Operating Partnership, allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited
partners.
     
    The
Company’s Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock
or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of
such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common
stock.  We may establish one or more series of preferred stock that
could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control.  Such a transaction might involve a premium price for our
stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common
stock.  Also, such a class of preferred stock could have dividend,
voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of
common stock.
    
    The
Company’s Charter contains other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the
Company’s stockholders.  The Charter contains ownership provisions
limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock, which may
have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change
in control.  For example, subject to receiving an exemption from the
Board of Directors, potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6% in value
of the stock (other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). This
may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common
stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their
shares of common stock.

    The
Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed
to be “control shares.”   Under the Maryland General Corporations
Law, “control shares” are those which, when aggregated with any other shares
held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within
specified ranges.  Although the Bylaws exempt the Company from the
control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law, the Board of
Directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any time in the
future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the
Bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the
Maryland General Corporations Law not only to control shares which may be
acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously
acquired.  If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated,
the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law could
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a
premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the
Company’s stockholders.
    
    Our
Charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions

    The Company’s
joint ventures and joint ownership of Communities and partial interests in
corporations and limited partnerships could limit the Company’s ability to
control such Communities and partial interests.   Instead of
purchasing apartment communities directly, we have invested and may continue to
invest in joint ventures.  Joint venture partners often have shared
control over the operation of the joint venture assets.  Therefore, it
is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt,
or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our
business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our
instructions or requests, or our policies or
objectives.  Consequently, a joint venture partners’ actions might
subject property owned by the joint venture to additional
risk.  Although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any
joint venture to achieve its objectives, we may be unable to take action without
our joint venture partners’ approval, or joint venture partners could take
actions binding on the joint venture without our
consent.   Should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we
could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture
liabilities.
     
    From time
to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in corporations, limited
partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been
formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. In
certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership’s interest in a particular
entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that
entity.  Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s ability to control the
daily operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore, the Operating
Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of
directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or partners (in
the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event that its
operations conflict with the Operating Partnership’s objectives.  The
Operating Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an
entity. In the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the Operating
Partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the
entity.  We have, and in the future may, enter into transactions that
could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners, which contribute assets
into joint ventures or the Operating Partnership, in the event that certain
taxable events, which are within our control, occur.  Although we plan
to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale
pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if
such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on
our financial position.

    Investments in
mortgages and other real estate securities could affect our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.  The Company may invest in
securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect our ability to
make distributions to stockholders.  The Company may purchase
securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or
unsecured debt obligations.  These mortgages may be first, second or
third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise
guaranteed.  In general, investments in mortgages include the
following risks:

    If any of

expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected.
     
    The Company’s
Portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities.   Under
various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or
operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
certain hazardous or toxic substances on, in, to or migrating from such
property.  Such laws often impose liability without regard as to
whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of
such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the
failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s
or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral. Persons exposed to such substances, either through soil
vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages. Persons
who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or
wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such
substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or
wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such
person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of
asbestos-containing materials (“ACMs”) into the air, and third parties may seek
recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury
associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect),
operation, management and development of apartment communities, the Company
could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having
arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and,
therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well
as certain other costs, including governmental fines and costs related to
injuries of persons and property.
     
    Investments
in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of
the owner of such real property.  We carry certain limited insurance
coverage for this type of environmental risk.  We have conducted
environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination
at certain Communities.  Such contamination at certain of these
apartment communities was reported to have migrated on-site from adjacent
industrial manufacturing operations.  The former industrial users of
the Communities were identified as the source of contamination.  The
environmental studies noted that certain Communities are located adjacent to any
possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination, the
lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment
communities.  The environmental studies also noted that at certain of
these apartment communities, contamination existed because of the presence of
underground fuel storage tanks, which have been removed.  In general,
in connection with the ownership, operation, financing, management and
development of apartment communities we may be potentially liable for removal or
clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and environmental
liabilities.  We may also be subject to governmental fines and costs
related to injuries to persons and property.

    Recently
there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of
apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the
presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have
resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements.  The
Company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some, but not
all, of such matters.   Insurance carriers have reacted to mold
related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies
and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates.  The
Company has, however, purchased pollution liability insurance, which includes
some coverage for mold.  The Company has adopted policies for promptly
addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected, and to minimize
any impact mold might have on residents of the property.  The Company
believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known
existence, reduces its risk of loss from these cases.  There can be no
assurances that the Company has identified and responded to all mold
occurrences, but the company promptly addresses all known reports of
mold.  Liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.  As of December 31, 2008,
potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not
considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated.
     
    California
has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that
“clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to
chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity, including tobacco smoke.  Although we have sought to comply
with Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not be
adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.
     
    Methane
gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in
several areas, particularly in the Southern California coastal areas. 
Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined spaces. 
Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the state or
federal level, however some local governments, such as the County of Los
Angeles, have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems
in areas where methane gas is known to be
located.    Methane gas is also associated with certain
industrial activities, such as former municipal waste
landfills.  Radon is also a naturally-occurring gas that is found
below the surface.  The Company cannot assure you that it will not be
adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas
related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon
gas.
     
    The
Company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for
potential environmental clean-up costs at its Communities.  The
Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential
liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental
conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the
Company.  No assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the Communities reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not
create any material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a
material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the
Communities.  The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types
of environmental liabilities described above.
     
    The Company may
incur general uninsured losses.  The Company carries
comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance for
each of the Communities.  There are, however, certain types of
extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses for terrorism or earthquake,
for which the Company does not have insurance coverage. Substantially all of the
Communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
activity.  In January 2007, the Company canceled its then existing
earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific
Western Insurance LLC (“PWI”).  Through PWI, the Company is
self-insured as it relates to earthquake related
losses.  Additionally, since January 2008, PWI has provided property
and casualty insurance coverage for the first $5.0 million of the Company’s
property level insurance claims per incident.
     
    Although
the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its
Communities, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may
still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in
excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
material.  In the event of a substantial loss, insurance coverage may
not be able to cover the full current market value of replacement cost of the
Company’s lost investment, or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not
be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses.  Inflation,
changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other
factors might also affect the Company’s ability to replace or renovate an
apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed.
     
    Changes in real
estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the Company’s results of
operations.  Generally we do not directly pass through costs
resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants.
We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other
taxes, to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect funds from
operations and the ability to make distributions to
stockholders.  Similarly, compliance with changes in (i) laws
increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on
apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
(ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing
may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in
expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability
to make distributions to stockholders.

    Changes in the
Company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of
indebtedness.  The Company has adopted a policy of maintaining
a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to
maintain the Company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility.  The
Company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of
indebtedness that may be incurred.  If the Company changed this policy, the
Company could incur more debt, resulting in an increased risk of default on
our obligations and the obligations of the Operating Partnership, and an
increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.  Such increased debt could exceed the
underlying value of the Communities.
     
    The Company is
subject to various tax risks.  The Company has elected to be
taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC").  The
Company’s qualification as a REIT requires it to satisfy numerous requirements
(some on an annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and
complex IRC provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the Company’s
control.  Although the Company intends that its current organization
and method of operation enable it to qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot
assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified
in the future.  Future legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions (any of which could have retroactive effect)
could adversely impact the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely
affect its stockholders.  If it fails to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including
any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at corporate
rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in
computing its taxable income.  The Company may also be disqualified
from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which
it failed to qualify.  The additional tax liability would reduce its
net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders, and it
would no longer be required to make distributions to its
stockholders.  Even if the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it
will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its
income and property.
     
    The
Company has established several taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Despite
the Company’s qualification as a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay
U.S. federal income tax on their taxable income.  While the Company
will attempt to ensure that its dealing with its taxable REIT subsidiaries does
not adversely affect its REIT qualification, the Company cannot provide
assurance that it will successfully achieve that result.  Furthermore,
the Company may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, or its taxable REIT
subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent its dealings with its
taxable REIT subsidiaries’ are not deemed to be arm’s length in
nature.   No assurances can be given that the Company’s dealings
with its taxable REIT subsidiaries will be considered arm’s length in nature.
From time
to time, the Company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its
Communities. Under the IRC, any gain resulting from transfers of Communities
that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary
course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction
subject to a 100% penalty tax.  Since we acquire apartment communities
for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or
disposals of property are prohibited transactions.  However, whether
property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on
all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular
transaction.  The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain
transfers or disposals of apartment communities by us are prohibited
transactions.  If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue
successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited
transaction, then the Company would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any
gain allocable to the Company from the prohibited transaction and the Company’s
ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be
jeopardized.  Income from a prohibited transaction might adversely
affect the Company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a
REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Therefore, no assurances
can be given that the Company will be able to satisfy the income tests for
qualification as a REIT.
