(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




Anticipated Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply






In recognition of the changes in recent years in the wholesale power markets, PPL performed an in-depth analysis of its business mix to determine the best available opportunities to maximize the value of its competitive generation business for shareowners.  As a result, in June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy.  Under the terms of the agreements, at closing, PPL will spin off to PPL shareowners a newly formed entity, Talen Energy Holdings, Inc. (Holdco), which at such time will own all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.  Immediately following the spinoff, Holdco will merge with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply.  Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, RJS Power will be contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy.  Following completion of these transactions, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone will own 35%.  PPL will have no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or affiliation with Talen Energy and PPL's shareowners will receive a number of Talen Energy shares at closing based on the number of PPL shares owned as of the spinoff record date.  The spinoff will have no effect on the number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding.  The transaction is intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the NRC, FERC, DOJ and PUC.  In addition, there must be available, subject to certain conditions, at least $1 billion of undrawn credit capacity under a Talen Energy (or its subsidiaries) revolving credit or similar facility.  Any letters of credit or other credit support measures posted in connection with energy marketing and trading transactions at the time of the spinoff are excluded from this calculation.




On December 18, 2014, the FERC issued a final order approving, subject to certain market power mitigation requirements, the combination of the competitive generation assets to form Talen Energy.  On January 27, 2015, PPL and an affiliate of RJS Power filed a joint response with the FERC accepting additional market power mitigation measures required for the FERC's approval.  PPL and RJS Power originally proposed divesting either of two groups of assets each having approximately 1,300 MW of generating capacity.  PPL and RJS Power have agreed that within 12 months after closing of the transaction, Talen Energy will divest generating assets in one of the groups (from PPL Energy Supply's existing portfolio, this includes either the Holtwood and Wallenpaupack hydroelectric facilities or the Ironwood facility), and limit PJM energy market offers from assets it would retain in the other group to cost-based offers.






The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.  Talen Energy will own and operate a diverse mix of approximately 14,000 MW (after divestitures to meet FERC market power standards) of generating capacity in certain U.S. competitive energy markets primarily in PJM and ERCOT.

Following the transaction, PPL's focus will be on its regulated utility businesses in the U.K., Kentucky and Pennsylvania, serving more than 10 million customers.  PPL intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage its finances consistent with maintaining investment grade credit ratings and providing a competitive total shareowner return, including an attractive dividend.  Excluding costs required to provide transition services to Talen Energy and following the spinoff transaction, PPL expects to reduce annual ongoing corporate support costs by approximately $75 million.




See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




Montana Hydro Sale




In November 2014, PPL Montana completed the sale to NorthWestern of 633 MW of hydroelectric generating facilities located in Montana for approximately $900 million in cash.  The sale included 11 hydroelectric generating facilities and related assets.




See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




Distribution of PPL Global (PPL Energy Supply)




In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its entire membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding (the parent holding company of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Global with no other material operations), to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages these businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.  The distribution separated the U.S.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the U.K.-based regulated electricity distribution business.




Acquisitions




(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)




On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.  Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LG&E and KU Energy LLC.




(PPL)






On April 1, 2011, PPL, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, PPL WEM, acquired all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of Central Networks East plc and Central Networks Limited, the sole owner of Central Networks West plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as Central Networks and subsequently defined herein as WPD Midlands), from subsidiaries of E.ON AG.  WPD Midlands operates two regulated distribution networks in the Midlands area of England and is included in the U.K. Regulated segment.






Segment Information




(PPL)




PPL is organized into four reportable segments as depicted in the chart above:  U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated and Supply.  PPL's reportable segments primarily reflect the activities of its related Subsidiary Registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable Subsidiary Registrants.  The U.K. Regulated segment has no related Subsidiary Registrant.  Upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of PPL Energy Supply in the second quarter of 2015, PPL will no longer have a Supply segment.

The majority of WPD's utility revenue is known as DUoS and is from providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use the network to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users.




WPD's energy-related business revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business.







  

Franchise and Licenses







The operations of WPD's principal subsidiaries, WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands), are regulated by Ofgem under the direction of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority.  The Electricity Act 1989 provides the fundamental framework of electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the DNOs to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks.




WPD is authorized by Ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations.  For instance, WPD is subject to Ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.




Ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license.  In January 2014, Ofgem and WPD agreed to a reduction of £5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year to be recovered in the 2016/2017 regulatory year.  See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Distribution Revenue Reduction" for additional information.  In May 2014, Ofgem made license changes as part of the RIIO-ED1 process discussed below.




  



6







  













  

Competition







Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network.  WPD's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls.







  

Revenue and Regulation







Ofgem has established a price control mechanism that provides the amount of base demand revenue that a regulated business can earn and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets.  WPD is currently operating under DPCR5 which is effective for the period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015.




In October 2010, Ofgem announced changes to the regulatory framework that will be effective for the U.K. electricity distribution sector, including WPD, beginning April 2015.  Throughout the following discussion of this regulatory framework, the use of the term "customers" refers to the end-users of WPD's regulated distribution networks.  The framework, known as RIIO (Revenues = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), is intended to:

·      encourage DNOs to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers;

·      enable DNOs to finance the required investment in a timely and efficient way; and

·      remunerate DNOs according to their delivery for customers.




In addition to extending the price control period from five to eight years, the key components of RIIO-ED1 are:





  


·


increased emphasis on outputs and incentives;








  


·


enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers;








  


·


a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation;








  


·


replacement of the current Low Carbon Network Fund to continue to stimulate innovation;








  


·


depreciation of RAV for additions after April 1, 2015 will be extended from 20 years to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually change the life over the price control period that will result in an average life of 35 years for RAV additions during RIIO-ED1.  RAV at March 31, 2015 will continue to be depreciated over 20 years.  The asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for U.S. GAAP purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the RAV and as such vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets;








  


·


the ability for DNOs to be fast-tracked through the process, providing several benefits to the qualified DNOs, including the ability to collect the fast-track incentive, which is additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual expenditures during the 8-year price control period (approximately $43 million annually for WPD), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention; and








  


·


capital return comprised of a 10 year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, and an equity allowance determined by Ofgem with a debt to equity ratio of 65:35.  The real cost of equity determined by Ofgem for fast-tracked DNOs was 6.4% and 6.0% for slow-tracked DNOs and will be uplifted by inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index (RPI) to determine the nominal cost of equity.







In November 2013, Ofgem determined that the 8-year business plans of all four of WPD's DNOs were suitable for accelerated consideration or "fast tracking" and as a result merited early settlement of their price controls for the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period starting April 1, 2015.  This was confirmed in February 2014.




The U.K. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical U.S. regulatory structure which operates on a cost-recovery model.  The base demand revenue that a DNO can earn in each year of a price control period is the sum of:  (i) the regulator's determination of efficient operating costs, including certain pension deficit funding, (ii) a return on capital from RAV plus an annual adjustment for inflation as determined by the RPI, (iii) a return of capital from RAV (i.e. depreciation), (iv) an allowance for taxation less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage, (v) legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and (vi) certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control.  As WPD's four DNOs were fast-tracked through the price control review process for RIIO-ED1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above.  The RIIO-ED1 price control will also include an Annual Iteration Process. This will allow base demand revenues to be updated during the price control for financial adjustments covering tax, pension and cost of debt issues, adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the total cost incentive mechanism and the information quality incentive (IQI) discussed below, and legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods. This process calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "MOD."  RIIO-ED1 prices will be set using a forecast of RPI which is trued up 2 years later.




  



7







  










During DPCR5, WPD's total base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5% per year for all four DNOs.  In the first year of RIIO-ED1, base demand revenue will decrease by about 11.8% primarily due to a change in the profiling approach and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. For each regulatory year thereafter, base demand revenue will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for the remainder of RIIO-ED1.




In addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue.  The most significant of these are discussed below.




During the price control period, WPD's revenue is decoupled from volume.  However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period.  Conversely, WPD could also over-recover revenue.  Over and under-recoveries are added or subtracted to base demand revenue in future years.  Over and under-recovered amounts arising from 2014/15 onwards and refunded/recovered under RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year).  Therefore the 2014/15 over/ under-recovery adjustment will occur in 2016/17 instead of in 2015/16.  In 2016/17, WPD will recover the £5 per residential network customer reduction provided for in 2014/15 as that amount is currently considered an under-recovery. Under applicable U.S. GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries. WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




Ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service.  Some of the more significant incentive mechanisms include:








·


Information Quality Incentive (IQI) - The IQI is designed to incentivize the DNOs to provide good quality information in the business plans they submit to Ofgem during the price control review process and to execute their business plans as submitted.  The IQI eliminates the distinction between capital expenditure and operating expense and instead focuses on total expenditure:








  


·


DPCR5 - 85% of all network related expenditure is allocated to RAV and currently recovered over 20 years through the regulatory depreciation of RAV and 15% is recovered in the year of expenditure together with business support, non-operational capital expenditures and traffic management expenditures.  The IQI provides for incentives or penalties at the end of DPCR5 under the rolling RAV incentive mechanism based on the ratio of actual expenditures to the expenditures submitted to Ofgem that were the basis for the revenues allowed for the five-year price control period.  In addition, at the beginning of DPCR5, WPD was awarded $301 million in IQI revenue of which $222 million will be included in revenue throughout the current price control period with the balance recovered over 20 years through the RAV mechanism.








  


·


RIIO-ED1 - 80% of total costs will be allocated to RAV with 20% recovered in the year of expenditure.  As a result of being fast-tracked, WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends.  The cost incentive or penalty mechanism will be calculated each year on a 2 year lag basis as part of the annual MOD process discussed above.











·


Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS) - This incentive has two major components:  (1) Customer interruptions (CIs) and (2) Customer minutes lost (CMLs), and both are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.  During DPCR5 the target for each DNO is based on a benchmark of data from the last four years of the prior price control period. The IIS target under RIIO-ED1 will be divided into interruptions caused by planned and unplanned work.  The target for planned work will be calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes lost over a previous three year period.  The target for unplanned interruptions for the first year of RIIO-ED1 is specified in the DNO's license and targets for both the CIs and CMLs become more demanding each year.







·      In addition to the IIS, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced.  This broad measure encompasses:





  


·


customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries;








  


·


complaints;








  


·


stakeholder engagement; and








  


·


delivery of social obligations.

For regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19 allowed revenue will also be reduced to reflect Ofgem's final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism.  WPD has a liability recorded related to this future revenue reduction; therefore, this will not impact future earnings.  See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the U.K. Regulated Segment.







  

Customers







WPD provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers (its customers) who use the network to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users.  WPD bills the energy supplier for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing the end-users.  Ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement.  This agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize for its payment obligations.

Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)


  
  

  

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU.  In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment.







(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)




LG&E and KU, direct subsidiaries of LKE, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee.  LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky.  LG&E provides electric service to approximately 400,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 321,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky.  KU provides electric service to approximately 515,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, and fewer than ten customers in Tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles.  KU also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts.  In Virginia, KU operates under the name Old Dominion Power Company.





Details of operating revenues by customer class for the years ended December 31 are shown below.

(a)


Includes wholesale power and transmission revenues.








(b)


Includes intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, which are eliminated upon consolidation at LKE.











  

Franchises and Licenses







LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. 







  

Competition







There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LKE.  From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments.  Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky.  The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted.  Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation.  KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.




Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of LKE.  Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users.  LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability.  However, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.







  

Power Supply







At December 31, 2014, LKE owned, controlled or had a minority ownership interest in generating capacity (summer rating) of 8,087 MW, of which 3,342 MW related to LG&E and 4,745 MW related to KU, in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio.  See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of LKE's generating facilities.




The system capacity of LKE's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.




During 2014, LKE's Kentucky power plants generated the following amounts of electricity.

(a)


Includes 896 GWh of power generated by and purchased from OVEC for LKE, 620 GWh for LG&E and 276 GWh for KU.








(b)


This generation represents a 1.4% increase for LKE, a 5.4% increase for LG&E and a 1.6% decrease for KU from 2013 output.








A majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base.




LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers.  When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E.  When KU has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail and municipal customers and its generation cost is lower than that of LG&E, LG&E purchases electricity from KU.




See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for additional information regarding LG&E's and KU's Cane Run Unit 7 which is currently under construction, and LG&E's and KU's CPCN application to construct a solar generating facility at the E.W. Brown generating site.  As a result of environmental requirements, LG&E and KU anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the Cane Run plant in 2015 and the Green River plant in 2016, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 724 MW.  In addition, KU retired the remaining 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in February 2013 and retired a 12 MW gas-fired unit at the Haefling plant in December 2013.







  

Fuel Supply







Coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E and KU for baseload generation for the foreseeable future.  However, natural gas will play a more significant role starting in 2015 when Cane Run Unit 7 is expected to be placed into operation as baseload generation.  The natural gas for this generating unit will be contracted from suppliers separately from LG&E's natural gas customers.  Natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.




Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units.  Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.  To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving the new NGCC unit at Cane Run and six simple cycle combustion turbine units.




LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2019 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.




For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Illinois.  In 2015 and beyond, LG&E and KU may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at TC2.  Coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail.




(PPL, LKE and LG&E)







  

Natural Gas Distribution Supply







Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 Bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers.  By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads.  Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season.  Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest.  Several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas.  At December 31, 2014, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $54 million.




LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations.  These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive.  In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.




  



11







  










LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines.  LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2015 and 2020.  Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 194,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 88,000 MMBtu/day.  Additionally, LG&E has a contract with the same pipeline for the month of January 2015 with a total capacity of 35,000 MMBtu/day, and a contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in October 2018.




LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Rockies, Marcellus and Utica production areas.




(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)







  

Transmission







LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission operator.




In February 2013, LG&E and KU submitted a compliance filing to the FERC reflecting their participation with other utilities in the Southeastern Regional Transmission Planning group relating to certain FERC Order 1000 requirements.  FERC Order 1000, issued in July 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. 







  

Rates







LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC, the VSCC and the TRA.  LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff (OATT).




LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means.  As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.




KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets.




KU's rates to 12 municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets.  In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts.  Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date.  In addition, a tenth municipality has a previously settled termination date of 2016.




See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.




Rate Case




On November 26, 2014, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $30 million at LG&E and approximately $153 million at KU and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $14 million at LG&E.  The proposed base rate increases would result in electricity rate increases of 2.7% at LG&E and 9.6% at KU and a gas rate increase of 4.2% at LG&E and would become effective in July 2015.  LG&E's and KU's applications each include a request for authorized returns-on-equity of 10.5%.  The applications are based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.  A number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings.  A hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on April 21, 2015.  LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations







PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC.  PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions.  In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.







  

Competition







Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area.  Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business.  Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.




The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.







  

Rates and Regulation







Transmission




PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.




PJM serves as a FERC-approved RTO to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves.  In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.  A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets.  Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities.  Certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.




As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM in accordance with a FERC approved tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula rate mechanism.  As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM.  See "PLR" below.




  



13







  










See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms.




Distribution 




PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC.  Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only regulatory assets earning a return.  Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.




Pennsylvania's AEPS requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from alternative energy sources.  Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.




Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.




Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC.  Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets.  In January 2013, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a DSIC.  In May 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's proposed DSIC with an initial rate effective July 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings.  The PUC also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the Office of Administrative Law Judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision.  In August 2014, the presiding Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended decision which would not have a significant impact on PPL Electric.  This matter remains pending before the PUC.




See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129, Act 11 and other legislative and regulatory impacts.




PLR




The Customer Choice Act requires Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs), including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to regulations established by the PUC.  As of December 31, 2014, the following percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers:  50% of residential, 83% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers.  The PUC continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity.  See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.




PPL Electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process.  The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2013 through May 2015, which includes 4 solicitations for electricity supply held in April and October, annually.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from PPL Electric.  These solicitations include a mix of 12- and 9-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and large industrial customers to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.  In April 2014, PPL Electric filed a new Default Service Plan with the PUC for the period of June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017.  The petition was approved by the PUC on January 15, 2015.




Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service territory.  Since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.  See "Energy Purchase Commitments" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL Electric's solicitations.

Consists primarily of the activities of PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries, PPL Generation and PPL EnergyPlus.  PPL Generation owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects.  PPL EnergyPlus markets and trades electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products in competitive wholesale and retail markets.  In addition, certain financing and other costs are allocated to the Supply segment.  Upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of PPL Energy Supply in 2015, PPL will no longer have a Supply segment.  See "Anticipated Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply" above for additional information.







(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




PPL Energy Supply's generation assets are primarily located in Pennsylvania and Montana.  PPL Energy Supply enters into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with its generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes.  PPL EnergyPlus sells the electricity produced by PPL Energy Supply's generation plants based on prevailing market rates.  PPL Energy Supply's total expected generation in 2015 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales.  PPL Energy Supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for 2016 and beyond.

PPL Energy Supply's generation subsidiaries are EWGs that sell electricity into wholesale markets.  EWGs are subject to regulation by the FERC, which has authorized these EWGs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices.  This electricity is sold to PPL EnergyPlus under FERC-jurisdictional power purchase agreements.  PPL Susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of the Susquehanna nuclear units.  Certain of PPL Energy Supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices.  Certain operations of PPL Generation's subsidiaries are also subject to OSHA and comparable state statutes.







  

Fuel Supply







Coal




Pennsylvania




PPL EnergyPlus actively manages PPL Energy Supply's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in northern Appalachia.




During 2014, PPL Generation purchased 5.6 million tons of coal required for its wholly owned Pennsylvania plants.  Coal inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units.  Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.  PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, has agreements in place that will provide more than 16 million tons of PPL Generation's projected coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2015 through 2018 and augments its coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.




A PPL Generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the Keystone plant and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh plant.  PPL Generation owns a 12.34% interest in Keystone Fuels, LLC and a 16.25% interest in Conemaugh Fuels, LLC.  The Keystone plant contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for its coal requirements, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the Keystone plant in 2014.  The Conemaugh plant requirements are purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the Conemaugh plant in 2014.




All wholly owned PPL Generation coal plants within Pennsylvania are equipped with scrubbers, which use limestone in their operations.  Acting as agent for PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus has entered into limestone contracts with suppliers that will provide for those plants' requirements through 2016.  During 2014, 430,000 tons of limestone were delivered to Brunner Island and Montour under these contracts.  Annual limestone requirements range from approximately 400,000-500,000 tons.




Montana




PPL Montana owns a 30% interest in Colstrip Unit 3 and NorthWestern owns a 30% interest in Colstrip Unit 4.  PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement that governs each party's responsibilities and rights relating to the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4.  Under the terms of that agreement, each party is responsible for 15% of the total non-coal operating and construction costs of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, regardless of whether a particular cost is specific to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4 and is entitled to take up to 15% of the available generation from Units 3 and 4.  Each party is responsible for its own coal costs.  PPL Montana, with the other Colstrip owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications.  PPL Montana, with the other Colstrip Units 1 and 2 owner, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for Units 1 and 2, which provides these units 85% to 100% of their coal requirements (at owners' option) from January 2015 through December 2019.  PPL Montana, with the other Colstrip Units 3 and 4 owners, has a long-term coal supply contract for Units 3 and 4, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through December 2019.




These units were originally built containing scrubbers and PPL Montana has entered into a long-term contract to purchase the limestone requirements for these units.  The contract extends through December 2030.




Coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette plant.  The contracts covered 100% of the plant's coal requirements in 2014 and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through the suspension of plant operations scheduled for no later than April 2015.  The plant is expected to be retired in August 2015.

Oil and Natural Gas




Pennsylvania




PPL Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas.  During 2014, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased on the spot market using either delivered supply or a combination of spot market supply and short-term capacity and oil requirements were supplied from inventory and replenished by purchases made in the spot market.  At December 31, 2014, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units.




Short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 38% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel combined-cycle facility.




For PPL's Ironwood combined-cycle facility, PPL EnergyPlus has long-term transportation contracts that can deliver up to approximately 25% of Ironwood's maximum daily gas requirements.  Daily gas requirements can also be met through a combination of short-term transportation capacity release transactions coupled with upstream supply.




In addition, PPL EnergyPlus has secured long-term natural gas supply for approximately 10% of the combined needs of Ironwood and Lower Mt. Bethel through 2016.




Nuclear




The nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.




PPL Susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services.  These contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2020 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2019.  PPL Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units.




Federal law requires the U.S. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational.  As a result, it was necessary to expand Susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity.  To support this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology.  The facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed.  The facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999.  PPL Susquehanna estimates, under current operating conditions, that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017.  If necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through 2044, the current licensed life of the plant.




In 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998.  In January 2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  In May 2011, PPL Susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Government relating to PPL Susquehanna's lawsuit.  The settlement included reimbursement of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the Susquehanna plant incurred from 1998 through December 31, 2013, and PPL Susquehanna received payments for its claimed costs for those periods.  In exchange, PPL Susquehanna waived any claims against the U.S. Government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the Susquehanna plant through December 31, 2013.  In January 2014, PPL Susquehanna entered into a new agreement with the DOE to extend the settlement agreement on the same terms as the prior agreement for an additional three years to the end of 2016.

Energy Marketing







PPL EnergyPlus sells the capacity and electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, and buys and sells purchased power, capacity, ancillary services, FTRs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and RECs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets.




PPL EnergyPlus transacts in competitive retail energy markets, and buys and sells electricity and natural gas supply, to meet the diverse needs of business customers.  PPL EnergyPlus sells retail electricity supply to business customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania and sells retail natural gas supply to business customers in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  The company also offers electricity supply to select residential customers in Pennsylvania.  Although retail energy revenues continue to grow, the net margins related to these activities are not currently a significant component of PPL Energy Supply's margins.




Within the constraints of its hedging policy, PPL EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations.  See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for more information.







  

Competition







Since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in U.S. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives.  Although some states, such as Pennsylvania and Montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industries.  Some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration.  In addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers.  Interest in re-regulation, however, has slowed due to recent declining power prices.  As such, the markets in which PPL Energy Supply participates are highly competitive.




PPL Energy Supply faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services.  Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, governmental mandates for new generation, new market entrants, construction of new generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  PPL Energy Supply primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  Competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, NUGs, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Supply Segment", "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" and Notes 13 and 17 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets.







  

Franchise and Licenses







See "Energy Marketing" above for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses in various states.  PPL EnergyPlus has a license from the DOE to export electric energy to Canada.  PPL EnergyPlus also has a permit from the National Energy Board of Canada to export firm and interruptible energy from Canada to the U.S.




PPL Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating licenses that expire in 2042 for Unit 1 and in 2044 for Unit 2.




In 2008, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary, PPL Bell Bend, LLC, submitted a COLA to the NRC for a new nuclear generating unit (Bell Bend) to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna plant.  Also in 2008, the COLA was formally docketed and accepted for review by the NRC.  PPL Bell Bend, LLC does not expect to complete the COLA review process with the NRC prior to 2018.  See Note 8 to Financial Statements for additional information.




PPL Holtwood operates the Holtwood and Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating plants pursuant to FERC-granted licenses that expire in 2030 and 2045, respectively.

Other Corporate Functions (PPL)







PPL Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, supply chain, human resources and information technology services.  Most of PPL Services' costs are charged directly to the respective PPL subsidiaries for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees.




Upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and any related transition services to Talen Energy, the remaining corporate functions that would be provided by PPL Services would primarily be in support of PPL Electric.  As a result, a newly created centralized services company has been formed, PPL EU Services, which will provide the majority of corporate functions such as financial, supply chain, human resources and information technology services to PPL Electric.  Significant portions of the various corporate functions within PPL Services will be transferred to PPL EU Services during 2015 and 2016 as the transition services agreements with Talen Energy expire.  Most of PPL EU Services' costs will be charged directly to PPL Electric for the services provided, with limited amounts charged back to PPL Services and its affiliates.  PPL Services will continue to provide certain limited corporate functions, as the size of the organization is being reduced from approximately 1,200 employees to less than 200 employees after the transition services with Talen Energy are complete.




PPL Capital Funding, PPL's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries.  PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that further enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies.  As a result, PPL plans to further utilize PPL Capital Funding in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies.




Unlike PPL Services and PPL EU Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries.  Costs are charged directly to PPL.  However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments.  The associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance.  The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances in 2013 and beyond, with certain exceptions including the remarketing of the debt component of the 2010 and 2011 Equity Units, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.




See "Anticipated Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply" above for information on the expected reductions of $75 million in corporate support costs in connection with the spinoff transaction.





(All Registrants)




SEASONALITY






The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather.  As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned, the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity.  See "Financial Condition - Environmental Matters" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding climate change.








FINANCIAL CONDITION

concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2015 through 2019.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters.






ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS






The Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters.  The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electricity industry.  These initiatives cover air, water and waste.  See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2015-2019.  Also, see "Environmental Matters" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  To comply with environmental requirements, PPL's forecast for environmental capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years.  Such projections are $2.4 billion for PPL, including $2.2 billion for LKE ($1.1 billion each for LG&E and KU), and $192 million for PPL Energy Supply.  Actual costs (including capital, emission allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final compliance requirements and market conditions.  PPL's and LKE's subsidiaries may also incur capital expenditures and operating expenses, which are not now determinable, but could be significant.  Most environmental compliance costs incurred by LG&E and KU are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism.  See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS






The Registrants face various risks associated with their businesses.  Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results.




As used in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply segment discussions, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Regulated segment discussion, or LKE and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Kentucky Regulated segment discussion.




(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




Risks Relating to Our Agreement to Spin off PPL Energy Supply and Form Talen Energy Corporation




The proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and the combination with RJS Power are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions and may present situations that could have an adverse effect on us.




The proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and the subsequent combination with RJS Power to form Talen Energy are complex transactions, subject to various conditions, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions.  On November 5, 2014, Talen Energy filed a registration statement with the SEC containing detailed information regarding Talen Energy.  Completion of the proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and subsequent combination with RJS Power will be contingent upon a number of factors, including that (i) PPL receives a favorable legal opinion of tax counsel as described below; (ii) the SEC declares effective Talen Energy's registration statement relating to registration of Talen Energy common stock and no SEC stop order suspending effectiveness of the registration statement be in effect prior to the PPL Energy Supply spinoff; (iii) the Talen Energy common stock be authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange; (iv) certain regulatory approvals have been obtained, including approval by the NRC and the FERC, Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance and certain approvals by the PUC and (v)  there be, subject to certain conditions, at least $1 billion of undrawn credit capacity under a revolving credit facility or similar facility available to Talen Energy and its subsidiaries (for purposes of which any letters of credit or other credit support measures posted in connection with energy marketing and trading transactions then outstanding shall not be considered as drawn against such facility).  The spinoff and subsequent combination may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties or subject to certain other circumstances, including the failure to complete these transactions by June 30, 2015 or, if the required regulatory approvals have not been obtained at such time but the other conditions to the consummation of these transactions have been or are capable of being satisfied, December 31, 2015.  For these and other reasons, the spinoff and subsequent combination may not be completed on the terms or within the expected timeframe, if at all.




If the proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Sections 355 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of PPL or Talen Energy, then PPL and/or its shareowners may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.




Among other requirements, the completion of the proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and subsequent combination with RJS Power is conditioned upon PPL's receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(D) and a tax-free distribution pursuant to Section 355 of the Code.  Although receipt of such legal opinion will satisfy a condition to completion of the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion will not be binding on the IRS.  Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions that are different from the conclusions reached in such opinion.  PPL is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the factual statements or representations on which the legal opinion will be based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff.  If, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the IRS were to determine the Distribution to be taxable, PPL would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be substantial.  In addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the IRS were to determine the Merger to be taxable, PPL shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be material.








  



21







  








In addition, the spinoff will be taxable to PPL pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either PPL or Talen Energy, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff.  Because PPL's shareowners will collectively own more than 50% of Talen Energy's common stock following the spinoff and subsequent combination, the combination alone will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to PPL under Section 355(e) of the Code.  However, Section 355(e) of the Code might apply if acquisitions of stock of PPL before or after the spinoff, or of Talen Energy after the combination, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff.  PPL is not aware of any such plan or series of transactions that include the spinoff.




PPL may not be successful in realizing the full amount of anticipated annual savings as a result of the proposed spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.




In connection with the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, and following any required transition services period, PPL is targeting to reduce its annual corporate support costs by an estimated $185 million.  This includes $110 million of corporate support costs to be either eliminated or transferred to Talen Energy and $75 million of corporate support costs to be eliminated as a result of workforce and other corporate cost reductions.  If for any reason PPL cannot realize all or a significant portion of the $75 million corporate cost savings it could have an adverse effect on PPL's cash flows and results of operations.




Risks related to our U.K. Segment




Our U.K. distribution business contributes more than 50% of PPL's total annual net income and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the U.S., including risks associated with changes in U.K. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the U.K. government and the European Union.  These risks may reduce the results of operations from our U.K. distribution business or affect our ability to access U.K. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the U.S.










·


changes in laws or regulations relating to U.K. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws and regulations;








·


changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements;








·


changes in general economic conditions affecting the U.K.;








·


regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies;








·


changes in labor relations;








·


limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors;








·


limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans;








·


changes in U.S. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; and








·


compliance with U.S. foreign corrupt practices laws.









We are subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a majority of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our U.K. business operations.




These risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar between the time we initially invest U.S. dollars in our U.K. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the U.S. from the U.K., including cash flows from our U.K. businesses that may be distributed to PPL or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes.  In addition, PPL's consolidated reported earnings on a U.S. GAAP basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our U.K. businesses on a British pound sterling basis to a U.S. dollar basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP requirements.




Our U.K. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance.




Our U.K. delivery businesses are rate-regulated and operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework.  Managing operational risk is critical to the U.K. Regulated segment's financial performance.  Disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that Ofgem administers relating to customer service levels.








  



22







  








A failure by any of our U.K. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by Ofgem that could have an adverse impact on PPL.




Ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked.  Ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the U.K. regulated businesses and PPL.




(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE)




Risk Related to Registrant Holding Companies




PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and LKE's cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and PPL's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries.




PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries.  Substantially all of the consolidated assets of these Registrants are held by their subsidiaries.  Accordingly, these Registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as PPL's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances.  The subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment.  The ability of the Registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to pay dividends under Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act.




Because PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries.  Although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities.  Therefore, PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and LKE's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of any debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors.  In addition, if PPL elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, PPL may incur U.S. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts.




(All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply)




Risks Related to Domestic Regulated Utility Operations




Our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the Kentucky Regulated segment and the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.  Set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments.




Our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments.  Regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged.




The rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, TRA and PUC.  Although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments.  Federal or state agencies, interveners and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit our current rates or future rates we seek.  Although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or based on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs





  



23







  








at any given time.  Our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators.  If our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.




Our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation.




In addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including:










·


the terms and conditions of our service and operations;








·


financial and capital structure matters;








·


siting, construction and operation of facilities;








·


mandatory reliability and safety standards under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other standards of conduct;








·


accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies;








·


tax matters;








·


affiliate transactions;








·


acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and








·


various other matters, including energy efficiency.









Such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers.




Changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues.




Wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity.  Changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not predictable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues.  These can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which our domestic utilities participate.




Our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs.




The domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of LG&E and KU) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability.  The completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including:










·


approval, licensing and permitting;








·


land acquisition and the availability of suitable land;








·


skilled labor or equipment shortages;








·


construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors;








·


increases in commodity prices or labor rates;








·


contractor performance;








·


environmental considerations and regulations;








·


weather and geological issues; and








·


political, labor and regulatory developments.









Failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators.




We are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years.




PPL is experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers.








  



24







  








Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment




(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)




The costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes.




Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to LG&E's and KU's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material.  In addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed.  Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operations changes, permit limitations or other restrictions.  At some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units.  Market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis.  Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services.




Ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties.




The environmental standards governing LG&E's and KU's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to ongoing rulemakings and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation.  Revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans.  Depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals.  Under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation.




Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment




(PPL and PPL Electric)




We plan to selectively pursue growth of transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.




We plan to pursue expansion of our transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years.  We plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure.  These types of projects involve numerous risks.  With respect to the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.  Expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes.  The success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals.  If we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project.




We face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth




FERC Order 1000, issued in July 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities.  The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.  Increased competition can result in lower rate base growth.





  



25







  











We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to Pennsylvania Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs.




PPL Electric is subject to Act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing AEPS.  The law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand.  Utilities not meeting these Act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates.  Numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us.




Risks Related to Supply Segment




(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)




We face intense competition in the competitive power generation market, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow.




Our generation business is dependent on our ability to operate successfully in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a regulated rate structure.  Competition is affected by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  These competitive factors may negatively affect our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we receive for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business.




We sell our available energy and capacity into competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration.  Competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, reliability and availability.  We believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electricity generating facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on electricity and capacity prices.




We also face competition in the wholesale markets for generation capacity and ancillary services.  We primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities, ISOs and RTOs.  We also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have.




Competitors in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and financial institutions.

 

We are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale and retail electricity markets.




We purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based rates throughout the U.S.  and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations.  If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages.  These damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity.  Depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity.




Our wholesale power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  We currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts.  However, our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities





  



26







  








could be limited by financial markets or other factors.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of credit facilities.




We also face credit risk that counterparties with whom we contract in both the wholesale and retail markets will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the inception of the contract.  Whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  However, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, including bankruptcy, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages.




Adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.




Our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, RECs, electricity capacity and related congestion charges and other costs.  Unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electricity requires that it must be consumed at the time of production.  As a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short time periods and can be unpredictable.  Among the factors that influence such prices are:










·


demand for electricity;








·


supply of electricity available from current or new generation resources;








·


variable production costs, primarily fuel (and associated transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity;








·


transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served;








·


changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets;








·


liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and








·


weather and economic conditions affecting demand for or the price of electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity.









Our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs.




We actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt and counterparty credit positions.  We have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics.  Nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned.  For example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations.  Additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions.  We enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery.  Similarly, interest rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address.  As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position.




In addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk.  We have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk.  However, if counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.  In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected.




We do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility.




We attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts.  We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities.  However, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations





  



27







  








from commodity price risk.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk and applicable commodity prices change in ways that would be adverse to us, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.  To the extent we do hedge against commodity price risk, those hedges may not ultimately prove to be effective.




The accounting for our hedging activities may increase the volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results.




We engage in commodity-related marketing and price-risk management activities in order to physically and financially hedge our exposure to market risk with respect to electricity sales from our generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission allowances.




We generally attempt to balance our fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.  These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or the NPNS exception.  Whether a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative.  Specific criteria are also required in order to elect the NPNS exception, which permits qualifying hedges to be treated under the accrual accounting method.  All economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or the NPNS exception, or we may elect not to utilize cash flow hedge accounting or the NPNS exception.  As a result, our quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.




Changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants.




A basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices.  There are alternate technologies to supply electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, batteries, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns.  Research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies.  It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternative generation to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production.  Also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators.  These alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants.  As a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced.




The full-requirements sales contracts that PPL EnergyPlus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins.




We generally hedge our full-requirements sales contracts with our own generation or energy purchases from third parties.  If the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss.  Alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of full-requirements sales contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market.  Therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared with our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.




We may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities.




We purchase fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals) from a number of suppliers.  Delivery of these fuels to our facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties as well as the infrastructure (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways, riverways and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation facility.  As a result, we are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at our generation facilities if fuel is unavailable at any price or if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.  Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations.





  



28







  











Unforeseen changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause us to incur excess coal inventories and contract termination costs.




Extraordinarily low natural gas prices could cause natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity.  Because we enter into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate our base load coal-fired generating facilities, we may experience periods where we hold excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in our reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities in favor of operating available alternative natural gas-fired generating facilities.  In addition, we may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of our generating requirements.




If the services provided by the transmission facilities that deliver the wholesale power from our generation facilities are inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected.  Furthermore, any changes in the structure and operation of, or the various pricing limitations imposed by, the RTOs and ISOs that operate these transmission facilities may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities.




We do not own or control the transmission facilities required to sell the wholesale power from our generation facilities.  If the transmission service from these facilities is unavailable or disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected.  RTOs and ISOs provide transmission services, administer transparent and competitive power markets and maintain system reliability.  Many of these RTOs and ISOs operate in the real-time and day ahead markets in which we sell energy.  The RTOs and ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, offer caps and other mechanisms to guard against the potential exercise of market power in these markets as well as price limitations.  These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.  Problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of maturing RTOs and similar market structures, or changes in geographic scope, rules or market operations of existing RTOs, may also affect our ability to sell, the prices we receive or the cost to transmit power produced by our generating facilities.  Rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time, which could affect our costs or revenues. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.




The FERC has issued regulations that require wholesale electricity transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis.  Although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require.  We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs and RTOs in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services.




Because our generation facilities are part of interconnected regional grids, we face the risk of blackout due to a disruption on a neighboring interconnected system.




Major electric power blackouts are possible and have occurred, which could disrupt electrical service for extended periods of time.  If a blackout were to occur, the impact could result in interruptions to our operations, increased costs to replace existing contractual obligations, the possibility of regulatory investigations and potential operational risks to our facilities.  Additionally, in response to the blackout, there could be changes or developments in applicable regulations or market structures that could have longer-term impact on our business and results of operations.




Despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our generation business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities.




Our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market.  Generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC.  The FERC has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.  The FERC retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates.  Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  See "Regulatory Issues - FERC Market-Based Rate Authority" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's market-based rate authority program.





  



29







  











In addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs.




Our costs to comply with existing and new environmental and related worker health and safety laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity or cause the continued operation of certain generation facilities to be uneconomic.




Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety.  Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly response actions.  These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of hazardous materials from our operations, the imposition of specific standards addressing worker protection, and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution or contamination resulting from our operations.  To comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance.  Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in joint and several, strict liability for administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations.  Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws, regulations and permits or for personal injury or property damage.




Our operations also pose risks of environmental liability due to leakage, migration, releases or spills of hazardous substances to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater.  Certain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability (that could result in an entity paying more than its fair share) for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or solid wastes have been stored or released.  We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.  In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.




The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the power generation industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability.  Many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions, water discharge and intake requirements, and management of CCRs as not being sufficiently strict.  As a result, state and federal regulations have been proposed or adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions, which could require us to significantly increase capital and operating expenditures for additional environmental controls.  At some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary environmental controls to comply with new or proposed regulations, which could cause us to retire those units.




We may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs.




We are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life.




Nuclear generation accounted for about 32% of PPL Energy Supply's 2014 competitive power generation output.  The risks of nuclear generation generally include:





  



30







  














·


the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;








·


limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and








·


uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.  The licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the ARO related to the decommissioning.









The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  In addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, particularly in response to the 2011 incident in Fukushima, Japan, could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.  There also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to us that cannot be predicted.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance.




We plan to optimize our competitive power generation operations, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.




We plan to optimize our competitive power generation operations.  We plan to do this through the construction of new power plants or modification of existing power plants, and the potential closure of certain existing plants and acquisition of plants that may become available for sale.  These types of projects involve numerous risks.  Any planned power plant modifications could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs.  With respect to the construction of new plants or modification of existing plants, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.  The success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals.  If we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project.  Furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or modified plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings.




Risks Related to All Segments




(All Registrants)




The operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk.




Numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems.  The operation of our generation plants, including the Susquehanna nuclear plant, and of our energy and fuel trading businesses, as well as our transmission and distribution operations are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events.  As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damages to our reputation.




Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




Adverse economic conditions and the declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, have significantly impacted our earnings.  The breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. business environment, including our businesses.  In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for electricity and natural gas and/or reduce our customers' ability to pay their bills.  This reduced demand continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as PJM) and our Pennsylvania and Kentucky utility businesses.  The combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy





  



31







  








markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results.  In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact our unhedged future energy margins, utility profits, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition.




Increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and self-generation, which may adversely impact our business.




Energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies.  Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers.  This focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could in turn adversely affect our business.




A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt.




Credit ratings assigned by Moody's and S&P to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses.  A ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates.  See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ratings Triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings.




Disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




Our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and access to capital, among other things, for financing capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business.  Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and Basel III in Europe may impose costly additional requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract, such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent.




We could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets.




In the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs.  As a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes.  Changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit.




Our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions.




Our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles.  For example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months.  As a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur.  The patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity.




Operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters.




Weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs.  Storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs.




Our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change.




Climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity.  In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change,





  



32







  








such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects.  These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs.  Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies.  Reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver.  Also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.




We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities.  An adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "Federal Matters" in Note 6 and "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues" and "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case.




Significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity.




We continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses.  However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations.  Increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors.  In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees.  We provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees.  These benefits give rise to significant expenses.  Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits.  In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees.  The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control.  These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants.  If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly.




We may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings.




Under GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.  Although no impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary.




We also review our long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  See Notes 1 and 16 to the Financial Statements for additional information on impairment charges taken and analysis performed during the reporting periods.  We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years.




We may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations.




In connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities.  These indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture.  See "Guarantees and Other Assurances" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements.





  



33







  











We are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations.




The conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties.




Our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance.




Operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels.  These events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses.  Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers.  Planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them.




Although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur.




We are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations.




Changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations.  We are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities.  These tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes.  We also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits.  Due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered.  We cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses.  If enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.




We are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals.




We are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive.  In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances.  Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions.  Although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action.




Our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows.  In addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations.  In addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.




War, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business.




War, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas.  Instability and unrest in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Iraq, as well as threats of war or other armed conflict elsewhere, may cause further disruption to





  



34







  








financial and commercial markets and contribute to even higher levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas.  In addition, unrest in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Iraq could lead to acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours.  Armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future.  In addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.
