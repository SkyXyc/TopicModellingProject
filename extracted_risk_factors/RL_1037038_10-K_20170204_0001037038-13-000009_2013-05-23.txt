 — “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.”17 DistributionTo facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to retail and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:Geographic Region  Facility Type Facility Location FacilityOwnershipU.S.  Wholesale and Retail distribution center Greensboro, North Carolina Owned   Wholesale distribution center High Point, North Carolina Leased   E-commerce distribution center High Point, North Carolina(1) Leased   Distribution center Chino Hills, California Third-party   Distribution center Miami, Florida Third-partyCanada  Distribution center Toronto, Ontario Third-partyEurope  Distribution center Parma, Italy(2) Third-partyJapan  Distribution center Yokohama, Japan(3) Third-partySouth Korea  Distribution center Bugok, South Korea LeasedGreater China and Southeast Asia(4)  Distribution centers Hong Kong, China, Singapore,Malaysia, and Taiwan Third-partyLatin America  Distribution centers Uruguay and Panama Third-party(1) This distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for RalphLauren.com and ClubMonaco.com. In October 2012, we entered into an agreement to purchase and expand this distribution center, which is expected to be completed in September 2013. (2) This distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our European businesses, including our e-commerce operations in Europe.(3) This distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our Japanese businesses, including our e-commerce operations in Japan.(4) Includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.Management Information SystemsOur management information systems make the design, marketing, manufacturing, importing, and distribution of our products more efficient by providing, among other things:•comprehensive order processing;•production and design information;•accounting information; and•an enterprise view of information for our design, marketing, manufacturing, importing, and distribution functions.The point-of-sale registers in conjunction with other systems in our stores enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers and software programs, allow for stock replenishment, effective merchandise planning, and real-time inventory and sales accounting. In the U.S. and Europe, we utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our Retail segment and wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.18 In the U.S. and Europe, we also utilize an automated allocation system to facilitate the flow of inventory for our Retail segment.We are in the process of implementing a new global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. The implementation of this global system, scheduled to occur in phases over the next several years, began with the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems during Fiscal 2011 and continued with the transition of certain of our domestic operational and financial systems to the new global operating and financial reporting system during Fiscal 2012. During Fiscal 2013, we continued to develop and enhance those operational and financial systems previously transitioned to the new global operating and financial reporting system. The next phase of this implementation effort involves the migration of certain core areas of our business to the new system, including global merchandise procurement, and customer order management and record-to-report for our North American wholesale operations, beginning in Fiscal 2014. See  — “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our business could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our customers.”Wholesale BacklogWe generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers. Such orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights. Our total backlog was approximately $1.4 billion as of March 30, 2013 and March 31, 2012. We expect that substantially all of our backlog orders as of March 30, 2013 will be filled within the next fiscal year. The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year to year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the basic stock replenishment programs usage. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.TrademarksWe own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO BY RALPH LAUREN DESIGN, and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we similarly own include:•PURPLE LABEL;•BLACK LABEL;•BLUE LABEL;•RRL;•LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;•PINK PONY;19 •RLX;•DENIM & SUPPLY RALPH LAUREN;•LAUREN;•RALPH;•CHAPS;•CLUB MONACO;•RUGBY; •AMERICAN LIVING; and•Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly-owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition, Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly-owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see  — “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor, or a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.”Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission, including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes limitations on the permissible amounts of lead and phthalates allowed in children's products. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing, and product safety particularly with respect to products used by children. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.        We are also subject to new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain “conflict minerals” under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations.Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.EmployeesAs of March 30, 2013, we had approximately 23,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 full-time and approximately 9,000 part-time employees. Approximately 14,000 of our employees are located in the U.S. and approximately 9,000 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 30 of our U.S. production and distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of Amalgamated Ladies Garment Cutters Union, Local 10 UNITE (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.21 Executive OfficersThe following are our current executive officers and their principal recent business experience: Ralph Lauren  Age 73  Mr. Lauren has been Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company since prior to the Company’s initial public offering in 1997, and was a member of the Advisory Board of the board of directors of the Company’s predecessors since their organization.

He was Senior Vice President of Human Resources of Conseco, Inc. from February 2000 to July 2000. Prior to that time, Mr. Kosh held executive human resource positions with the Venator Group, Inc. starting in 1996.22 Item 1A.Risk Factors There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our results of operations, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading prices of our securities, and/or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods or if circumstances change.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren, members of our executive management, or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing, and operational areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our Company. Mr. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with Mr. Lauren’s name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. We depend on the service and management experience of Mr. Lauren and other key executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business. The death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The loss of the services of Mr. Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, or one or more of our other key personnel, or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive officers, and certain other members of senior management. We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and other executive officers, but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to Mr. Lauren and certain other executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands and merchandise categories, expand our geographic coverage, and increase direct management of our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically acquiring or integrating select businesses previously held by our licensees, and enhancing our operations. Implementation of our strategy involves the continued expansion of our business in North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and other international areas. For example, as discussed in Item 1 — “Business — Recent Developments,” in April 2013, we completed the Chaps men's sportswear license acquisition, and we are in the process of repositioning and upgrading our existing distribution network in the Asia-Pacific region. We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we acquire into our own business, incur additional costs, and/or fail to achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our retail distribution network on a global basis, including our e-commerce operations, which is subject to many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to procure, purchase, or lease desirable freestanding or department store locations, renew, and maintain existing freestanding store leases and department store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable replacement locations. The lease negotiation, as well as the number and timing of new stores and shop-within-shop locations actually opened during any given period and their associated contribution to net income for the period, depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our ability and our landlords’ ability to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our stores on a timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the construction and development costs of new stores; (v) the rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises; (vi) adverse weather conditions during the construction period; and (vii) the hiring and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market. While we continue to explore new markets and are always evaluating new potential locations, any of the above 23 factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e-commerce sites are introduced may decline due to cannibalization.In Europe, we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing and maintaining successful distribution strategies and alliances in certain of the major European countries. In Asia, our primary mode of distribution is via a network of shops located within leading department stores. As we have limited experience operating a direct-to-consumer business in this region and face established competitors, we may have difficulty in successfully retaining this network and expanding into alternate distribution channels. In addition, certain of the international countries in which we operate, particularly in Asia, have unique operational characteristics that vary from the U.S., including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, acquiring store locations, and legal requirements, which may pose challenges to the execution and success of our related growth strategies. Further, macroeconomic trends may not be favorable and could limit our ability to implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we have foreign operations, such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America.Achievement of our growth strategy requires investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies worldwide. These investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. In addition, we may continue to incur costs in connection with repositioning our business in certain geographic areas, including in the Asia-Pacific region. Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized.Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various international locations. These include:•the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;•compliance with U.S. and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;•unexpected changes in laws, judicial process, or regulatory requirements; and•new tariffs or other barriers in certain international markets.We are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:•political instability and terrorist attacks;•changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and•general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, or economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business.We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security 24 breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other Internet or email events. Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly demanding, we may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information.Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for, and reporting, results. We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our Retail segment and our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting. In addition, we have e-commerce and other Internet websites in North America, Europe, and Japan and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in Asia and other parts of the world. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, or power outages. Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Implementation of management information systems may negatively impact our business.We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. For example, we are in the process of implementing a new global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. The implementation of this global system, scheduled to occur in phases over the next several years, began with the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems during Fiscal 2011 and continued with the transition of certain of our domestic operational and financial systems to the new global operating and financial reporting system during Fiscal 2012. During Fiscal 2013, we continued to develop and enhance those operational and financial systems previously transitioned to the new global operating and financial reporting system. The next phase of this implementation effort involves the migration of certain core areas of our business to the new system, including global merchandise procurement, and customer order management and record-to-report for our North American wholesale operations, beginning in Fiscal 2014. We have an orderly plan to transition a number of our existing legacy systems to the new system over the next few years.Implementation of a new management information system involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of a new system, such as the new global operating and financial reporting system currently being implemented, could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing and shipment of our product, and delays in the collection of cash from our customers, as well as have an adverse effect on our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our Ralph Lauren brands and to continue to develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers.Our success depends on the value of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate and respond to customers' demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to these consumer demands, preferences, and trends could adversely affect acceptance of our products. The Ralph Lauren name is integral to our business and our business could be adversely affected if Mr. Lauren's public image or reputation were to be tarnished. Merchandise missteps or unfavorable publicity could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and could result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.25 Our business could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our customers.We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer’s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables. During Fiscal 2013, sales to our largest wholesale customer, Macy's, Inc. ("Macy's"), accounted for approximately 12% of total net revenues. Further, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, including Macy's, comprised approximately 45% of all Wholesale revenues and approximately 20% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2013, and constituted approximately 30% of our gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 30, 2013. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1 — “Business — Wholesale Credit Control.”Uncertain economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. The current global political and economic environments have resulted in continued economic unpredictability in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In Europe, there are continuing concerns regarding the increased debt levels of certain countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as the overall stability of the Euro currency. Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity through the current global economic uncertainty, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers, and lenders and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. The inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. Deterioration in global financial markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor or a manufacturer’s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 700 foreign manufacturers in various countries. In Fiscal 2013, over 98% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Risks inherent in importing our products include:•changes in social, political, and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;•the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or exports;•the imposition of additional duties, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;•significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials;•increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel, and transportation;•disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters;•significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations;•the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti-dumping or countervailing duties; and•the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments.Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.26 In addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate, and increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. Furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries such as China continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. The cost of transportation has been increasing as well, and it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to rise and there is continued significant unrest in the Middle East. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability.Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.We generally purchase our products in U.S. Dollars. However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales are primarily derived from sales in foreign currencies, as is a portion of our licensing revenues, which could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. These foreign currencies primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar, the South Korean Won, the Canadian Dollar, the Swiss Franc, and the British Pound Sterling. Our international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. See Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Risk Management.”Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.We have significant undistributed earnings held by our subsidiaries outside the U.S. Most of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held outside of the U.S. and are considered to be permanently reinvested. We currently intend to reinvest these funds in order to fund strategic initiatives, working capital requirements, and debt repayments (both third-party and intercompany) of such foreign subsidiaries. Any future repatriation of such amounts to the U.S. could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate is made. 27 Our Company has an exclusive relationship with certain customers for some of our products. The loss or significant decline in business of these customers could negatively impact our business.We have exclusive relationships with certain customers for distribution of some of our products, including with Kohl’s for most of our Chaps products. Our arrangement with companies such as Kohl’s makes us dependent on those companies' financial and operational health for such products. The loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our Wholesale business.Our business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, and other ownership changes in the retail industry.Several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. During Fiscal 2013, sales to our largest wholesale customer, Macy's, accounted for approximately 12% of total net revenues. Further, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, including Macy's, comprised approximately 45% of all Wholesale revenues and approximately 20% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2013, and constituted approximately 30% of our gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 30, 2013. There can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, or other ownership changes in the department store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale business.We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their “private label” initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely impact our results of operations.We are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensees, or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings” for further discussion of our Company’s legal matters.In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently in the process of amending a number of existing accounting standards governing a variety of areas. Certain of these proposed standards, particularly the proposed standard governing accounting for leases, if and when effective, would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of proposed amendments to current accounting standards.Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, that could disrupt our operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar disruptions. The occurrence of natural events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. In addition, our business is affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. Such natural events, including unseasonable weather conditions, could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.28 Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. Significant counterfeiting of our products continues, however, and in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. See Item 1 — “Business — Trademarks,” and Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings.”Our business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. See Item 1 — “Business — Sourcing, Production and Quality.” We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.In addition, we rely on a number of owned and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. As such, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of our distribution centers. If any of our distribution centers were closed or were to become inoperable for any reason, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses.The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner’s business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner’s ability to:•obtain capital;•manage its labor relations;•maintain relationships with its suppliers;29 •manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively; and•maintain relationships with its customers.Although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant control over our licensing partners’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. See Item 1 — “Business — Our Licensing Segment.”Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.Although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. See Item 1 — “Business — Our Licensing Segment.”The voting shares of our Company’s stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.As of March 30, 2013, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately 83% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our Company. Mr. Lauren also serves as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and we employ other members of the Lauren family. From time to time, and as approved or authorized by our Board of Directors, we may have other business dealings with Mr. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or entities affiliated with Mr. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. Lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a class, and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If, and when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We CompeteThe downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessory, jewelry, watch, and home product industries, including, among others:•general business conditions;•economic downturns;•employment levels;•downturns in the stock market;•interest rates;30 •the housing market;•consumer debt levels;•the availability of consumer credit;•increases in fuel prices;•taxation; and•consumer confidence in future economic conditions.Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our licensing partners, sell our products may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Developments” for further discussion.The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.We face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial and marketing resources than us. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:•anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;•creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;•developing and maintaining innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers;•appropriately sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;•appropriately pricing products;•anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;•providing strong and effective marketing support;•retaining and recruiting key employees;•creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;•ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers;•obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail stores;•maintaining and growing market share; and•protecting our intellectual property.We also face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the Internet. Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition in the worldwide apparel, accessory, and home product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.31 The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer demands in a timely manner.The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, current economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost revenues. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1 — “Business — Sourcing, Production and Quality.”Item 1B
