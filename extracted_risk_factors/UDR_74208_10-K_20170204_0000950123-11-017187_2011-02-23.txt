    Item 1.  

    
    BUSINESS





 



    General


 


    UDR is a self administered real estate investment trust, or
    REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and
    manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the
    United States. At December 31, 2010, our consolidated
    apartment portfolio included 172 communities located in 23
    markets, with a total of 48,553 completed apartment homes, which
    are held through our operating partnerships, including the
    Operating Partnership and Heritage Communities L.P., our
    subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we
    have an ownership interest in 37 communities containing 9,891
    completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures.


 


    At December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership’s
    consolidated apartment portfolio included 81 communities located
    in 19 markets, with a total of 23,351 completed apartment homes.
    The Operating Partnership owns, acquires, renovates, develops,
    redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment
    communities generally located in high
    barrier-to-entry
    markets located in the United States. The high
    barrier-to-entry
    markets are characterized by limited land for new construction,
    difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive
    single-family home prices and significant employment growth
    potential. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010,
    revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately
    55% of our total rental revenues.


 


    UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such

    net income to our stockholders annually. In 2010, we declared
    total distributions of $0.730 per common share and paid
    dividends of $0.725 per common share.

    UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    The Operating Partnership was formed in 2004 as Delaware limited
    partnership. The Operating Partnership is the
    successor-in-interest
    to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed
    under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone
    number is
    (720) 283-6120.
    Our website is located at www.udr.com.


 


    As of February 17, 2011, we had 1,547 full-time
    associates and 85 part-time associates, all of whom were
    employed by UDR.


 



    Reporting
    Segments


 


    We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other
    Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those
    communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to
    January 1, 2009, and held as of December 31, 2010.
    These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
    communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or
    2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium
    conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties
    managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
    mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our
    operating segments, see Note 15 to UDR’s consolidated
    financial statements and Note 12 to the Operating
    Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.


 



    Business
    Objectives


 


    Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;




 



     
        • 

    
    manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment
    communities;




 



     
        • 

    
    empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;




 



     
        • 

    
    measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and




 



     
        • 

    
    manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of
    earnings and dividends.

    2010
    Highlights


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    We acquired five operating communities with 1,374 homes located
    in Orange County, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles,
    California; and Boston, Massachusetts for $412 million. We
    also acquired a land parcel located in San Francisco,
    California for $23.6 million.




 



     
        • 

    
    We acquired an interest in a joint venture with Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) for
    $100.8 million. The joint venture owns 26 operating
    communities with 5,748 homes and 11 parcels of land with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. The
    majority of the portfolio is comprised of mid/high-rise
    buildings located in urban, in-fill locations. The assets are
    located in many of our core markets with rent and quality levels
    at the top of each market.




 



     
        • 

    
    We completed the development of four wholly-owned communities
    with 1,575 homes at a total cost of $259.7 million.




 



     
        • 

    
    We completed the development of one community (274 apartment
    homes) held by a consolidated joint venture for a total cost of
    $122.3 million.




 



     
        • 

    
    We repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments.




 



     
        • 

    
    We repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by the Company matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.




 



     
        • 

    
    We closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points.




 



     
        • 

    
    In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and the unamortized discount was $519,000 at
    December 31, 2010.




 



     
        • 

    
    In 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of Common Stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of Common Stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million.




 



     
        • 

    
    We initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $20.35 per
    share. We granted the underwriters a
    30-day
    option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    Common Stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of Common Stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million.





 


    Other than the following, there were no significant changes to
    the Operating Partnership’s business during 2010 (the above
    2010 highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    On September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their








    
    4

    successors and assigns under the respective indenture
    (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
    stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture whether for
    principal of or interest on the securities (and premium, if
    any), and all other monetary obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities
    and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.





 



    Our
    Strategies and Vision


 


    We previously announced our vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment trust of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    growth:


 


    1. Strengthen our portfolio


 


    2. Continually improve operations


 


    3. Maintain access to low-cost capital


 



    Strengthen
    our Portfolio


 


    We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability,
    and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
    Portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party
    research, taking into account job growth, multifamily permitting
    and housing affordability.


 


    For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 55.7%
    of our same store net operating income was provided by our
    communities located in California, Metropolitan
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and Washington state.


 



    Operating
    Partnership Strategies and Vision


 


    The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to
    achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
    more concentrated markets. As a result, the Operating
    Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities
    located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C. and the
    Washington state markets over the past years. Prospectively, we
    plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets
    we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns.
    Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability
    and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.


 



    Acquisitions
    and Dispositions


 


    During 2010, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, we acquired five operating communities with 1,374
    apartment homes for approximately $412 million.


 


    When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;




 



     
        • 

    
    geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment,
    transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver
    significant economies of scale;




 



     
        • 

    
    construction quality, condition and design of the community;




 



     
        • 

    
    current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;




 



     
        • 

    
    potential for capital appreciation of the property;




 



     
        • 

    
    ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through operations and redevelopment;




 



     
        • 

    
    terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;




 



     
        • 

    
    occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;







    
    5



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and




 



     
        • 

    
    competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.





 


    We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding
    whether to dispose of a property include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;




 



     
        • 

    
    potential increases in new construction in the market area;




 



     
        • 

    
    areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially;




 



     
        • 

    
    markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term
    concentration; and




 



     
        • 

    
    operating efficiencies.





 


    During 2010, we sold one 149 apartment home community. This
    apartment home community was not owned by the Operating
    Partnership.

    acquisitions, apartment community dispositions and our

    Redevelopment
    Activities


 


    During 2010, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred
    $30.8 million in major renovations, which include major
    structural changes
    and/or
    architectural revisions to existing buildings.


 



    Joint
    Venture Activities


 


    In 2010, we completed the development of an apartment community
    located in Bellevue, Washington with 274 apartment homes,
    45,394 square feet of retail space and a carrying value of
    $122.3 million. On October 16, 2009, our partner in
    the joint venture (“Elements Too”) in this property
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. As a result of
    UDR’s control of the joint venture, we were required to
    consolidate the joint venture. On December 30, 2009, we
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Elements Too for $3.2 million, which was paid
    in 2010. At closing, our interest in Elements Too increased to
    98%.


 


    We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 31, 2009, our partner
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. Concurrently,
    we entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its
    49% interest in 989 Elements for $7.7 million, which was
    paid in 2010. At closing, our interest in 989 Elements increased
    to 98%.


 


    We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. We initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. On
    December 30, 2009, our partner relinquished its voting
    rights and approval rights and its ability to substantively
    participate in the decision-making process of the joint venture.
    Our partner also resigned as managing member and appointed us as
    managing member. Concurrently, we entered into an agreement with
    our partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue Plaza for
    $5.2 million, which was paid in 2010. At closing, our
    interest in Bellevue Plaza increased from 49% to 98%.


 


    For additional information regarding these consolidated joint
    ventures, see Note 5, Joint Ventures to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR, Inc. included in this
    Report.


 


    In November 2010, we acquired The Hanover Company’s
    (“Hanover”) partnership interests in the
    Hanover/MetLife Master Limited Partnership (the
    “UDR/MetLife Partnership”). The UDR/MetLife
    Partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities
    containing 5,748 homes and 11 land parcels with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. Under
    the terms of the UDR/MetLife Partnership, we will act as the
    general partner and earn fees for property and asset management
    and financing transactions. We acquired ownership interests of
    12.27% in the operating communities and 4.14% in the land
    parcels for $100.8 million. Our initial investment of
    $100.8 million consists of $71.8 million in cash,
    which includes associated transaction costs, and a
    $30 million payable (includes discount of $1 million)
    to Hanover. We agreed to pay the $30 million balance to
    Hanover in two interest free installments in the amounts of
    $20 million and $10 million on the first and second
    anniversaries of the closing, respectively. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 was $122.2 million.


 


    In October 2010, the Company entered into a venture with an
    affiliate of Hanover to develop a 240 apartment home
    community in the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area. At the
    closing and at





    
    7



Table of Contents





    December 31, 2010, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of
    95% in the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $10 million and our investment at December 31, 2010
    was $10.3 million.


 


    During 2009, we and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint
    venture for the investment of up to $450 million in
    multi-family properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180 million of which our maximum equity will be 30% or
    $54 million when fully invested. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the joint venture acquired its first
    property (151 homes) located in Metropolitan Washington D.C. for
    $43.1 million. At closing and at December 31, 2010, we
    owned 30% of the joint venture. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.2 million and
    $242,000, respectively.


 


    The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint
    venture activities described above.


 



    Continually
    Improve Operations


 


    We continue to make progress on automating our business as a way
    to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing
    needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our
    residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on
    our website. Our residents have access to conduct business with
    us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to pay rent on line
    and to submit service requests. In July 2010, we completed the
    roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio. As
    a result of transforming operations through technology our
    residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams
    have become more efficient. These improvements in adopting the
    web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a
    decline in marketing and advertising costs, improved cash
    management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing
    of our available apartment homes.


 


    In 2010, we launched an enhanced www.udr.com
    website along and a new Modern Living website that highlights
    our premier urban-style location communities. Both UDR.com and
    Modern Living feature innovative
    point-of-view
    walking tours (at select locations), social media content
    sharing and a new “save to favorites” feature that
    entices first-time visitors to revisit www.udr.com. In addition
    to improvements to www.udr.com, we also increased our suite of
    mobile and tablet device offerings with the addition of an iPad,
    Android, BlackBerry and Palm Pre apartment search applications.
    These overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our
    web visitor traffic to over 2.3 million visitors (up 24%)
    and almost 1.5 million organic search engine visitors (up
    30%) which contributed to a 20%
    year-over-year
    lead stream increase.


 



    Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital


 


    We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our
    debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both
    secured and unsecured debt.


 



    Special
    Dividend


 


    On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented our fourth
    quarter recurring distribution of $0.33 per share and an
    additional special distribution of $0.96 per share due to
    taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during
    the year. Subject to our right to pay the entire Special
    Dividend in cash, stockholders had the option to make an
    election to receive payment in cash or in shares, however, the
    aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders, other than
    cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, would not be less
    than $44.0 million.


 


    The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million, was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update
    2010-01,
    Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash (“ASU
    2010-01”),





    
    8



Table of Contents





    which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution as a stock dividend. Such a distribution is
    treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid. At
    December 31, 2008, we accrued $133.1 million of
    distribution payable related to the Special Dividend. ASU
    2010-01 is
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and should
    be applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, we reversed
    the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock
    pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was retroactively
    reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the
    Company’s
    Form 8-K
    filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the
    “SEC” on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend).


 



    Financing
    Activities


 


    As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and
    acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our
    major financing activities in 2010:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50.0 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments;




 



     
        • 

    
    repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by us matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations;




 



     
        • 

    
    closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points;




 



     
        • 

    
    in 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and had a discount of $519,000 at December 31,
    2010;




 



     
        • 

    
    in 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of common stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million;




 



     
        • 

    
    in 2010, we initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.35
    per share. We granted the underwriters a
    30-day
    option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million; and




 



     
        • 

    
    on September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors
    and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and
    punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
    acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture and the terms
    of the applicable securities

    and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.





 



    Markets
    and Competitive Conditions


 


    At December 31, 2010, 55.7% of our consolidated same store
    net operating income and 76% of the Operating Partnership’s
    same store net operating income was generated from apartment
    homes located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C.,
    Oregon, and Washington state. We believe that this
    diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases
    the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and
    economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability
    of our earnings.


 


    Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including
    sub-market
    supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or
    lower capital costs, than we do.


 


    We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;




 



     
        • 

    
    scalable operating and support systems, which include automated
    systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents
    and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;




 



     
        • 

    
    purchasing power;




 



     
        • 

    
    geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and




 



     
        • 

    
    significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.





 


    Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.


 



    Communities


 


    At December 31, 2010, our apartment portfolio included 172
    consolidated communities having a total of 48,553 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 930 apartment homes under
    development, which included the Operating Partnership’s
    apartment portfolio of 81 consolidated communities having a
    total of 23,351 completed apartment homes. The overall quality
    of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract
    residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more
    likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from
    the landlord to the resident. In addition, it potentially
    reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and
    therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future.


 



    Same
    Store Community Comparison


 


    We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    community population are operating communities which we own and
    have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the
    beginning of the prior year.




    
    10



Table of Contents





    For the year ended December 31, 2010, our same store NOI
    decreased by $6.2 million or 1.7% compared to the prior
    year. The decrease in NOI for the 40,699 apartment homes which
    make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in
    rental rates and an increase in expenses which was partially
    offset by increased occupancy.


 


    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Operating
    Partnership’s same store NOI decreased by $6.0 million
    or 2.7% compared to the prior year. The decrease in NOI for the
    22,104 apartment homes which make up the same store population
    was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates and increase in
    operating expenses which was partially offset by increased
    occupancy.


 


    Revenue growth in 2011 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.


 



    Tax
    Matters


 


    UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.


 


    We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.


 


    The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership
    for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating
    Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur
    federal income tax liability. However, any state or local
    revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the
    operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred
    at the entity level.


 



    Inflation


 


    We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.


 



    Environmental
    Matters


 


    Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action
    and/or
    claims for damages by a private party.


 


    To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to





    
    11



Table of Contents





    acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified
    environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior
    to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it
    is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal
    all environmental liabilities, or that some material
    environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some
    cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
    acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of
    hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been
    unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
    believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale
    abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
    professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos,
    lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a
    relatively conservative posture toward accepting known
    environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential
    liability associated with environmental hazards.


 


    Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.


 


    We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.


 



    Insurance


 


    We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary
    within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage
    in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis
    for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including
    loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.


 



    Executive
    Officers of the Company


 


    UDR is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.
    The following table sets forth information about our executive

    Item 1A.  

    
    RISK
    FACTORS





 


    There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects.


 



    Risks
    Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our
    Operations


 


    Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could
    Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value
    of Our Real Estate Assets.  Unfavorable market
    conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable
    economic conditions generally may significantly affect our
    occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of
    the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or





    
    14



Table of Contents





    dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable
    terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is
    adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily
    market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy,
    which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses
    and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the
    downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and
    uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses,
    including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do
    not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that
    declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues
    and/or the
    values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less
    cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our
    stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that
    may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues,
    and/or the
    value of our properties include the following, among others:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    downturns in the national, regional and local economic
    conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;




 



     
        • 

    
    declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable;




 



     
        • 

    
    government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing options more attractive;




 



     
        • 

    
    local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or
    reduced demand for, apartment homes;




 



     
        • 

    
    declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may
    make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in market rental rates;




 



     
        • 

    
    the timing and costs associated with property improvements,
    repairs or renovations;




 



     
        • 

    
    declines in household formation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.





 


    Continued Economic Weakness Following the Economic Recession
    that the U.S. Economy Recently Experienced May Materially
    and Adversely Affect our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.  The U.S. economy continues to
    experience weakness following a severe recession, which has
    resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending
    and a decline in residential and commercial property values.
    Although the U.S. economy has emerged from the recession,
    high levels of unemployment have persisted. If the economic
    recovery slows or stalls, we may experience adverse effects on
    our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our
    properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow,
    financial condition and results of operations.


 


    Substantial International, National and Local Government
    Spending and Increasing Deficits May Adversely Impact Our
    Business, Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.  The values of, and the cash flows
    from, the properties we own are affected by developments in
    global, national and local economies. As a result of the recent
    recession and the significant government interventions, federal,
    state and local governments have incurred record deficits and
    assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial
    institutions or other private entities. These increased budget
    deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state
    and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending,
    tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest
    rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events,
    which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.


 


    Risk of Inflation/Deflation.  Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. Neither
    inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations
    in the recent past. The general risk of inflation is that our
    debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase
    at a rate higher than our rental rates. The predominant effects
    of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction.
    Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain
    financing or refinancing for our properties. High unemployment
    may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our
    rental revenues.

    We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling
    Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and
    Financial Flexibility.  We periodically dispose of
    apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic
    objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult
    to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. We cannot
    predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the
    price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other
    terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to
    us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a
    willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
    Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct
    defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
    These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties
    and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our
    strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially
    adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value
    of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in
    connection with sales of our apartment communities:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property
    sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to
    qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
    “Code,” so that any related capital gain can be
    deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may
    not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated
    from our property sales; and




 



     
        • 

    
    federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this
    limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market
    conditions are favorable.





 


    Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes
    or Increase or Maintain Rents.  Our apartment
    communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in
    attracting residents, including other apartment communities,
    condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner
    occupied single-and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a
    particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease
    apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.


 


    We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future
    Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities
    and New Personnel Successfully Could Create
    Inefficiencies.  We have selectively acquired in
    the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we
    intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment
    communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition
    activities and their success are subject to the following risks:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on
    favorable terms or at all;




 



     
        • 

    
    even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from
    the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required
    principal and interest payments on the acquisition;




 



     
        • 

    
    even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment
    community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after
    incurring certain acquisition-related costs;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may incur significant costs and divert management attention
    in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential
    acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are
    subsequently unable to complete;




 



     
        • 

    
    an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures;




 



     
        • 

    
    when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional
    amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability,
    and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated
    improvements in profitability; and




 



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired
    apartment communities and new personnel into our existing
    operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such
    apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies
    that could adversely affect our expected return on our
    investments and our overall profitability.







    
    16



Table of Contents




 


    We do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we
    have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a
    material adverse effect on our business and the market value of
    our securities. In the past, other real estate investors,
    including insurance companies, pension and investment funds,
    developer partnerships, investment companies and other public
    and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire
    existing properties and to develop new properties, and such
    competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to
    pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms,
    which could adversely affect growth.


 


    Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.  In the past we have selectively
    pursued the development and construction of apartment
    communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate
    opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in
    the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated
    companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.
    Our development and construction activities are subject to the
    following risks:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to obtain construction financing for
    development activities under favorable terms, including but not
    limited to interest rates, maturity dates
    and/or loan
    to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even
    abandon potential developments;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs, could delay initial
    occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community,
    and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with
    respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits
    or authorizations;




 



     
        • 

    
    yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in
    completing projects, costs that exceed budget
    and/or
    higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents
    than pro forma;




 



     
        • 

    
    if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    we may be unable to complete construction and
    lease-up of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs;




 



     
        • 

    
    occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community; and




 



     
        • 

    
    when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.





 


    In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired
    communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.


 


    Bankruptcy of Developers in Our Development Joint Ventures
    Could Impose Delays and Costs on Us With Respect to the
    Development of Our Communities and May Adversely Affect Our
    Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.  The bankruptcy of one of the
    developers in any of our development joint ventures could
    materially and adversely affect the relevant property or
    properties. If the relevant joint venture through which we have
    invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the
    discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor
    a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our
    ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations
    than we would otherwise bear.


 


    Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.  We
    have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons





    
    17



Table of Contents





    or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of
    such structures. If we use such a structure, we could become
    engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture
    partners that might affect our ability to operate a
    jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint venture partners may
    have business, economic or other objectives that are
    inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that
    relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.


 


    Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by
    Insurance.  We have a comprehensive insurance
    program covering our property and operating activities. We
    believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these
    policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be
    adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we
    will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage.


 


    If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits
    occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have
    invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future
    revenue from the property. In such an event, we might
    nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other
    financial obligations related to the property. Material losses
    in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one
    or more of our significant properties were to experience a
    catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations,
    delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild
    the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow
    and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.


 


    Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.  We have acquired in the past, and we may
    acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise,
    apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets.
    Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks,
    and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets.
    These risks include, among others:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies;




 



     
        • 

    
    inability to hire and retain key personnel;




 



     
        • 

    
    lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures; and




 



     
        • 

    
    inability to achieve budgeted financial results.





 


    Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.  Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and
    clean-up
    costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.


 


    In addition, our properties are subject to various federal,
    state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including
    laws governing the management of wastes and underground and
    aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these
    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to
    liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of
    compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or
    increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise
    materially and adversely affect our operations.


 


    As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur
    liability based on various building conditions. For example,
    buildings and other structures on properties that we currently
    own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future
    contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing
    material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require
    that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines
    or penalties on owners, operators or employers for
    non-compliance with those requirements.





    
    18



Table of Contents





    These requirements include special precautions, such as removal,
    abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during
    maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially
    resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject
    to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as
    a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the
    environment.


 


    We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a
    result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to
    make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or
    liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.


 


    Our Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer
    from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to
    Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost
    for Remediation.  When excessive moisture
    accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth
    may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains
    undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some
    molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air
    quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation,
    chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other
    biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria.
    Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged
    to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms,
    including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence
    of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our
    properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation
    program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne
    contaminants or to increase ventilation. In addition, the
    presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants
    could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if
    property damage or personal injury occurs.


 


    Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and
    Requirements Could Result in Substantial
    Costs.  The Americans with Disabilities Act
    generally requires that public buildings, including our
    properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.
    Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the
    federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.
    From time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect
    to some of our properties under this Act. If, under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make
    substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more
    of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it
    could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.


 


    Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local
    regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
    safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these
    requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We
    do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether
    compliance with future requirements will require significant
    unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and
    results of operations.


 


    Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.  Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
    (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
    regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
    affect funds from operations and the ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.


 


    Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather
    Events.  Certain of our communities are located in
    the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and
    fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks
    of other inclement weather. The adverse weather events could
    cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels.
    In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could
    lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as
    anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also
    continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or
    other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could
    materially and adversely affect our business and our financial
    condition and results of operations.

    Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse
    Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease
    the Value of Our Assets.  Actual or threatened
    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
    Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment
    communities could significantly affect our ability to operate
    those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our
    expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover
    all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the
    adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future
    attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have
    a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.


 


    We May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets
    and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could
    Materially and Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition,
    Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of Our
    Common Stock.  A decline in the fair value of our
    assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such
    assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to
    any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the
    ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized
    cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we
    would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write
    down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis,
    based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are
    considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect
    non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent
    disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our
    future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference
    between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of
    such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize
    asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could
    materially and adversely affect our financial condition,
    liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price
    of our common stock.


 


    Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.


 


    Our Success Depends on Our Senior
    Management.  Our success depends upon the
    retention of our senior management, whose continued service in
    not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified
    replacements for the individuals who make up our senior
    management if their services should no longer be available to
    us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior
    management team could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.


 


    We May be Adversely Affected by New Laws and
    Regulations.  The current United States
    administration and Congress have enacted, or called for
    consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues,
    including with respect to health care, financial regulation
    reform, climate control, executive compensation and others. We
    believe that these and other potential proposals could have
    varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to
    material. At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty
    what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.


 


    Certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an
    impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as
    contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing
    economic downturn. These initiatives have created a degree of
    uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate
    industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the
    United States at least since the wave of lawmaking and
    regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the Great
    Depression. The federal legislative response in this area has
    culminated most recently in the enactment on July 21, 2010
    of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Many of the provisions of the
    Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed
    effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by
    regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known
    for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act, including
    future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation
    of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory
    proposals that are proposed or pending in the United States
    Congress, may





    
    20



Table of Contents





    limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us,
    and/or
    intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways
    that are not currently identifiable.


 


    Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate
    governance and public disclosure in particular, including
    certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and
    regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for
    public companies like ours and could significantly increase the
    costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public
    markets. Because we are committed to maintaining high standards
    of internal control over financial reporting, corporate
    governance and public disclosure, our management team will need
    to devote significant time and financial resources to comply
    with these evolving standards for public companies. We intend to
    continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both
    existing and evolving standards, and this investment has
    resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general
    and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time
    and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance
    activities.


 


    Changes in the System for Establishing U.S. Accounting
    Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported
    Results of Operations.  Accounting for public
    companies in the United States has historically been conducted
    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as
    in effect in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP is
    established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
    “FASB”), an independent body whose standards are
    recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held
    companies. The International Accounting Standards Board (the
    “IASB”) is a London-based independent board
    established in 2001 and charged with the development of
    International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
    IFRS generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in
    Europe and in developed nations around the world.


 


    IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP. Among other things,
    IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value”
    models of accounting for assets and liabilities than GAAP.
    “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation
    of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in
    such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on
    historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.


 


    The SEC has proposed the mandatory adoption of IFRS by United
    States public companies starting in 2015, with early adoption
    permitted before that date. It is unclear at this time how the
    SEC will propose that GAAP and IFRS be harmonized if the
    proposed change is adopted. In addition, switching to a new
    method of accounting and adopting IFRS will be a complex
    undertaking. We may need to develop new systems and controls
    based on the principles of IFRS. Since these are new endeavors,
    and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately
    adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated
    with this conversion are uncertain.


 


    We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of IFRS
    on our financial position and results of operations. Such
    evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity
    regarding the specific IFRS standards that will be adopted.
    Until there is more certainty with respect to the IFRS standards
    to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our
    conversion to IFRS could have a material adverse impact on our
    reported results of operations.


 



    Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings


 


    Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.  We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy UDR’ Inc.’s distribution
    requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income
    tax purposes. In addition, the full limits of our line of credit
    may not be available to us if our operating performance falls
    outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also
    likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding
    debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing
    debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as
    the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to
    sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would
    otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to
    comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to





    
    21



Table of Contents





    repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have
    an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs
    and impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.


 


    Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.  If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDR,
    Inc.’s stockholders will be adversely affected. The
    following factors, among others, may affect the net rental
    income generated by our apartment communities:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the national and local economies;




 



     
        • 

    
    local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes;




 



     
        • 

    
    tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located;




 



     
        • 

    
    our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance;




 



     
        • 

    
    rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    competition from other apartment communities;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of
    compliance; and




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent
    control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.





 


    Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment
    community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance
    and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when
    circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
    community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt
    and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could
    sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or
    the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.


 


    Debt Level May Be Increased.  Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.


 


    Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.  Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real
    estate industry have experienced limited availability of
    financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity
    securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of
    incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could
    be diluted.


 


    Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact
    Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects
    on Us and the Market Price of Our Stock.  Our
    ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt
    obligations will depend on our operating and financial
    performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic
    conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond
    our control. During the past few years, the United States stock
    and credit markets have experienced significant price
    volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have
    caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially
    and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen
    considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted
    liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain
    financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in
    the unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty in the
    stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to
    access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our
    properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may
    negatively affect our business. Additionally, due to this
    uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing
    indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not





    
    22



Table of Contents





    be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. If we
    are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due,
    we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous
    terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other
    debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in
    the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources
    of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to
    adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make
    it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the
    issuance of our common or preferred stock. The disruptions in
    the financial markets have had and may continue to have a
    material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares
    and other adverse effects on us and our business.


 


    Prospective buyers of our properties may also experience
    difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more
    difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing
    levels. Tightening of credit in financial markets and high
    unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of
    tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue
    increasing rents on a prospective basis. Disruptions in the
    credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects
    on us and the overall economy.


 


    A Change in U.S. Government Policy Regarding Fannie Mae
    or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our
    Business.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major
    source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate.
    We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae
    and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing
    apartment loans. In September 2008, the U.S. government
    assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placed both
    companies into a government conservatorship under the Federal
    Housing Finance Agency. The Administration has recently proposed
    potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the
    U.S. that could involve the phase out of Fannie Mae and
    Freddie Mac. While we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will
    continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they
    discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or
    be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would
    significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely
    affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness
    at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to
    sale assets. Uncertainty in the future activity and involvement
    of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a source of financing could
    negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it
    more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may
    adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do
    sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of
    debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.


 


    The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us.  We have relationships with many
    financial institutions, including lenders under our credit
    facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result,
    defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial
    institutions or the financial services industry generally, could
    result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event
    that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects
    these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other
    parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete
    transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our
    business and results of operations.


 


    Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.  We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, UDR,
    Inc. had approximately $1 billion of variable rate
    indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 29% of
    total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had
    approximately $304 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 28% of total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase
    the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing
    new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely
    affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
    distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged
    interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to
    make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an
    increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders
    to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect
    the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt
    securities.


 


    Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.  From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest





    
    23



Table of Contents





    rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities
    by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this
    to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also,
    from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts
    to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable
    changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt
    securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest
    rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest
    rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore,
    the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved
    and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our
    use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to
    additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
    hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations.
    Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex
    and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated
    with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that
    our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on
    our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of
    these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as
    transaction fees or breakage costs.


 



    Risks
    Related to Tax Laws


 


    We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if UDR Failed to
    Qualify as a REIT.  UDR has elected to be taxed as
    a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us
    to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and
    quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex
    Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
    administrative interpretations, and involves the determination
    of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
    our control. We intend that our current organization and method
    of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we
    may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified
    in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws
    governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative
    interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time,
    potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new
    regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
    could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or
    adversely affect our stockholders.


 


    If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
    subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
    corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends
    paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also,
    unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
    certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status
    until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first
    failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from
    the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the
    amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our
    stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse
    effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise
    additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required
    to make distributions to our stockholders. Even if we continue
    to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain
    federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.


 


    REITs May Pay a Portion of Dividends in Common
    Stock.  In December 2009, the Internal Revenue
    Service issued Revenue Procedure
    2010-12,
    which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to
    certain stock distributions made by publicly traded REITs to
    satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. This
    expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit REITs to limit
    cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the
    current downturn in economic conditions. Under this expanded
    guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after
    January 1, 2008 and before December 31, 2012, with
    respect to a taxable year ending on or before December 31,
    2011, the Internal Revenue Service will treat a distribution of
    stock by a publicly traded REIT, pursuant to certain stockholder
    elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable
    distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions,
    (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is
    not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and
    (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each
    stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata
    amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under
    the declaration, but in no event will any such electing
    stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder’s
    entire entitlement in money. The amount of such stock
    distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of
    cash that could have been received instead. If we pay a portion
    of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this
    temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than
    they received in distributions in prior years and the market
    value of our securities may decline.

    UDR May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable
    REIT Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.  We have established several taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Despite UDR’s qualification as a REIT, its
    taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable
    income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to
    continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and
    investments for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure
    that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not
    adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide
    assurance that we will successfully achieve that result.
    Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may
    jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property
    sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied
    deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or
    are otherwise not respected.


 


    REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available
    Cash.  As a REIT, UDR is subject to annual
    distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we
    retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund
    our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90%
    of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain,
    in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to
    corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our
    stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code.
    However, differences in timing between the recognition of
    taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us
    to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term
    basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.


 


    Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.  From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
    properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to
    customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as
    income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100%
    penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment
    purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or
    disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However,
    whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
    of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
    surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
    Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of
    properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal
    Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or
    disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
    then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain
    allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may
    jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property
    sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might
    adversely affect UDR’s ability to satisfy the income tests
    for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.


 


    We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse
    Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.  As discussed
    in the risk factors above, because UDR is organized and
    qualifies as a REIT it is generally not subject to federal
    income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local
    taxes. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or
    regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our
    tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and
    municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to
    an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such
    changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and
    local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect
    our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the
    payment of distributions to our stockholders. In the normal
    course of business, entities through which we own real estate
    may also become subject to tax audits. If such entities become
    subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of
    such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial
    condition.


 


    The Operating Partnership Intends to Qualify as a
    Partnership, But Cannot Guarantee That It Will
    Qualify.  The Operating Partnership intends to
    qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any
    such time that the Operating Partnership admits additional
    limited partners other than UDR, Inc. If classified as a
    partnership, the Operating Partnership generally will not be a
    taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability.
    However, the Operating Partnership would be treated as a
    corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a
    “publicly traded partnership,” unless at least 90% of
    the Operating Partnership’s income was qualifying income as
    defined in the Code. A “publicly traded partnership”
    is a partnership whose





    
    25



Table of Contents





    partnership interests are traded on an established securities
    market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the
    substantial equivalent thereof). Although the Operating
    Partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an
    established securities market, because of the redemption right,
    the Operating Partnership’s units held by limited partners
    could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or
    the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating
    Partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe
    harbors” under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying
    income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such
    as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income
    requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of
    qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in
    most respects. The Operating Partnership may not meet this
    qualifying income test. If the Operating Partnership were to be
    taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax
    liabilities, and UDR, Inc. would then fail to qualify as a REIT
    for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain
    statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise
    additional capital would be impaired.


 



    Risks
    Related to Our Organization and Ownership of UDR, Inc.’s
    Stock


 


    Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.  The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list UDR, Inc’s common stock,
    have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition
    to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a
    number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of
    our common stock, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    general market and economic conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating
    results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of
    our stock;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt;




 



     
        • 

    
    decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in market valuations of similar companies;




 



     
        • 

    
    publication of research reports about us or the real estate
    industry;




 



     
        • 

    
    the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate companies);




 



     
        • 

    
    general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends;




 



     
        • 

    
    a change in analyst ratings;




 



     
        • 

    
    additions or departures of key management personnel;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the
    future;




 



     
        • 

    
    speculation in the press or investment community;




 



     
        • 

    
    terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in
    which our securities trade, possibly increasing market
    volatility and causing the further erosion of business and
    consumer confidence and spending;




 



     
        • 

    
    failure to qualify as a REIT;




 



     
        • 

    
    strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as
    acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic
    investments or changes in business strategy;







    
    26

        • 

    
    failure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE;




 



     
        • 

    
    governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the
    perception that such sales might occur, including under our
    at-the-market
    equity distribution program.





 


    Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These
    factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock
    to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or our prospects.


 


    We May Change the Dividend Policy for Our Common Stock in the
    Future.  The decision to declare and pay dividends
    on UDR’s common stock, as well as the timing, amount and
    composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole
    discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our
    earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition,
    capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other
    limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution
    requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law
    and such other factors as our board of directors considers
    relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a
    material adverse effect on the market price of UDR’s common
    stock.


 


    Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.  Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and
    662/3%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.


 


    Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    Restricts the Transferability of Our Stock and May Prevent
    Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
    Stockholders.  One of the requirements for
    maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
    outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
    individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during
    the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains
    ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock
    primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT
    ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the
    effect of preventing a change of control, which does not
    threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent
    such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of
    our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership
    limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of
    the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be
    considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such
    stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of
    our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
    change of control might involve a premium price for our
    stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
    best interests.
