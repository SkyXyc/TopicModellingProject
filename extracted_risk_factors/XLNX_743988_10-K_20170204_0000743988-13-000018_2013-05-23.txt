(Xilinx, the Company or we) designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies, including: •integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), including programmable System on Chips (SoCs) and three dimensional ICs, or 3D ICs;•software design tools to program the PLDs;•targeted reference designs;•printed circuit boards; and•intellectual property (IP), which consists of Xilinx and various third-party verification and IP cores.In addition to its programmable platforms, Xilinx provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our customers program to perform desired logic functions, and programmable SoCs, which combine industry standard ARM® processor-based systems with programmable logic in a single device. We also design and develop 3D ICs, which stack FPGA logic die or a combination of FPGA and 28 Gigabits/second (28G) transceiver die in a single package to exceed the capacity and bandwidth of monolithic devices, but with manufacturing and time-to-volume advantages of smaller die.  Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing.  We sell our products and services through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronic manufacturing service providers (EMS). Sales are generated either by these independent distributors, independent sales representative or our direct sales organization. Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984.  In April 1990, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com.Industry Overview There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system.  Xilinx designs and develops PLDs, a type of logic device.  Alternatives to PLDs may include application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs).  PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs may be utilized in many of the same types of electronic systems.  However, differences in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, capacity, features and functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine which devices are best-suited for specific applications.  3Table of ContentsPLDs have key competitive advantages over ASICs and ASSPs, including:•Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility.  Both of these advantages are enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs quickly.  In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.   •PLDs are standard components.  This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications.  In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application. PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to chips that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than PLDs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost.  However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers.  This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes.  From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production; and PLDs have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production.  However, we expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes. An overview of typical PLD end market applications for our products is shown in the following table:End Markets Sub-Segments Applications     Communications & Data Center Wireless •   3G/4G Base Stations    •   Wireless Backhaul       Wireline •   Enterprise Routers and Switches    •   Metro Optical Networks    •   Data Centers     Industrial, Aerospace & Defense Industrial, Scientific and Medical •   Factory Automation    •   Medical Imaging    •   Test and Measurement Equipment       Aerospace and Defense •   Satellite Surveillance    •   Radar and Sonar Systems    •   Secure Communications     Broadcast, Consumer &  Consumer •   Digital Televisions     Automotive   •   Digital SLR Cameras    •   Set-Top Boxes       Automotive •   Infotainment Systems    •   Driver Information Systems    •   Driver Assistance Systems       Audio, Video and Broadcast •   Cable Head-End Systems    •   Post Production Equipment    •   Broadcast Cameras     Other Storage and Servers •   Security and Encryption    •   Computer Peripherals       Office Automation •   Copiers    •   Printers4Table of ContentsStrategy and CompetitionOur strategy for expansion is the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next generation electronic systems. The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements - cost, power, performance and density - in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP non-recurring engineering costs and increased economic and development risk.With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products.Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion.  We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi) and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, as well as competition from the ASSP market.  Other competitors include manufacturers of: •high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;•high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;•ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; •high-speed, low-density CPLDs;•high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;•products with embedded processors;•products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and •other new or emerging programmable logic products.We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:•product pricing;•time-to-market;•product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;•field upgradability;•adaptability of products to specific applications;•ease of use and functionality of software design tools;•availability and functionality of predefined IP; •inventory and supply chain management;•access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and•ability to provide timely customer service and support.Silicon Product OverviewA brief overview of the silicon product offerings is listed in the table below.

Prior generation Spartan families include Spartan-IIE, Spartan-II, Spartan XL and the original Spartan family.  CPLDs operate on the lowest end of the programmable logic density spectrum.  CPLDs are single-chip, nonvolatile solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect. CPLDs combine the advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of high performance and low cost.  Prior generations of CPLDs include the CoolRunnerTM and XC9500 product families.EasyPath™ FPGAs    EasyPath FPGAs offer customers a fast, simple method of cost-reducing FPGA designs.  EasyPath FPGAs use the same production masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a specific customer application to improve yield and lower costs.  As a result, EasyPath FPGAs provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the standard FPGA devices without the conversion risk, engineering effort, or the additional time required to move to an ASIC.  The latest generation of EasyPath FPGAs and EasyPath-7 FPGAs provide lower total product cost of ownership for cost-reducing high performance FPGAs.Design Platforms and ServicesProgrammable PlatformsWe offer three types of programmable platforms that support our customers’ designs and reduce their development efforts:  The Base Platform is the delivery vehicle for all of our new silicon offerings used to develop and run customer-specific software applications and hardware designs.  Released at launch, the Base Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; Vivado® Design Suite design environment; integration support of optional third-party synthesis, simulation, and signal integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP.The Domain-Specific Platform targets one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the embedded processing developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer.  It accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of integrated technologies, including: higher-level design methodologies and tools; domain-specific IP including embedded,  mixed signal, video, DSP and connectivity; domain-specific development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems and software.The Market-Specific Platform enables software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their specific application or solution.   Built for specific markets such as automotive, consumer, aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast, industrial, or scientific and medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with higher targeted applications elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a particular market.7Table of ContentsDesign ToolsTo accommodate the various design methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our customers’ user profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and logic designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each user profile for design creation, design implementation and design verification. During April 2012, Xilinx introduced the next-generation Vivado™ Design Suite designed to improve developer productivity resulting in faster design integration and implementation. The Vivado suite hallmarks include an easy-to-use IP-centric design flow and significant improvement in run times.  The standards-based Vivado tools include high-level synthesis to provide a more direct flow in retargeting DSPs and general purpose processor designs into our FPGAs, IP Integrator to rapidly stitch together cores at higher levels of abstraction, and a new analytical place-and-route engine which significantly improves run times.  The Vivado suite supports both Xilinx 7 series FPGAs and Zynq-7000, our programmable SoCs.The previous generation tool suite, the Integrated Software Environment (ISE®) Design Suite, supports Xilinx 7 series FPGAs, programmable SoCs and all previous generation FPGAs, enabling customers to transition to the Vivado Design Suite when the timing is right for their design needs.  Both the Vivado Design Suite and ISE Design Suite operate with a wide range of third-party Electronic Design Automation software point-tools offerings.Intellectual Property Xilinx and various third parties offer hundreds of no charge and fee-bearing IP core licenses covering Ethernet, memory controllers, Interlaken and PCIe® interface, as well as an abundance of domain-specific IP in the areas of embedded, DSP and connectivity, and market-specific IP cores. In addition, our products and technology leverage industry standards such as ARM AMBA® AXI-4 interconnect technology, IP-XACT and IEEE P1735 encryption to facilitate plug-and-play FPGA design and take advantage of the large ecosystem of ARM IP developers.Development Boards, Kits and Configuration ProductsIn addition to the broad selection of legacy development boards presently offered, we have introduced a new unified board strategy that enables the creation of a standardized and coordinated set of base boards available both from Xilinx and our ecosystem vendors, all utilizing the industry-standard extensions that enable customization for market specific applications.  Adopting this standard for all of our base boards enables the creation of a scalable and extensible delivery mechanism for all Xilinx programmable platforms.We also offer comprehensive development kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference designs that are designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and market-specific applications.Finally, Xilinx offers a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and in-system programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs.  These PROM (programmable read-only memory) products support all of our FPGA devices. Third-Party Alliances Xilinx and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP, boards, tools, services and support through the Xilinx alliance program.  Xilinx also works with these third parties to promote our programmable platforms through third-party tools, IP, software, boards and design services.Engineering ServicesXilinx engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design teams and to provide expert design-specific advice.  Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the needs of its customers, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.Research and DevelopmentOur research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed toward the design of new ICs, the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the design of logic IP, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering PLD power consumption.  As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Artix-7 and Zynq-7000 families.  We have made enhancements to our IP core offerings 8Table of Contentsand introduced Vivado tools, our next generation software design suite.  We extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 65-nm, 45-nm, 40-nm and 28-nm manufacturing technology, enabling us to be the first company in the PLD industry to ship 45-nm high-volume as well as 28-nm FPGA devices. Additionally, our investment in R&D has allowed us to ship the industry’s first 28-nm PLD with embedded ARM technology as well as the industry’s first 3D IC devices.Our R&D challenge is to continue to develop new products that create value-added solutions for customers.  In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, our R&D expenses were $475.5 million, $435.3 million and $392.5 million, respectively.  We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and are committed to maintaining a significant level of R&D investment.  Sales and DistributionWe sell our products to OEMs, EMSs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs and EMSs.  We use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales.  In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts.  Distributors and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories.  Distributors also provide inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers. Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders.  In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability. In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale.  Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors’ end customers. Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide.  As of March 30, 2013 and March 31, 2012, Avnet accounted for 64% and 67%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.  Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 46%, 48% and 51% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  We also use other regional distributors throughout the world.  We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services.  Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk and "Note 16. Segment Information" for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations.No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011.  Backlog As of March 30, 2013, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $253.0 million, compared to $261.0 million as of March 31, 2012.  Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty.  As a result, backlogs from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.Wafer FabricationAs a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs.  Rather, we purchase our wafers from independent foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung).  Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial majority of our wafers and TSMC manufactures the wafers for our newest products.  Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry.  9Table of ContentsOur strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication.  We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs.  Sort, Assembly and TestWafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors.  Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors.  During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types.  Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by Xilinx personnel at our Singapore facility or by independent test subcontractors.  We purchase most of our assembly and some of our test services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan and Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines.Quality CertificationXilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management systems certification to TL9000/ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Hyderabad, India.  In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations.Patents and LicensesWhile our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.  As of March 30, 2013, we held over 3,000 issued United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in duration, and over 400 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our proprietary technology.  We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, IP cores, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to our products and business.  We have licensed some parties to certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party patents as well. We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors.  Those licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers.  We also have acquired various licenses to certain third-party proprietary software, open-source software and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools.  Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend.  We maintain the Xilinx trade name and trademarks, including the following trademarks that are registered in the U.S. and other countries:  Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Artix, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Virtex, Vivado and Zynq-7000.  Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business.  We have also obtained the rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business. We intend to continue to protect our IP rights (including, for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) vigorously.  We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.  However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.Corporate ResponsibilityXilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility. Through senior-level sponsorship, regular environmental, health and safety assessments and company-wide performance targets, we strive to achieve a culture that emphasizes contribution to local and global communities through a number of key initiatives:Company  We strive to meet or exceed industry and regulatory standards for ethical business practices, product responsibility, and supplier management.  All Xilinx’s directors, officers and employees are required to comply not only with the letter of the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of our business, but also with the spirit of those laws.  10Table of Contents                        Environment  We monitor regulatory and resource trends and are committed to setting focused targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste of our operations and minimizing our overall environmental impact with regards to the communities around us and consistent with global climate change efforts.Community We are committed to growing strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that are designed to  develop and strengthen communities located around the world. Xilinx develops local community relationships at key sites through funding and involvement that encourages active participation, teamwork, and volunteerism. Xilinx supports opportunities initiated by its employees and that involve participation and empowerment of its employees. We are committed to charitable giving programs that work toward systemic change and measurable results.Workplace  We provide a safe and healthy work environment where employee diversity is embraced and opportunities for training, growth, and advancement are strongly encouraged.  The Xilinx Code of Social Responsibility outlines standards to ensure that working conditions at Xilinx are safe and that workers are treated with respect, fairness and dignity.EmployeesAs of March 30, 2013, we had 3,329 employees compared to 3,265 as of the end of the prior fiscal year.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.Executive Officers of the RegistrantCertain information regarding the executive officers of Xilinx as of May 23, 2013 is set forth below:Name Age PositionMoshe N.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial, also may impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including: •timely completion of new product designs; •ability to generate new design opportunities and design wins; •availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; •ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 28-nm and smaller; •achieving acceptable yields; •ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors; •ability to obtain advanced packaging; •availability of supporting software design tools; •utilization of predefined IP logic; •customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and •market acceptance of our customers’ products. Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products, and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 13Table of ContentsWe rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations. Most of our wafers are manufactured in Taiwan by UMC. In addition, we also have wafers manufactured in South Korea by Samsung and the wafers for our newest products are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC, TSMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC who manufactures our newest products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.  Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will offer us competitive pricing terms or other commercial terms important to our business.  We cannot guarantee that our foundries will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or that they will continue to manufacture a product for the full life of the product. In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we experienced supply shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries when they had to rapidly increase their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and first nine months of fiscal 2011, we also experienced supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which led to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.We have established other sources of wafer supply for many of our products in an effort to secure a continued supply of wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships require the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we do not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our results of operations.General economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During the past three years, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia. Recent events have shown that the financial condition of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, is of continuing concern as the sovereign debt crisis remains unresolved.  Recent events have also elevated concerns that macroeconomic conditions will worsen and economic recovery will be delayed.  These weak economic conditions resulted in reduced customer demand and had a negative impact on our results of operations for the second and third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the third quarter of fiscal 2013. If weak economic conditions persist or worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could continue, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, potentially causing production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the industry. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results.The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers’ products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers’ designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are dependent upon "turns," orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to 14Table of Contentsforecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.If we are not able to successfully compete in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected.Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera, Lattice and Microsemi, and from new market entrants. In addition, competition from the ASIC market and from the ASSP market continues. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include: •product pricing; •time-to-market; •product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; •field upgradeability; •adaptability of products to specific applications; •ease of use and functionality of software design tools; •availability and functionality of predefined IP logic; •inventory and supply chain management; •access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and •ability to provide timely customer service and support. Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance, high-density applications. However, we may not be successful in executing this strategy.  In addition, we anticipate continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace our ability to lower the cost for established products. Other competitors include manufacturers of:•high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA type architectures; •high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; •ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; •high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices; •high-performance digital signal processing devices; •products with embedded processors; •products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and •other new or emerging programmable logic products. Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment. We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain aspects of our older technology, and we may do so in the future. Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be competitive with some of our older products.Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues. If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers ceases or suspends operations, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases, wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities, resulting in potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, certain suppliers were forced to temporarily halt production, resulting in a tightening of supply for those materials.  Such shortages of wafers and materials as well as increases in wafer or materials 15Table of Contentsprices could adversely affect our gross margins and would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue. We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 46% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2013 and as of March 30, 2013, Avnet accounted for 64% of our total net accounts receivable. Any adverse change to our relationship with Avnet or our remaining distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business and financial results would suffer. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could result in the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors.We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services, and unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes and ramping up volume for new products, transitions to new service providers or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.A number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.A number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies can cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.Our current inventory levels are higher than historical norms due to our decision to build ahead of a previously planned closure of a particular foundry process line at one of our foundry partners, weaker than anticipated sales and a planned increase in safety stock across newer technologies in anticipation of future revenue growth.  In the event demand does not materialize, we may be subject to incremental obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could have an increased impact on our inventory valuation, which would then impact our operating results. Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins. The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.Because of our international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse affect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and an R&D site in India. Our international operations have grown because we have relocated certain operations and administrative functions outside the U.S.  Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive over one-half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan. Past economic weaknesses in these markets adversely affected revenues. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movements of the Euro and Yen exchange rates against the U.S. dollar had no material impact 16Table of Contentsto our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers’ ability to repay existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, any devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, by political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. or other military actions could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business.In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including tax laws and regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, anti-corruption laws, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. Adverse change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability.Therefore, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions. Our failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete effectively.We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet future consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development 17Table of Contentstools that are available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption. We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or upgrade or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. For example, in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we upgraded the IT systems we use to manage our operations and record and report financial information, and in the past we simplified our supply chain and were required to make certain changes to our IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption.  We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or attack.  In the past there have been attempts by third parties to penetrate and or infect our network and systems with malicious software, in an effort to gain access to our network and systems. We seek to detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.  Our business could be significantly harmed and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of such a security breach. Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.The independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. UMC’s and TSMC's foundries in Taiwan and Seiko’s foundries in Japan and our assembly and test partners in Japan and other regions as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations.  This type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.  For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, production at the Seiko foundry at Sakata was halted temporarily, impacting production of some of our older devices.  In addition, suppliers of wafers and substrates were forced to halt production temporarily.  Disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, natural disasters can also indirectly impact us.  For example, our customers’ supply of other complimentary products may be disrupted by a natural disaster and may cause them to delay orders of our products. Certain types of these natural disasters might be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, which would increase the overall adverse effect of all the above. In addition, the access to water sources for our supply chain could also be adversely affected with climate change, which would potentially negatively affect our manufacturing strategy.If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us.  We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel.  Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers.  Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel.  From time to time we have effected restructurings which eliminate a number of positions.  Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future.  If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under Item 3. "Legal Proceedings," included in Part I of this Form 10-K, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. 18Table of ContentsRegardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us.We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems could result in claims against us, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses.In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous. In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories, long-lived assets including acquisition-related intangibles, goodwill, taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, input from outside experts and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially affected.The conditional conversion features of the outstanding debentures, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.Our outstanding debentures have conditional conversion features.  In the event the conditional conversion features of the debentures are triggered, holders of such debentures will be entitled to convert the debentures at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their debentures, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders do not elect to convert their debentures, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the debentures as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  In addition, we could be required to increase the number of shares used in our per share calculations to reflect the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion.Our failure to comply with the requirements of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Certain Xilinx space-grade FPGAs and related technologies are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. The ITAR governs the export and reexport of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technical data and the provision of defense services, as well as offshore production, test and assembly. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet ITAR requirements.An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent ITAR licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.19Table of ContentsOur inability to effectively control the sale of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors which helps to ensure that products delivered to our customers are authentic and properly handled.  From time to time, customers may purchase products bearing our name from the unauthorized "gray market."   These parts may be counterfeit, salvaged or re-marked parts, or parts that have been altered, mishandled, or damaged.  Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast supply or demand.  Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our authorized distributors may compete with brokers of these discounted products, which can adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our margins.  In addition, our reputation with customers may be negatively impacted when gray market products bearing our name fail or are found to be substandard.The conflict minerals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities.  In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.  These new requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor products.   There will also be costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  We may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the due diligence process we implement.  Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free. Considerable amounts of our common shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans and convertible debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the market price of our common shares. As of March 30, 2013 we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 263.6 million shares were outstanding. In addition, 43.6 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 43.4 million common shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures and 20.0 million common shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of warrants. The availability of substantial amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of convertible debentures using common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. We have indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.The aggregate amount of our consolidated indebtedness as of March 30, 2013 was $1.29 billion (principal amount). We also may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness may:•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the debentures and our other indebtedness;•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors;•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions; and•require us to repatriate off-shore cash to the U.S. at unfavorable tax rates.Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.20Table of ContentsThe call options and warrant transactions related to our 2.625% Senior Convertible Debentures due June 15, 2017 (2.625% Debentures) may affect the value of the debentures and our common stock.To hedge against potential dilution upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures, we purchased call options on our common stock from the hedge counterparties. We also sold warrants to the hedge counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants of $42.46 per share. As the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify hedge positions, they may enter or unwind various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions. This activity also could affect the market price of our common stock and/or debentures, which could affect the ability of the holders of the debentures to convert and the number of shares and value of the consideration that will be received by the holders of the debentures upon conversion.Acquisitions and strategic investments present risks, and we may not realize the goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.We recently acquired technology companies whose products complement our products, and in the past we have made a number of strategic investments in other technology companies.  We may make similar acquisitions and strategic investments in the future.  Acquisitions and strategic investments present risks, including:•our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by investment, acquisition, transition or integration activities;•an acquisition or strategic investment may not further our business strategy as we expected, and we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected;•our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition;•we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines;•we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, and in general and administrative functions that support such products; •our strategic investments may not perform as expected; and•we may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions and strategic investments pursuant to U.S. GAAP.The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions or strategic investments.ITEM 1B
