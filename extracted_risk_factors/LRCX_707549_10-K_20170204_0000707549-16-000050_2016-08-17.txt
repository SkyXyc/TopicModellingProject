. Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“2016 Form 10-K”), the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.The Semiconductor Capital Equipment Industry is Subject to Variability and, as a Result, We Face Risks Related to Our Strategic Resource Allocation DecisionsThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. The industry environment has moved toward an environment more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry. Variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. The variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment.Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 13Table of Contents Future Declines in the Semiconductor Industry, and the Overall World Economic Conditions on Which it is Significantly Dependent, Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOur business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. Global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including, but not limited to: •a decline in demand for our products or services;•an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us;•an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;•valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;•restructuring charges;•asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;•a decline in the value of our investments;•exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;•a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and•challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in R&D and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results Are VariableOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: •economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;•the size and timing of orders from customers;•consolidation of the customer base, which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services;•procurement shortages;•the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;•manufacturing difficulties;•customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, and/or customer acceptances;•the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;•our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;•changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 14Table of Contents •our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced, and competitive products;•our competitors’ introduction of new products;•legal or technical challenges to our products and technology;•transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters;•legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;•changes in our estimated effective tax rate;•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and•the dilutive impact of our Convertible Notes (as defined below) and related warrants on our earnings per share.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-Lived AssetsWe review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. During the 2015 fiscal year, our goodwill and long-lived asset impairment assessments resulted in an impairment charge of $79.4 million associated with the single-wafer clean reporting unit and $9.8 million related to an intangible asset. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations and Potential Note Conversion or Related Hedging Activities May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Earnings Per ShareWe have $4.55 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible note instruments outstanding. If the anticipated acquisition of KLA-Tencor is not completed on or prior to December 30, 2016, or the related merger agreement is terminated on or at any time prior to that date, the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes issued in June 2016 requires us to redeem $1.6 billion of those senior unsecured notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest.  In addition, in connection with the acquisition of KLA-Tencor, we have also entered into a term loan agreement with certain term lenders pursuant to which the term lenders have agreed to provide a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to $1.53 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions. If the anticipated acquisition of KLA-Tencor is not completed on or prior to October 20, 2016, we will need to obtain consent from all of the lenders under the term loan agreement to extend their commitments past this date. Additionally, we have $750 million available to us in revolving credit arrangements, with an option for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $250 million, for a potential total commitment of $1 billion.  We may, in the future, decide to borrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement, or to enter into additional debt arrangements.In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:•increased risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 15Table of Contents •increasing the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, particularly in the United States, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Conversion of our Convertible Notes and resulting exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share. The number of shares of our Common Stock into which the Convertible Notes are convertible for and the related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time, including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders. Upon conversion of any Convertible Notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, shares of our Common Stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. This dilution may not be completely mitigated by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of certain Convertible Notes or through share repurchases. Prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, if the price of our Common Stock exceeds the conversion price, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. The price of our Common Stock could also be affected by sales of our Common Stock by investors who view the Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our Common Stock by holders of the Convertible Notes.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability To Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;•create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, the Convertible Notes or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.We Have a Limited Number of Key CustomersSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. For the years ended June 26, 2016, June 28, 2015 and June 29, 2014, three customers collectively accounted for 45%, 51%, and 52% of total revenue, respectively. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict. In addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs and/or lower margins for us; compliance with specific environmental, social and corporate governance standards; and Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 16Table of Contents limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.We Depend on Creating New Products and Processes and Enhancing Existing Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change.Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. For over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. Moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices. This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue DiversificationWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. Our products are priced up to approximately $9.7 million per system, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:•a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;•a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;•export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets;•an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate;•increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;•technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 17Table of Contents additional risks associated with technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.Strategic Alliances and Customer Consolidation May Have Negative Effects on Our BusinessIncreasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. The outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment; while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors’ products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property.Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. Even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.We Depend On a Limited Number of Key Suppliers and Outsource Providers, and We Run the Risk That They Might Not Perform as We ExpectOutsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions, or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.Although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers, and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. There is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.We Face Risks Related to the Disruption of Our Primary Manufacturing FacilitiesOur manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations. These locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of our information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 18Table of Contents Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor’s Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to that CustomerSemiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool re-use. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.We Face a Challenging and Complex Competitive EnvironmentWe face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures. Other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers' needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.Our Future Success Depends Heavily on International Sales and the Management of Global OperationsNon-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 92%, 83%, and 86% of total revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.We are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:•trade balance issues;•tariffs and other barriers;•global or national economic and political conditions;•changes in currency controls;•differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;•our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 19Table of Contents •compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations; including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, environmental, and labor laws;•fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;•our ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner;•the need for technical support resources in different locations; and•our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. This would adversely affect our business with China, Taiwan, Japan, and/or South Korea and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. In addition, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things: insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. Currently, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities; primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed) and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) for these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with on-shore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 20Table of Contents we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of Our Business Which are Susceptible to Cybersecurity and Other Threats or IncidentsWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. Many of these information systems and outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data (e.g., company related, whether intellectual property or not; customer related; supplier related; and / or employee related) storage, employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an Internet-based service). All of these information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. Confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost and/or stolen. While we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures, such as virus protection software, intrusion prevention system and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control, they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, including our results of operations, and our reputation.Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesAs a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production, cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies as with our proposed acquisition of KLA-Tencor, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 21Table of Contents technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital, Make Acquisitions, or Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:•our ability to complete the contemplated acquisition of KLA-Tencor, or any delays thereto; •general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events and trends occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts, or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products;•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or•dilutive impacts of our Convertible Notes and related warrants.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 22Table of Contents Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes and techniques as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us, these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications, or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties, of ours or even our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the United States. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing, we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (i) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (ii) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (iii) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 23Table of Contents changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue To Declare Cash Dividends Or Repurchase Our Shares At All Or In Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability; in the case of share repurchases, contractual restrictions; and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. We currently are restricted from repurchasing our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend pursuant to the KLA-Tencor merger agreement. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.If We are Unable to Complete Our Contemplated Acquisition of KLA-Tencor Corporation, Our Expected Financial Results and the Market Value of our Common Stock Could Be Adversely AffectedOn October 20, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “merger agreement”) with KLA-Tencor to acquire all of KLA-Tencor’s issued and outstanding stock through a merger of KLA-Tencor with our subsidiaries, Topeka Merger Sub 1, Inc. and Topeka Merger Sub 3, Inc. (as assignee of Topeka Merger Sub 2, Inc.) (the “merger”). Consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. If any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed. We and KLA-Tencor also may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances. Any or all of the preceding could jeopardize our ability to consummate the merger on the already negotiated terms. To the extent the merger is not completed for any reason, we would have devoted substantial resources and management attention to the transaction without realizing the accompanying benefits expected by our management, and our financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our stock may be adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties associated with the merger include: •various conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied or waived;•the failure to consummate the merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community;•we and KLA-Tencor are subject to litigation related to the merger, and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, which may effect the merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame, or at all;•required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could cause the abandonment of the merger;•the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that would require us to pay KLA-Tencor a termination fee of up to $290 million;•the merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential acquirer of the Company;•our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about the timing of the merger or their future roles and relationships with us following the completion of the merger may be adversely affected;•the increase in our leverage and debt service obligations as a result of the assumption of KLA-Tencor’s debt and the incurrence of additional financing in connection with the merger may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share; and•the attention of our employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the merger; and disruptions from the merger, whether completed or not, may harm our relationships Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 24Table of Contents with our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers or other business partners, may impair our ability to continuously innovate to meet the industry inflections, and may result in a loss of or a substantial decrease in purchases by our customers.Even if the KLA-Tencor Merger is Consummated, We May Not Be Able to Integrate the Business of KLA-Tencor Successfully With our Own or Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the MergerThe merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of KLA-Tencor. Potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:•the inability to successfully combine our business with KLA-Tencor in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger;•required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may result in limitations, additional costs or placement of restrictions on the conduct of the combined company, imposition of additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger;•complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; and•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.In addition, we have operated and, until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in:•diversion of the attention of our management; and•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies,any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.The Future Results of the Combined Company Will Suffer if the Combined Company Does Not Effectively Manage its Expanded Operations Following the MergerFollowing the merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or KLA-Tencor’s business. The combined company’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.The Combined Company is Expected to Incur Substantial Expenses Related to the Merger With and the Integration of KLA-TencorWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger with and the integration of KLA-Tencor. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, marketing and benefits. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our or their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 25Table of Contents charges against earnings following the completion of the merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.The Merger May Result In a Loss of Customers or Strategic AlliancesAs a result of the merger, some of the customers, potential customers or strategic partners of ours or KLA-Tencor may terminate or scale back their business relationship with the combined company. Some customers may not wish to source a larger percentage of their needs from a single company, or may feel that we or KLA-Tencor, as applicable, and thus the combined company is too closely allied with one of their competitors. Potential customers or strategic partners may delay entering into, or decide not to enter into, a business relationship with the combined company because of the merger. If customer relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the merger, the combined company’s business and financial performance could suffer.Third Parties May Terminate or Alter Existing Contracts with KLA-TencorKLA-Tencor has contracts with suppliers, distributors, customers, licensors, licensees, lessors and other business partners that have “change of control” or similar clauses that allow the counterparty to terminate or change the terms of their contract upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We or KLA-Tencor may seek to obtain consent from these other parties, but if these third party consents are not obtained, or are obtained on unfavorable terms, the combined company may lose the benefit of such contracts, including benefits that may be material to the business of the combined company.Our Indebtedness Following Completion of the Merger Will Be Substantially Greater Than Our Indebtedness on a Stand-alone Basis and Greater Than Our and KLA-Tencor's Combined Indebtedness Existing Prior to the Merger. This Increased Level of Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Us, Including by Decreasing Our Business Flexibility, And Will Increase Our Borrowing Costs. Downgrades in Our Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Cash Flows, Financial Condition and/or Operating Results.We intend to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and related fees and expenses and to prepay KLA-Tencor’s term loan with a combination of the combined companies’ balance sheet cash and proceeds of approximately $4 billion under the term loans, the revolving credit agreement and debt securities. In connection with the anticipated KLA-Tencor merger, we also expect to offer to holders of KLA-Tencor's outstanding $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "KLA-Tencor Senior Notes") new series of our senior unsecured notes in exchange for the KLA-Tencor Senior Notes. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs. In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness or that of KLA-Tencor individually prior to the merger. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in product development as well as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds. Each of the ratings agencies reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and/or operating results.There Can Be No Assurance that We Will be Able to Maintain the Financing We Intend to Use to Pay the Cash Portion of the Consideration for the Merger.We have (1) entered into a senior unsecured term loan agreement which provides up to $1.53 million in term loans, subject to certain conditions; and (2) issued $2.4 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes. We have also entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing revolving credit agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the revolving lenders agreed to increase their aggregate commitments under the revolving credit agreement from $300 million to $750 million. Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 26Table of Contents We intend to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and related fees and expenses and to prepay KLA-Tencor’s outstanding term loans with a combination of the combined companies’ balance sheet cash and proceeds of approximately $4 billion under the term loans, from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the revolving credit agreement. The availability of the term loans is subject to certain conditions precedent and will terminate on October 20, 2016 if the merger has not been consummated by such date. In addition, if the merger with KLA-Tencor is not completed on or prior to December 30, 2016, or if the merger agreement is terminated on or prior to such date, we will be required to redeem $1.6 billion principal amount of senior notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption feature of such notes. Our obligation to complete the merger is not subject to a financing contingency. In the event that we and KLA-Tencor were to agree to extend the period of time in which to close the merger beyond October 20, 2016, there can be no assurance that we would be able to extend the availability of the term loans beyond that date.  In the event that the term loans are not available, or in the event of the special mandatory redemption of certain of our senior notes, other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to secure alternative financing, the merger may not be completed or we could find it necessary to fund the merger, related fees and expenses, and the prepayment of KLA-Tencor’s outstanding term loans from other sources of liquidity, or we could be liable to KLA-Tencor for breach of the merger agreement in connection with our failure to consummate the merger.Any delay in completing the KLA-Tencor Merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder. In addition to the required regulatory clearances, the KLA-Tencor merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our and KLA-Tencor’s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the KLA-Tencor Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the KLA-Tencor Merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies that we and KLA-Tencor expect to achieve if the KLA-Tencor Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. Neither we nor KLA-Tencor will be obligated to close the KLA-Tencor Merger if the KLA-Tencor Merger is not consummated by October 20, 2016. Item 1B
