GENERALAlliant Energy was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1981 and maintains its principal executive offices in Madison, Wisconsin.  Alliant Energy operates as a regulated investor-owned public utility holding company.  Alliant Energy’s primary focus is to provide regulated electric and natural gas service to approximately 950,000 electric and approximately 410,000 natural gas customers in the Midwest through its two public utility subsidiaries, IPL and WPL.  The primary first tier wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alliant Energy are: IPL, WPL, Resources and Corporate Services.  A brief description of the primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy is as follows:1) IPL - was incorporated in 1925 in Iowa as Iowa Railway and Light Corporation.  IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Iowa.  IPL provides utility services to incorporated communities as directed by the IUB and utilizes non-exclusive franchises, which cover the use of public right-of-ways for utility facilities in incorporated communities for a maximum term of 25 years.  At December 31, 2015, IPL supplied electric and natural gas service to approximately 489,000 and 225,000 retail customers, respectively, in Iowa.  IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa.  IPL is also engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  In 2015, 2014 and 2013, IPL had no single customer for which electric, gas, steam and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of IPL’s consolidated revenues.2) WPL - was incorporated in 1917 in Wisconsin as Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company.  WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Wisconsin.  WPL operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of indefinite duration and state statutes authorizing utility operation in areas annexed by a municipality.  At December 31, 2015, WPL supplied electric and natural gas service to approximately 461,000 and 184,000 retail customers, respectively.  WPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Wisconsin.  In 2015, 2014 and 2013, WPL had no single customer for which electric, gas and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of WPL’s consolidated revenues.  WPL’s consolidated subsidiary, WPL Transco, holds Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC.  Refer to Note 6(a) for further discussion of ATC.3) RESOURCES - was incorporated in 1988 in Wisconsin.  In 2008, Resources was converted to a limited liability company.  Alliant Energy’s non-regulated investments are organized under Resources.  Refer to “Information Relating to Non-regulated Operations” for additional details.4) CORPORATE SERVICES - was incorporated in 1997 in Iowa.  Corporate Services provides administrative services to Alliant Energy, IPL, WPL and Resources.Refer to Note 17 for further discussion of business segments, which information is incorporated herein by reference.B. INFORMATION RELATING TO ALLIANT ENERGY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS1) EMPLOYEES - At December 31, 2015, Alliant Energy’s consolidated subsidiaries had the following full- and part-time employees: Number of Number of Total Percentage of Employees Bargaining Unit Other Number of Covered by Collective Employees Employees Employees Bargaining AgreementsIPL1,103 584 1,687 65%WPL1,117 241 1,358 82%Corporate Services26 886 912 3%Resources88 25 113 78% 2,334 1,736 4,070 57%5Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2015, Alliant Energy employees covered by collective bargaining agreements were as follows: Number of Contract Employees Expiration DateIPL:   IBEW Local 204 (Cedar Rapids)785 8/31/17IBEW - Various318 Various 1,103  WPL - IBEW Local 9651,117 5/31/19Resources and Corporate Services - Various114 Various 2,334  2) CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND INVESTMENT PLANS - Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in MDA for discussion of anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for 2016 through 2019.3) REGULATION - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies.  The following includes the primary regulations impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.FERC -Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 - Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities, service company and other entities regulated by FERC.  Corporate Services, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 for various matters including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books, records and accounting requirements.Energy Policy Act - The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC designated North American Electric Reliability Corporation as the overarching Electric Reliability Organization.  Midwest Reliability Organization, which is a regional member of North American Electric Reliability Corporation, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.Federal Power Act - FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and transmission rates, dividend payments, issuance of IPL’s securities, and accounting practices of Corporate Services, IPL and WPL.Electric Wholesale Rates - IPL and WPL have received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from FERC.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of electricity within the MISO market and in transactions directly with third parties, based on the market value of the transactions.  IPL and WPL also have FERC-approved cost-of-service based rates related to the provision of firm full- and partial-requirement wholesale electric sales.  Both IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale cost-of-service tariffs are formula-based tariffs that allow for true-ups to actual costs, including fuel costs.Electric Transmission Rates - FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  Neither IPL nor WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates.  IPL and WPL rely primarily on the use of the ITC and ATC transmission systems, respectively.  Due to the formula rates used by ITC and ATC to charge their customers and possible future changes to these rates, there is uncertainty regarding IPL’s and WPL’s future electric transmission service expense.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for further discussion of electric transmission service expense.Natural Gas Act - FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.IUB - IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, sales of assets with values that exceed 3% of IPL’s revenues, and approval of the location and construction of EGUs.6Table of ContentsRetail Utility Base Rates - IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate changes.  These filings are based on historical test periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable changes to capital investments, cost of capital and operating and maintenance expenses consistent with IUB rules and regulations.  Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10 days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on previously established regulatory principles.  The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate changes within 10 months of the date of the application for which changes are filed, or the interim rates granted become permanent.Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms - IPL’s retail electric and natural gas tariffs contain automatic adjustment clauses for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers.  Any over- or under-collection of commodity costs are revised monthly and automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery Mechanism - Electric transmission service expense is billed to IPL’s retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider.  This cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expense.  Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are revised annually and reflected in future billings to customers.  The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s final decision in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, at which time the rider will continue in its current form, continue in a modified form or be terminated.Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Mechanism - In accordance with Iowa law, IPL is required to file an EEP every five years with the IUB.  An EEP provides a utility’s plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of energy savings.  IUB approval demonstrates that IPL’s EEP is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective delivery of the energy efficiency programs.  To the extent approved by the IUB, costs associated with executing the EEP are recovered from ratepayers through an additional tariff called an EECR factor.  The EECR factors are revised annually and include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expense from prior periods.Electric Generating Units - IPL must obtain a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUB in order to construct a new, or significantly alter an existing, EGU located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of capacity.  IPL’s ownership and operation of EGUs (including those located outside the state of Iowa) to serve Iowa customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the IUB.Gas Pipeline Projects - IPL must obtain a pipeline permit from the IUB related to the siting of utility gas pipelines in Iowa that will be operated at a pressure over 150 pounds per square inch and will transport gas from a gathering or storage facility to a distribution system or single, large volume customer.Advance Rate-making Principles - Iowa law provides Iowa utilities with rate-making principles prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa.  As a result, IPL may file for, and the IUB must render a decision on, rate-making principles for EGUs located in Iowa, including new base-load (nuclear or coal-fired generation) EGUs with a nameplate generating capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired EGUs and renewable generating resources, such as wind facilities.  Upon approval of rate-making principles by the IUB, IPL must either build the EGU under the approved rate-making principles, or not at all.Electric Generating Unit Environmental Controls Projects - IPL is required to submit an updated EPB biennially to the IUB setting out a multi-year plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its coal-fired EGUs in a cost-effective manner.  IPL must simultaneously submit this plan and budget to the Iowa DNR for a determination of whether the plan and budget meet state environmental requirements for regulated emissions.  The reasonable costs associated with implementing the approved plan are expected to be included in IPL’s future retail electric rates.PSCW - Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other matters.  WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, affiliate transactions, approval of the location and construction of EGUs and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.7Table of ContentsRetail Utility Base Rates - WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate changes.  These filings are required to be based on forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide retail base rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts to process retail base rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.  Currently, WPL is required to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds certain levels and is allowed to request a change in retail base rates if its annual return on common equity falls below a certain level.Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -Electric - WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of annual fuel-related costs anticipated during the forward-looking test period.  During each retail electric rate proceeding, or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding, the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges.  Deferrals of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the applicable authorized return on common equity.  Subject to review and approval by the PSCW, any deferred over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs for each year are reflected in future billings to retail customers.Natural Gas - WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas costs required to serve its retail gas customers.  Any over- or under-collection of natural gas costs are revised monthly and automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery - WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of electric transmission service expense anticipated during the forward-looking test period.  A majority of WPL’s electric transmission service expense is currently subject to a reconciliation of such estimated amounts to actual costs incurred with any difference deferred for inclusion in future base rate changes.Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery - WPL contributes a certain percentage of its annual utility revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin’s state-wide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program.  Estimated contributions to Focus on Energy, along with WPL-run energy efficiency program costs, are recovered from WPL’s retail customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings and include a reconciliation of such estimated amounts to actual costs incurred with any difference deferred for inclusion in a future base rate proceeding.New Electric Generating Units - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new EGU with a capacity of less than 100 MW and a project cost of $10 million or more.  WPL must obtain a CPCN from the PSCW in order to construct a new EGU in Wisconsin with a capacity of 100 MW or more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of EGUs (including those located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.Electric Generating Unit Upgrades - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any additions to EGUs, including environmental controls projects.  The current PSCW rules require a CA application for such projects with an estimated project cost of $10 million or more.Electric Distribution Projects - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of electric distribution projects with an estimated project cost of $10 million or more.Gas Distribution Projects - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of gas projects with an estimated project cost of $2.5 million or more and at any time that WPL requests to extend gas service to a new portion of its service territory.Advance Rate-making Principles - Wisconsin law provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate-making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled EGU or renewable generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.  WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate-making terms or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.8Table of ContentsMPUC - IPL is subject to limited regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in Minnesota for various matters including, but not limited to, approval of the location and construction of EGUs located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.  Refer to Note 3 for discussion of IPL’s sales of its Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets in 2015.Environmental - Extensive environmental laws and regulations are applicable as a result of current and past operations.  The environmental laws and regulations relate to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing air emissions; water discharges; the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials; and the clean-up of contaminated sites, including former MGP sites.The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management, transportation and clean-up, and solid waste management requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental programs to local agencies.Federal, state and local permits are regularly obtained to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the future.  Prudently incurred compliance and remediation costs for IPL and WPL are anticipated to be recoverable, in whole or part, through future rate case proceedings.  Refer to “Environmental Matters” in MDA and Note 16(e) for further discussion of electric and gas environmental matters, including current or proposed environmental regulations.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for details of future environmental compliance plans to adhere to applicable environmental requirements.Refer to Notes 1(b), 1(g), 2 and 16(e) and “Rate Matters” and “Environmental Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and utility rate matters.4) STRATEGIC OVERVIEW - Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of various strategic actions by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.C. INFORMATION RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONSAlliant Energy’s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL’s steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business.  IPL’s and WPL’s operating revenues and operating income (loss) for these three utility business segments were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 IPL WPL IPL WPL IPL WPL Revenue Income Revenue Income Revenue Income Revenue Income Revenue Income Revenue IncomeElectric85% 91% 88% 96% 81% 80% 84% 92% 82% 82% 85% 92%Gas12% 7% 12% 5% 16% 12% 15% 9% 15% 14% 14% 9%Other3% 2% —% (1%) 3% 8% 1% (1%) 3% 4% 1% (1%) 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONSGeneral - Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing retail electric service in Iowa and WPL providing retail and wholesale electric service in Wisconsin.  IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa.  In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets.  Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the sale.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding electric utility operations.Jurisdictions - The percentage of regulated electric utility revenues were as follows: IPL WPL 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013IUB93% 93% 93% —% —% —%PSCW—% —% —% 87% 86% 85%MPUC3% 5% 5% —% —% —%FERC4% 2% 2% 13% 14% 15% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%9Table of ContentsCustomers - The number of electric customers at December 31, 2015 was as follows: Retail Wholesale Other Total Customers Customers Customers CustomersIPL488,582 8 1,042 489,632WPL461,466 21 1,859 463,346 950,048 29 2,901 952,978IPL and WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the food manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol) and paper industries.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and other costs required to serve customers.  Electric transmission service expense is billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider.  IPL’s fuel-related costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in electric infrastructure and recovery of fuel-related costs, electric transmission service costs and other costs required to serve customers.  Refer to Note 2 and “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of utility rate cases.Wholesale customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings.  The tariffs include an annual true-up process for actual costs incurred.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of recent agreements with certain of WPL’s electric wholesale customers related to its proposed Riverside expansion.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for discussion of notifications provided to each of IPL and WPL to terminate certain of their wholesale power supply agreements.  Refer to Note 3 for discussion of a wholesale power supply agreement between IPL and Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative, which became effective upon the sale of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution assets in 2015.Seasonality - Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements.  Electric sales are also impacted to a certain extent in the winter months due to heating requirements.  Maximum peak hour demands were as follows: 2015 2014 Summer Peak Winter Peak Summer Peak Winter Peak MW Date MW Date MW Date MW DateAlliant Energy5,385 July 13 4,668 January 7 5,426 July 22 4,803 January 6IPL3,005 July 13 2,531 January 7 2,840 September 4 2,601 January 6WPL2,564 August 14 2,153 January 7 2,594 July 22 2,202 January 6Competition - Retail electric customers in Iowa and Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier, and IPL and WPL have obligations to serve all their retail electric customers.  Although electric service in Iowa and Wisconsin is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, customer- and third party-owned generation (e.g. solar panels), alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).  In addition, IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale customers may choose to purchase their electric energy and capacity needs from the MISO market, independent power producers or other utilities.  However, IPL and WPL attempt to retain current customers and attract new customers into their service territories in an effort to keep energy rates low for all their customers.Renewable Energy Standards - As discussed in greater detail below, the states in which IPL and WPL operate have RES, which establish the amount of energy electric utilities or service providers must supply from renewable resources.IPL - The Iowa RES requires IPL to purchase or own 49.8 MW of nameplate capacity from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in its Iowa service area.  IPL primarily relies upon RECs generated from the wind projects it owns and renewable energy acquired under PPAs to meet such requirements.  IPL currently exceeds the RES requirement.10Table of ContentsWPL - The Wisconsin RES requires WPL to increase the portion of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in 2001, 2002 and 2003.  The RES required a 6% increase above the benchmark by 2015.  Based on this RES, WPL was required to supply a minimum of 9.28% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by 2015.  WPL may reach the RES with renewable energy it generates, it acquires under PPAs or through the use of renewable resource credits.  WPL met the 2015 requirements of the RES with its current renewable portfolio, which primarily consists of wind and hydro, as well as the use of excess renewable resource credits generated from previous years.  A confirmation on WPL meeting the 2015 renewable requirements is expected from the PSCW in the second half of 2016.Energy Efficiency - IPL and WPL continue to promote energy efficiency, including their customers’ ability to efficiently manage their energy use.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of energy efficiency programs at IPL and WPL.Electric Supply - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have met historical customer demand of electricity and expect to continue meeting future demand through a mix of electric supply including internally generated electricity, PPAs and additional purchases from wholesale energy markets.  Alliant Energy’s mix of electric supply has changed with WPL’s purchases of Wisconsin Electric Power Company’s 25% interest in Edgewater Unit 5 in 2011 and Riverside in 2012, the completion of wind projects including WPL’s Bent Tree wind farm in 2011, the expiration of WPL’s Kewaunee PPA in December 2013, IPL’s DAEC PPA for a term from February 2014 through December 2025, WPL’s 150 MW PPA for a term from January 2014 through December 2018, the switch from coal to natural gas as the fuel type at IPL’s M.L. Kapp Unit 2 in June 2015 and IPL’s and WPL’s retirement of various EGUs.  Alliant Energy expects its mix of electric supply to change further in the next several years with IPL’s construction of Marshalltown, WPL’s proposed construction of the Riverside expansion, WPL’s retirement of Nelson Dewey Units 1 and 2 and Edgewater Unit 3 in December 2015, and the proposed retirement of additional EGUs.  Generation plans are periodically updated to identify longer term electric supply resource needs.  These long-term generation plans are intended to meet customer demand, reduce reliance on wholesale market purchases and mitigate the impacts of future EGU retirements while maintaining compliance with long-term electric demand planning reserve margins, environmental requirements and RES established by regulators.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to meet utility customer demand in the future.  However, unanticipated regional or local reliability issues could still arise in the event of unexpected delays in the construction of new generating and/or transmission facilities, retirement of EGUs, EGU outages, transmission system outages or extended periods of extreme weather conditions.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for a profile of the sources of electric supply used to meet customer demand from 2011 to 2015.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for details of future generation plans.Sources of Electric Energy - Sources of electric energy were approximately as follows: 2015 2014 2013 IPL WPL Total IPL WPL Total IPL WPL TotalInternally generated coal-fired EGUs38% 46% 42% 43% 47% 45% 41% 56% 48%Purchased power46% 28% 37% 47% 33% 40% 49% 29% 40%Internally generated natural gas-fired EGUs12% 20% 15% 6% 13% 10% 6% 9% 7%Internally generated wind farms4% 5% 5% 4% 5% 5% 4% 5% 4%Other—% 1% 1% —% 2% —% —% 1% 1% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin - IPL and WPL are required to maintain a planning reserve margin above their load at the time of the MISO-wide peak to ensure reliability of electric service to their customers.  The required installed capacity reserve margin is 15.2% and the required unforced capacity reserve margin is 7.6% for the June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017 MISO planning year.  IPL and WPL currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO planning reserve margin requirements for the June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017 MISO planning year.Generation - IPL and WPL own a portfolio of EGUs located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to “Properties” in Item 2 for details of IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs.11Table of ContentsNameplate Capacity - At December 31, the nameplate capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs by primary fuel type was as follows: 2015 2014 IPL WPL Total IPL WPL Total MWs % MWs % MWs % MWs % MWs % MWs %Natural gas1,249 39% 1,448 50% 2,697 44% 1,031 32% 1,448 45% 2,479 39%Coal1,423 44% 1,167 40% 2,590 42% 1,641 51% 1,463 46% 3,104 48%Oil343 11% — —% 343 6% 347 11% — —% 347 5%Wind200 6% 269 9% 469 8% 200 6% 269 8% 469 7%Hydro— —% 41 1% 41 —% — —% 41 1% 41 1%Total3,215 100% 2,925 100% 6,140 100% 3,219 100% 3,221 100% 6,440 100%Fuel Costs - The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric generation was as follows: IPL WPL 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013All fuels$2.21 $2.50 $2.36 $2.67 $2.82 $2.52Coal1.94 2.05 1.99 2.49 2.22 2.21Natural gas (a)3.37 6.05 4.63 3.68 5.51 4.86(a)The average cost of natural gas includes commodity and transportation costs as well as realized gains and losses from swap and option contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by IPL’s and WPL’s natural gas-fired EGUs.Coal - Coal is a primary fuel source for internally generated electric supply.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired EGUs for 2016 through 2018.  As of December 31, 2015, existing contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 79%, 55% and 33% of IPL’s and WPL’s estimated aggregate annual coal supply needs for 2016 through 2018, respectively.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe this portfolio of coal supplies represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes.  Remaining coal requirements are expected to be met from either future term contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Alliant Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters into various coal transportation agreements to meet IPL’s and WPL’s coal supply requirements.  As of December 31, 2015, existing coal transportation agreements cover IPL’s and WPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2016 and 2017.  In 2015 and 2016, two of Alliant Energy’s coal suppliers filed for restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  There has been no significant impact to Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL as a result of these bankruptcy filings.Nearly all of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s EGUs, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply targets of 25 to 55 days for EGUs with year-round deliveries and 30 to 125 days (depending upon the time of year) for EGUs with seasonal deliveries.  As of December 31, 2015, actual inventory days ranged from 29 to 92 days for EGUs with year-round deliveries and were 161 days for an EGU with seasonal deliveries.  The EGU days on hand were computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by estimated average daily tons burned.  Coal inventory levels have been impacted by lower natural gas prices, which makes natural gas-fired generation more economical compared to other fuel sources, such as coal.  Coal inventory levels have also been impacted by lower electric demand due to milder temperatures in the fourth quarter of 2015.Average delivered coal costs moderately declined during the last half of 2015 due to downward rail rate adjustments, lower rail fuel surcharges to historic low levels and lower spot market coal prices.  However, average delivered coal costs are expected to slightly increase in the future due to price structures and adjustment provisions in existing coal contracts, in conjunction with expected rising market prices; rate structures and adjustment provisions in existing transportation contracts; and expected future coal and transportation market trends.  Existing coal commodity contracts with terms of greater than one year have fixed future year prices that generally reflect recent market trends.  Rate adjustment provisions in current rail transportation contracts are based on changes in the All Inclusive Index Less Fuel as published by the Association of American Railroads.  These transportation contracts also contain fuel surcharges that are subject to change monthly based on changes in diesel fuel prices, which are currently at low levels.  Other factors that may impact coal prices for future 12Table of Contentscommitments are increasing costs for supplier mineral rights, increasing costs to mine the coal, and changes in various associated laws and regulations.  For example, emission restrictions related to SO2, NOx and mercury, along with other environmental limitations on EGUs, continue to increase and will likely limit the ability to obtain, and further increase the cost of, adequate coal supplies.  Factors that may impact future transportation rates include, but are not limited to: the possible need for railroads to enhance and expand infrastructure, corresponding investments in locomotives and crews, and the desire to improve margins on coal movements commensurate with margins on non-coal movements.Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms.  The coal procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier diversity.  Similarly, given the term lengths of their transportation agreements and strategic alignment of agreement expirations for negotiation purposes, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.Natural Gas - Alliant Energy owns several larger natural gas-fired EGUs, including IPL’s Emery (603 MW), WPL’s Riverside (675 MW), WPL’s Neenah (371 MW) and Resources’ Sheboygan Falls (347 MW) facilities.  WPL has exclusive rights to the output of Sheboygan Falls under an affiliated lease agreement.  IPL and WPL also currently own several smaller natural gas-fired EGUs, including IPL’s M.L. Kapp Unit 2 (218 MW) for which the fuel type was switched from coal to natural gas in June 2015.  These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands and when natural gas prices are low enough to make natural gas-fired generation economical compared to other fuel sources, such as occurred in 2015.  Alliant Energy manages the gas supply to these gas-fired EGUs and provides supply through a combination of third-party deliveries and pipeline transportation and storage contracts held by IPL and WPL.  IPL and WPL have contracts to provide storage capacity, as well as firm pipeline transportation per day, as follows (in Dths): Storage Firm Pipeline Capacity TransportationRiverside2,500,000 80,000Emery1,250,000 60,000In addition, IPL and WPL have each purchased 5,000 Dths per day of fixed price physical natural gas commodities for Emery and Riverside, respectively, for a five-year term from 2016 through 2020.  These purchases represent less than 10% of the expected gas needs of these EGUs.Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of IPL’s construction of Marshalltown and WPL’s proposed construction of the Riverside expansion, both of which are natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGUs.Wind - IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind farm in Franklin County, Iowa began generating electricity in 2009.  WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind farm in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began generating electricity in 2008.  WPL’s 201 MW Bent Tree wind farm in Freeborn County, Minnesota began full generation of electricity in 2011.  All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be used in future years to comply with RES or other regulatory requirements, or sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities.  Refer to “Properties” in Item 2 for the generating capacity of these wind farms.Purchased Power - IPL and WPL periodically enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for electricity.  IPL’s most significant PPA is for the purchase of up to 431 MWs of capacity and the resulting energy from DAEC for a term from February 2014 through December 2025.  WPL’s most significant PPA is for the purchase of 150 MWs of energy for a term from January 2014 through December 2018.IPL’s DAEC PPA - In 2013, the IUB issued an order allowing IPL to proceed with a PPA for the purchase of capacity and energy generated by DAEC located near Palo, Iowa.  The IUB also authorized IPL to recover the Iowa retail portion of the cost of the DAEC PPA from Iowa retail electric customers through the energy adjustment clause.  The terms of the PPA provide IPL the right to the counterparty’s entire output quantities (70% of the total plant output) in exchange for payment from IPL to the counterparty based on the amount of MWhs received by IPL.  Among the terms and conditions of the PPA are guarantees by the counterparty to provide minimum amounts of capacity and energy.  The PPA also contains provisions for the replacement of energy from alternative sources under certain conditions as well as provisions that convey to IPL the potential environmental attributes associated with its portion of the output from DAEC.13Table of ContentsRefer to Note 1(g) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of fuel-related costs and Note 16(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments.Electric Transmission - IPL and WPL do not own electric transmission assets and currently receive substantially all their electric transmission services from ITC and ATC, respectively.  ITC and ATC are independent for-profit, transmission-only companies and are transmission-owning members of the MISO Regional Transmission Organization, Midwest Reliability Organization and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  The annual transmission service rates that ITC and ATC charge their customers are calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.”  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ITC and ATC.  Refer to Note 1(g) for discussion of a transmission cost rider utilized by IPL for recovery of its electric transmission service expense, and discussion of WPL’s electric transmission service expense, which is recovered from its retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings.  Note 1(g) also discusses escrow accounting treatment for electric transmission service expense, which WPL received as part of its approved retail electric rate case (2015/2016 Test Period) in July 2014 from the PSCW.  Refer to Note 18 for details of agreements between ATC and WPL.ATC - WPL Transco, which is partially owned by WPL and Resources’ subsidiary, ATI, has an ownership interest in ATC.  WPL Transco’s capital contributions to ATC are currently funded by ATI, and are included in “Other” in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in MDA.  Alliant Energy currently anticipates that ATI will fund capital contributions of approximately $20 million, $21 million, $3 million and $0 to ATC in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, to help fund future proposed transmission projects.  These future proposed transmission projects require approval from various regulatory agencies to construct.  Certain of these future proposed transmission projects are currently being challenged by other utilities and other transmission-only companies who have requested to own a portion of the future transmission projects proposed by ATC.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine the impact these challenges may have on ATC’s plans to construct these proposed transmission projects and the resulting impact on ATI’s future capital contributions to ATC and WPL’s and ATI’s equity earnings income and dividends received from ATC.  In addition, refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for discussion of potential changes to ATC’s return on equity, which could result in Alliant Energy and WPL realizing lower equity income and dividends from ATC in the future.In 2011, Duke Energy Corporation and ATC announced the creation of DATC, a joint venture that is expected to acquire, build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America.  DATC continues to evaluate new projects and opportunities, and participates in a competitive bidding process on projects it considers to be viable.  DATC is continuing the design and development of a proposed transmission line that would deliver wind energy generated in eastern Wyoming to California and the southwestern U.S.  This transmission line is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine what impacts DATC and the transmission line project noted above, if constructed, will have on their future equity income, dividends received from ATC, capital contributions to ATC, or ownership in ATC.  The expenditures in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in MDA do not include any capital contributions for potential DATC projects.MISO Markets - IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organization, which is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories.  IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are discussed in more detail below.  Corporate Services acts as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL pursuant to service agreements.  As agent, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission sale and purchase transactions within the markets operated by MISO.  Corporate Services assigns such sales and purchases between IPL and WPL based on statements received from MISO.  Refer to Note 18 for additional discussion of these assigned amounts.Wholesale Energy Market - IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO.  The market dictates the process by which IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load.  In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy.  MISO evaluates IPL’s, WPL’s and other market participants’ offers, bids and energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders about where generation or transmission system expansion is needed.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated based on economic needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for their variable costs.14Table of ContentsAncillary Services Market - IPL and WPL also participate in MISO’s ancillary services market.  The ancillary services market integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market.  Regulation reserves refer to generation available to meet the moment-to-moment changes in generation that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand.  Contingency reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either on-line or that can be brought on-line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major events such as the loss of a large EGU or transmission line.Financial Transmission Rights and Auction Revenue Rights - In areas of constrained transmission capacity, costs could be higher due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  FTRs provide a hedge for congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market.  MISO allocates ARRs to IPL and WPL each year based on historical use of the transmission system.  The revenue rights associated with the allocated ARRs are used by IPL and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by MISO.  MISO allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31.  IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through May 31, 2016.Multi-value Projects - The MISO tariff identifies costs billed to IPL and WPL, including costs related to various shared transmission projects, including MVPs.  MVPs include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within MISO.  MVP costs are socialized across the entire MISO footprint based on energy usage of each MISO participant.  The MISO tariff billed to IPL and WPL also includes costs related to other shared transmission projects, including projects designed to reduce market congestion, to provide interconnection to the transmission grid for new generation, and to ensure compliance with applicable reliability standards.  The costs of these projects are primarily allocated to MISO participants in a way that is commensurate with the benefit to the participants’ pricing zone.  The MISO transmission charges billed to IPL and WPL are expected to increase in the future due to the increased number of shared transmission projects occurring in the MISO region.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations” in MDA for further discussion of MISO transmission charges billed to IPL and WPL.Resource Adequacy - MISO conducts various studies regarding reliability of electric service to ensure its market participants have adequate resources, either owned or contracted, to meet MISO’s forecasted peak load obligations plus a reserve margin.  Only accredited capacity assigned to EGUs from the MISO resource adequacy process is available to meet these requirements.  To connect to the transmission system, MISO requires an EGU to obtain an interconnection agreement.  In order for an EGU to receive accredited capacity, it must, among other requirements, satisfy all transmission requirements identified in its interconnection agreement prior to the MISO planning year.  New EGUs like Marshalltown may not initially receive accredited capacity based on the inability to satisfy all identified transmission requirements.  Therefore, accredited capacity may not be granted to such EGUs until all identified transmission requirements are resolved.  As members of MISO, IPL and WPL must adhere to these resource adequacy protocols in executing their generation resource plans.Attachment Y Notices and System Support Resources - MISO requires its market participants (including IPL and WPL, among others) who own EGUs to submit an Attachment Y Notice if they plan to retire an EGU, reduce the capacity of an EGU or suspend all or a portion of the operations of an EGU for a period longer than two months.  Upon receiving an Attachment Y Notice, MISO will conduct a study to determine whether all or a portion of the EGU’s capacity is necessary to maintain system reliability.  If the EGU’s capacity is determined to be necessary to maintain system reliability, MISO designates the EGU as an SSR.  When an EGU is required to continue to operate for system reliability, the market participant may enter into an SSR agreement and negotiate an annual revenue requirement with MISO.  The annual revenue requirement for the SSR is subject to FERC approval and is assigned to load serving entities that benefit from the continued operations of the EGU.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to estimate the amount of aggregate SSR charges that may be assigned to IPL and WPL as load serving entities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are also currently unable to estimate the impacts of any potential SSR designations on EGUs they plan to retire or modify.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of EGUs that IPL and WPL currently plan to retire or modify, such as changing from coal-fired to an alternative fuel source, in the next few years.  Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion of SSR costs.Electric Environmental Matters - Refer to Note 16(e) and “Environmental Matters” in MDA for discussion of electric environmental matters, including current or proposed environmental regulations.15Table of ContentsElectric Operating Information - Alliant Energy2015 2014 2013 2012 2011Operating Revenues (in millions) (a):         Residential$983.0 $994.5 $1,009.1 $975.9 $985.8Commercial667.8 658.0 649.4 611.4 612.1Industrial823.3 799.0 765.4 741.8 748.9Retail subtotal2,474.1 2,451.5 2,423.9 2,329.1 2,346.8Sales for resale:         Wholesale221.0 206.6 195.4 187.6 189.8Bulk power and other28.5 2.9 17.7 23.8 52.2Other46.9 52.6 52.0 48.8 47.0Total$2,770.5 $2,713.6 $2,689.0 $2,589.3 $2,635.8Electric Sales (000s MWh) (a):         Residential7,271 7,697 7,824 7,679 7,740Commercial6,374 6,449 6,432 6,352 6,253Industrial11,735 11,821 11,471 11,555 11,504Retail subtotal25,380 25,967 25,727 25,586 25,497Sales for resale:         Wholesale3,614 3,586 3,564 3,317 3,372Bulk power and other1,228 335 763 1,303 1,757Other129 155 152 151 151Total30,351 30,043 30,206 30,357 30,777Customers (End of Period) (a):         Residential809,634 850,322 847,350 844,388 842,780Commercial137,870 139,138 138,520 137,791 136,732Industrial2,544 2,871 2,881 2,842 2,895Other2,930 3,662 3,657 3,647 3,638Total952,978 995,993 992,408 988,668 986,045Other Selected Electric Data:         Maximum summer peak hour demand (MW)5,385 5,426 5,820 5,886 5,734Maximum winter peak hour demand (MW)4,668 4,803 4,648 4,368 4,423Cooling degree days (b):         Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IPL) (normal - 769)732 670 884 1,052 887Madison, Wisconsin (WPL) (normal - 663)665 620 709 1,070 814Sources of electric energy (000s MWh):         Coal13,040 13,818 14,873 14,680 16,440Purchased power:         Nuclear (c)3,741 3,133 5,544 5,483 5,483Wind (d)1,190 1,252 1,201 1,188 1,285Other (d)6,675 8,074 5,541 7,053 6,244Gas4,738 2,971 2,224 1,285 588Wind (d)1,441 1,390 1,375 1,198 1,188Other (d)189 212 200 183 225Total31,014 30,850 30,958 31,070 31,453Revenue per KWh sold to retail customers (cents)9.75 9.44 9.42 9.10 9.20(a)In 2015, Alliant Energy sold its electric distribution assets in Minnesota to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative.

Alliant Energy’s gas utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing gas service in Iowa and WPL providing gas service in Wisconsin.  In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota natural gas distribution assets.  Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the sale.  Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas utility operations.Customers - The number of gas customers at December 31, 2015 were as follows: Retail Transportation / Total Customers Other Customers CustomersIPL224,914 376 225,290WPL184,491 251 184,742 409,405 627 410,032IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB or PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in gas infrastructure and recovery of costs required to serve customers.  Commodity, storage and transportation costs incurred by IPL and WPL are recovered pursuant to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms.  In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs.Seasonality - Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer and inject it into underground storage fields, and remove it from storage fields in the winter to deliver to customers.  The maximum daily winter peak demands were as follows: 2015 2014 Dth Date Dth DateIPL267,314 January 7 296,190 January 6WPL209,289 January 7 234,837 January 6Competition - Gas customers in Iowa and Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their gas distributor, and IPL and WPL have obligations to serve all their gas customers.  Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third-parties.  When natural gas service is available for a given area, customers in such area have generally selected natural gas over propane as a more cost competitive solution for their energy needs.  Recently, lower natural gas prices compared to propane prices have resulted in increased customer requests to convert from propane to natural gas.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are also currently extending various gas distribution systems in their existing Iowa and Wisconsin service territories to serve new customer demand.  Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for further discussion of gas distribution systems.Gas Supply - IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 70 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Recently, IPL and WPL have each purchased 5,000 Dths per day of fixed price physical natural gas commodities for a five-year term from 2016 through 2020.In more recent years, natural gas prices have fallen to levels not seen in a decade.  Prices have fallen largely due to surging supply caused by shale gas production.  The tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates in the cost of gas sold.  As a result, the decreased natural gas prices do not have a material impact on IPL’s or WPL’s gas margins, but result in lower customer bills.19Table of ContentsIn providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with NNG, ANR, NGPL and NBPL allow access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements with FCS provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory.  In 2015, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths): NNG ANR NGPL FCS NBPL TotalIPL170,142 48,000 76,673 5,000 4,126 303,941WPL91,056 167,467 — — — 258,523Gas Demand Planning Reserve Margin - IPL and WPL are required to maintain adequate pipeline capacity to ensure they meet their customers’ maximum daily system demand requirements.  Both IPL and WPL currently have planning reserve margins of 2% above their forecasted maximum daily system demand requirements from November 2015 through March 2016.Refer to Note 1(g) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery mechanisms and Note 16(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments.Gas Environmental Matters - Refer to Note 16(e) and “Environmental Matters” in MDA for discussion of gas environmental matters.Gas Operating Information - Alliant Energy2015 2014 2013 2012 2011Operating Revenues (in millions) (a):         Residential$215.1 $287.5 $262.5 $224.3 $269.7Commercial120.5 172.8 150.3 124.3 155.1Industrial14.3 23.4 21.1 16.7 24.5Retail subtotal349.9 483.7 433.9 365.3 449.3Transportation/other31.3 33.8 30.9 31.0 27.4Total$381.2 $517.5 $464.8 $396.3 $476.7Gas Sales (000s Dths) (a):         Residential26,672 31,718 29,916 23,071 26,891Commercial18,966 23,301 21,892 17,115 19,271Industrial2,997 3,710 3,803 3,068 3,848Retail subtotal48,635 58,729 55,611 43,254 50,010Transportation/other74,162 64,717 60,261 57,532 52,210Total122,797 123,446 115,872 100,786 102,220Retail Customers at End of Period (a):         Residential364,415 373,319 370,895 368,708 367,497Commercial44,613 46,180 45,874 45,684 45,667Industrial377 428 441 456 496Total409,405 419,927 417,210 414,848 413,660Other Selected Gas Data:         Heating degree days (b):         Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IPL) (normal - 6,756)6,300 7,657 7,232 5,901 6,745Madison, Wisconsin (WPL) (normal - 7,046)6,667 7,884 7,627 5,964 6,992Revenue per Dth sold to retail customers$7.19 $8.24 $7.80 $8.45 $8.98Purchased gas costs per Dth sold to retail customers$4.40 $5.52 $4.90 $4.94 $5.88(a)In April 2015, Alliant Energy sold its natural gas distribution assets in Minnesota.

IPL’s largest high-pressure steam customer accounts for approximately 90% of IPL’s steam revenues.  This customer is under contract through 2025 for annual steam usage of at least 3.8 million Dths, with certain conditions.  IPL’s other high-pressure steam customer is under contract through 2025 for annual steam usage of at least 0.3 million Dths, with certain conditions.D. INFORMATION RELATING TO NON-REGULATED OPERATIONSResources manages a portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional investments through the following distinct platforms:Non-regulated Generation - owns Sheboygan Falls, a 347 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired EGU near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025, and the 99 MW Franklin County wind farm in Franklin County, Iowa.Transportation - includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; a barge terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.Other non-regulated investments - includes ATI’s partial ownership interest in WPL Transco, which holds Alliant Energy’s ownership interest in ATC, and several other modest investments.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, together with all of the other information contained in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities.  If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.Our business is significantly impacted by government legislation, regulation and oversight - We are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities, which significantly influences our operations and our ability to timely recover costs from customers and earn appropriate rates of return.  In particular, regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over public utilities, including the IUB, the PSCW, the MPUC and FERC, regulate many aspects of our operations.  Our operations are also subject to oversight and monitoring by organizations such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc.  Operations impacted by these regulatory authorities and organizations include: the amount and timing of changes to rates charged to our customers; rates of return of IPL, WPL and ATC; our ability to site and construct new generating facilities, such as the natural gas-fired generating facilities in Marshalltown, Iowa and Beloit, Wisconsin, and future renewable energy projects, projects to utilize our remaining available wind sites, and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; the installation of environmental controls and the amount of costs for the construction and maintenance of such equipment that may be recovered from customers; our ability to decommission generating facilities and recover the costs incurred to decommission the facilities and the remaining carrying value of such facilities; our ability to site and construct new natural gas pipelines; our ability to recover costs to upgrade our gas distribution system to comply with the anticipated Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration requirements that have not yet been finalized; the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources; our ability to purchase generating facilities and the amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers; our ability to sell utility assets and any conditions placed upon the sale of such assets; the rates paid to transmission operators and how those costs are recovered from customers; our ability to enter into purchased power agreements, the amount of costs associated therewith, and how those costs are recovered from customers; resource adequacy requirements, energy capacity standards, what forms of energy are considered when determining whether we meet those standards, and when new facilities such as IPL’s Marshalltown Generating Station and WPL’s proposed Riverside Energy Center expansion may be fully credited with energy capacity; the allocation of expenditures by transmission companies on transmission network upgrades and our ability to recover costs associated therewith from customers; reliability; safety; the issuance of securities; accounting matters; and transactions between affiliates.  Failure to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities and organizations for any of these matters, failure to receive approvals in a timely manner, or receiving approvals with uneconomical conditions may adversely impact our ability to achieve our strategic plan, cause us to record an impairment of our assets, and/or have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.These regulatory authorities and organizations are also empowered to impose financial penalties and other sanctions if we are found to have violated statutes and regulations governing utility operations.  While we believe we comply in all material 22Table of Contentsrespects with applicable laws and regulations governing us, state or federal agencies may not agree and may find that we violated a law or regulation.  Such a finding could cause fines or penalties or could require us to implement new compliance programs, which could increase our costs of compliance and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our utility financial condition is influenced by how regulatory authorities establish the rates we can charge our customers, our authorized rates of return and common equity levels, and the amount of deferred costs that may be recovered from customers.  Our ability to timely obtain rate adjustments to earn authorized rates of return depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or authorized rates of return on capital will be earned.  In future rate cases, IPL and WPL may not receive an adequate amount of rate relief to recover all costs and earn their authorized rates of return, rates may be reduced, rate refunds may be required, rate adjustments may not be approved on a timely basis, costs may not be otherwise recovered through rates, future rates may be temporarily frozen (as is the case for IPL’s and WPL’s retail electric base rates and WPL’s gas base rates through the end of 2016) and authorized rates of return on capital may be reduced.  As a result, we may experience adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a wide variety of statutes, regulations and rules for energy market operations, grid management and reliability, including and in addition to those described above, which are constantly changing.  State and federal election results may serve as a catalyst for legislative and regulatory changes.  Changes in statutes, regulations and rules or the imposition of additional regulations and rules may require us to incur additional costs or change business operations or our business plan, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility activities.  Takeover attempts by potential purchasers who might be willing to pay a premium for our stock are also limited by certain provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act and the delays and conditions that generally result from the requirement that regulatory authorities approve such a transaction.  During this time of industry change driven by technology and changing customer expectations, intentional or inadvertent policy changes could impact our business model competitiveness and accordingly our financial results.Large construction projects are subject to delays and cost increases that may not be recovered from customers - Our strategic plan includes constructing natural gas-fired generating facilities, constructing renewable generating facilities, installing environmental control equipment at our newer and more efficient coal-fired generating facilities, and making other large-scale improvements to such generating facilities and large-scale additions and upgrades to our electric and gas distribution systems.  These large construction projects are subject to various risks that could cause costs to increase or cause delays in completion.  These risks include changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities, fuel or labor; shortages in materials, equipment and qualified labor; changes to the scope or timing of the projects; general contractors or subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts; the inability to agree to contract terms or disputes in contract terms; poor initial cost estimates; work stoppages; adverse weather conditions; the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; governmental actions; legal action; unforeseen engineering or technology issues; limited access to capital; and other adverse economic conditions.  We may not be able to recover all costs for the projects in rates and face increased risk of potential impairment of our project investment if a construction project is not completed or is delayed, or final costs exceed the costs approved by our regulators, for example, if the Marshalltown Generating Station exceeds the cost cap approved by the IUB.  Inability to recover costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Demand for energy may decrease - Our results of operations are affected by the demand for energy in our service territories.  We could lose customers, and therefore see lower demand for energy, due to economic conditions, customers constructing their own generation facilities, higher costs and rates charged to customers, or loss of service territory or franchises.  Communities in our service territory have considered municipalization of electric or gas systems, which, if successful, could reduce the number of customers we serve, reducing the demand for our energy.  Further, the energy conservation and technological advances that increase energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for energy products.  In addition, state and/or federal regulations require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for energy.  We may lose wholesale customers in addition to Jo-Carroll Energy, Inc., WPPI Energy and Great Lakes Utilities who have provided us notice of their intent to terminate their wholesale power supply agreements.  Continuing technology improvements, tax incentives, regulatory developments and customer concern regarding their environmental and carbon footprint are making customer- and third party-owned generation technologies such as solar systems, wind turbines, microturbines and battery storage systems more cost effective, attractive and feasible for more of our 23Table of Contentscustomers.  As more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us may decline and negatively impact the affordability of our services for remaining customers.  Future economic growth may not create enough growth for us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers.  The loss of customers, the inability to replace those customers with new customers, and the decrease in demand for energy could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Regional and national economic conditions could have an unfavorable impact on us - Our utility and non-regulated businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with.  Adverse economic conditions in our service territories can adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and reduce their demand for electricity and natural gas.  Reduced volumes of electricity and natural gas sold, or the inability to collect unpaid bills from our customers from deterioration in national or regional economic conditions, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by the impacts of weather - Our electric and gas utilities are seasonal businesses and temperature patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance.  Demand for electricity is greater in the summer months associated with higher air conditioning needs.  In addition, market prices for electricity generally peak in the summer due to the higher demand.  Conversely, demand for natural gas depends significantly upon temperature patterns in winter months due to heavy use in residential and commercial heating.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, we have historically generated less revenues and income when temperatures are warmer in the winter and/or cooler in the summer.  Thus, unusually mild winters and/or summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which could be difficult and costly, and pursuant to which we could incur material liabilities - We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations.  The environmental laws and regulations govern air emissions, ambient air quality standards, water quality, cooling water intake structures, wastewater discharges, the generation, transport and disposal of coal combustion residuals and other solid wastes and hazardous substances, clean-up of contaminated sites, protection of natural resources and wildlife.  These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals, which are subject to renewal proceedings and legal challenges.  Environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or to combust certain fuels, to install environmental controls and implement operational practices at our facilities, manage generation system dispatch within emissions limitations and constraints, clean up spills and correct environmental hazards and other contamination.  We may be required to pay all or a portion of the costs to remediate (i.e., clean-up) sites where our past activities, or the activities of certain other parties, caused environmental contamination, including lakebeds, sites of manufactured gas plants operated by our predecessors and sites where asbestos was used in the past.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs and plant down-times, and can negatively affect the affordability of our services for customers.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of any fines or penalties, including the severity of any restriction on our operations) necessary to comply with, or as a result of liabilities under, these environmental laws and regulations, although we expect the expenditures to be material.We are subject to Consent Decrees between each of IPL and WPL and various environmental agencies and organizations, which resolved environmental claims related to air emissions at certain coal-fired generating facilities.  The Consent Decrees require construction of specific environmental controls equipment, establish emission rate limits, require retirement or fuel switching of certain facilities, and require IPL and WPL to complete certain environmental mitigation projects.Although we believe we comply in all material respects with currently applicable environmental laws, regulations, and the Consent Decrees, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action by state or federal agencies should we operate out of compliance.  In some instances, complying with certain environmental regulations may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Consent Decrees or other operating regulations discussed earlier.  In addition, citizen groups and private individuals may bring legal action against regulatory agencies or bring citizen enforcement actions against us claiming that the environmental requirements are not being sufficiently enforced by regulatory agencies.  For example, the Consent Decrees resulted from allegations originally raised by the Sierra Club that IPL and WPL violated various provisions of the Clean Air Act.  If we are unsuccessful defending or settling such litigation by governmental agencies, citizen groups, or individuals, we could be subject to restrictions or prohibitions on operating our generation facilities, costly upgrades to our generating facilities, payment of damages or fines, requirements to complete other beneficial environmental projects, and litigation costs, all of which could be material.  An adverse result in such legal actions could have a material adverse impact 24Table of Contentson our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we may also be subject to third party environmental claims relating to property damage or personal injury that arise from our operations.We are subject to existing and potential future governmental mandates to provide customers with renewable energy and energy conservation offerings.  These mandates are designed in part to mitigate the potential environmental impacts of utility operations.  Failure to meet the requirements of these mandates may result in fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations seeking to protect the environment and natural resources may be adopted or become applicable to us.  Areas in our service territories that are currently attainment areas under National Ambient Air Quality Standards could be designated as non-attainment areas due to new air monitoring results or more stringent air quality standards.  These revised and new laws or regulations and any areas in our service territories designated as non-attainment may require regulation of hazardous air pollutants including mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, particulate matter, coal ash and other coal combustion products, wastewater discharges, cooling water intake structures, and threatened, endangered or invasive species.  Federal and state election results may serve as a catalyst for regulatory changes.  Such changes could materially increase our cost of compliance.  Our strategic plan was developed in part to comply with expected environmental laws and regulations as we anticipate they will be finally adopted.  Revision of existing environmental laws or regulations may cause: (1) state utility commissions to not approve our plans to install environmental controls at our existing generating facilities or not allow us to recover costs of such projects; (2) state utility commissions to not approve costs of emission allowances purchased to comply with environmental regulations that are no longer applicable to our operations; (3) co-owners in our jointly-owned facilities to not agree with our decision to move forward with and the timing of these projects; or (4) our current plans and/or past actions to not meet new requirements.  These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Actions related to global climate change and reducing GHG emissions could negatively impact us - The primary GHG emitted from our utility operations is CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels at our electric generating facilities, which are primarily fossil-fueled facilities.  We could incur costs or other obligations to comply with any GHG regulations that are adopted in the future, and could become the target of legal claims or challenges, because generating electricity using fossil fuels emits CO2 and other GHGs.  In 2013, a series of actions were announced to reduce carbon emissions, prepare the U.S. for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to address climate change.  In 2015, the U.S. joined a global agreement that commits participating countries to setting nationally determined climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and establishes a framework for reporting progress towards achieving these goals.The EPA has proposed and adopted regulations governing GHG emissions that are expected to impact our operations.  In October 2015, the EPA published regulations governing GHG emissions from new generating facilities, which would impact IPL’s Marshalltown Generating Station in Iowa and WPL’s proposed Riverside Energy Center expansion in Wisconsin.  In October 2015, the EPA published regulations under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating facilities, otherwise known as the Clean Power Plan.  These EPA regulations are based on broad measures to lower CO2 emissions, which could impact the dispatch of existing fossil-fueled generating facilities and the fuel mix used to generate electricity, and require other actions in order to achieve CO2 emission reduction goals including fossil-fueled generating unit heat rate improvements, expansion of renewable energy resources and demand-side energy efficiency measures.  The EPA’s GHG regulations are currently subject to litigation making the final form of the GHG emissions regulations uncertain.  As a result of this uncertainty, strategies to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and we cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts these regulations would have on our operations.  The impacts of these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - We are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Generation, transmission and distribution facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets of physical attacks.  Physical attacks on transmission and distribution facilities that appeared to be terrorist-style attacks have occurred in the recent past.  The risks posed by such attacks could include, among other things, the inability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources, the increased cost of security and insurance, the disruption of, volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, and a decline in the economy within our service territories, all of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the cost of repairing damage to our facilities and infrastructure due to acts of 25Table of Contentsterrorism, and the loss of revenue if such events prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability - We operate in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, such as recently allegedly occurred in Ukraine, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  We have instituted certain safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets.  FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to deter cyber attacks.  The safeguards we have may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber security.  We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.  If the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operation.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers, shareowners and employees.  In some cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks.  For example, we outsource administration of our employee health insurance to Anthem.  Anthem was the target of a cyber attack in 2014.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We may not be able to fully recover costs related to commodity prices - The prices that we may obtain for electric energy may not compensate for changes in delivered coal, natural gas or electric energy spot-market costs, or changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of electric energy.  As a result, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers, especially at WPL where we do not have a retail electric automatic fuel cost adjustment clause, which would allow for more consistent and timely cost recovery.We are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because a large portion of the electricity generated by us is from our coal-fired generating facilities.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply and transportation of coal for most of our generating capability, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Further, we currently rely on coal primarily from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region, including due to bankruptcy of coal mining companies, may cause us to incur additional costs which may not be fully recovered through rates.  Increases in prices and costs due to disruptions that are not fully and timely recovered in rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to changes in the price and availability of natural gas.  In addition to supplying natural gas to our natural gas customers, we also have responsibility to supply natural gas to certain natural gas-fired electric generating facilities that we own.  Our strategic plan includes increasing our reliance on natural-gas fired electric generating facilities, particularly the new facilities planned in Marshalltown, Iowa and Beloit, Wisconsin, and coal-fired facilities expected to switch from coal to natural gas as the primary fuel type.  This increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas, which have remained low recently, but have been volatile in the past.  We have natural gas supply contracts in place, which are generally short-term in duration.  The natural gas supply commitments are either fixed price in nature or market-based.  As some of the contracts are market-based, and some of the contracts are short-term, we may not be able to purchase natural gas with terms and prices as favorable as the current contracts.  Natural gas prices may increase due to disruption of production or transportation of natural gas, failure to drill new wells and reduced supply generally, or regulatory developments that increase the cost of natural gas extraction methods, including fracking.  Price increases may cause us to incur additional costs to purchase natural gas, which may not be fully recovered through rates and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to fully recover higher transmission costs related to changing transmission reliability requirements - Both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system that they do not own or control.  Rates charged to IPL and WPL for such transmission service are regulated by FERC.  FERC also regulates transmission owners’ operations in order to support the reliability of the transmission network.  Changes are occurring in the transmission network, which are necessary to, among other things, accommodate renewable energy and the decommissioning 26Table of Contentsof older coal-fired generating facilities and prepare for potential compliance with future GHG regulations.  These changes include socializing certain transmission network upgrades and system support resource payments, which may increase transmission costs to IPL and WPL.  The prices that IPL and WPL charge for electric energy may not totally compensate for the increase in such transmission costs.  We may not be able to fully pass on the increases in such transmission costs to our customers.  In addition, if the transmission rider at IPL is amended or removed, we may not be able to recover IPL’s full transmission costs.  Inability to fully recover transmission costs in a timely manner may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on the capital markets and could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the capital markets - Successful implementation of our strategic plan and other long-term business strategies is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates.  We have forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $5 billion over the next four years.  Disruption, uncertainty or volatility in those markets could increase our cost of capital or limit the availability of capital.  Disruptions could be caused by Federal Reserve policies and actions, currency concerns, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, a negative view of the utility industry or our company, failures of financial institutions, U.S. debt management concerns, U.S. debt limit and budget debates including government shutdowns, European and worldwide sovereign debt concerns, other global or geopolitical events, or other factors.  Any disruptions could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategic plan.We rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit markets.  If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, we could pay higher interest rates in future financings, the pool of potential lenders could be reduced, borrowing costs under existing credit facilities could increase, our access to the commercial paper market could be limited, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties.  If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses - We are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, and the availability of, and our ability to recruit qualified personnel, which could affect our businesses and our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, the majority of our key personnel are eligible to retire and our workforce includes a significant number of employees who are nearing retirement.  We need employees with specialized and technical skills in order to achieve our strategic plan.  It may be difficult to retain current employees with these specialized skills, especially as they near retirement, and it may be difficult to find new employees with the necessary skills.  We are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with approximately 2,300 employees.  Any work stoppage experienced in connections with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to implement our strategic plan.We face risks associated with operating electric and natural gas infrastructure - The operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, failure of generating facilities including wind turbines, the dependence on a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, employee safety, operator error and compliance with mandatory reliability standards.  The operation of our energy delivery infrastructure involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment and fires developing from our power lines.  In addition, the North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an extensive power outage in our delivery systems.  Increased utilization of customer- and third party-owned generation technologies could disrupt the reliability and balance of the electricity grid.  Further, the transmission system in our utilities’ service territories is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within our service territories.  The transmission constraints could result in an inability to deliver energy from generating facilities, particularly wind generating facilities, to the national grid, or to access lower cost sources of electric energy.  We also have obligations to provide electric service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The operation of our gas transmission and distribution infrastructure also involves many risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and employee safety, which could cause substantial financial losses.  These risks could result in loss of human life, particularly in highly populated areas, significant damage to property, environmental emissions, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  We are also responsible for compliance with new and changing mandatory reliability and safety standards, including anticipated new regulations under the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.  Our infrastructure is aging, which could impact safety and compliance with possible new regulations.  Failure to meet these standards could result in substantial fines.  Electric and gas infrastructure operations could be impacted 27Table of Contentsby future compliance with the Clean Power Plan.  We also have obligations to provide service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments.  Failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We face risks associated with integration of a new customer billing and information system - We recently implemented a new customer billing and information system for IPL and WPL.  This new customer billing and information system houses all customer records, and processes metering, billing and payment transactions.  Integrating a new customer system is complex, costly and time consuming.  If we do not successfully integrate the system and new related processes, or if it does not operate as intended, it could result in substantial disruptions to our business, including customer billings and collections, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Storms or other natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - Storms and other natural disasters, including events such as floods, tornadoes, blizzards, ice storms, droughts, solar flares or pandemics may adversely impact our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources.  We incur costs for preventive measures to replace, reinforce and modernize operating infrastructure that will provide for further grid resiliency.  In addition, we could incur large costs to repair damage to our generating facilities and infrastructure, or costs related to environmental remediation, due to storms or natural disasters.  Severe storms may also impact our natural gas infrastructure.  The restoration costs may not be fully covered by insurance policies.  Some costs may not be recovered in rates, including damaged assets, or there could be significant delays in cost recovery.  Storms and natural disasters may prevent our customers from being able to operate or may significantly slow growth or cause a decline in the economy within our service territories.  The reduced demand for energy could cause lower sales and revenues, which may not be replaced or recovered in rates.  Any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may incur material post-closing adjustments related to past asset and business divestitures - We previously sold certain non-regulated subsidiaries such as RMT, Inc. (RMT) and Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum), as well as regulated assets such as our recent sales of our Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets.  We may continue to incur liabilities relating to our previous ownership of, or the transactions pursuant to which we disposed of, these subsidiaries and assets.  For example, Alliant Energy continues to guarantee RMT’s performance obligations related to certain of RMT’s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy’s sale of RMT.  In addition, Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry, including liabilities with respect to the future abandonment of certain platforms off the coast of California and related onshore plant and equipment owned by the partnerships.  Any potential liability under these guarantees may depend on a number of factors outside of our control, including the financial condition of RMT, Whiting Petroleum and/or their respective assignees.  Any required payments on retained liabilities, guarantees or indemnification obligations with respect to RMT, Whiting Petroleum, the sales of our Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets, or other future asset or business divestitures, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We face risks related to non-regulated operations - We rely on our non-regulated operations for a portion of our earnings.  If our non-regulated investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings.  Failure of our Transportation business to perform as expected could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Franklin County Wind LLC is a non-regulated subsidiary that operates a non-regulated 99 MW wind farm in Franklin County, Iowa, referred to as the Franklin County wind farm.  The Franklin County wind farm’s electrical output is currently being sold into the general market at prevailing market prices.  Additional decreases in forward electricity prices, or if there is reduced expected generation output from the facility if transmission upgrades in the region are not completed or do not result in expected decreased congestion, could trigger an impairment in the future.  Such impairments could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, a variety of operating parameters, including adverse weather conditions, transmission constraints and breakdown or failure of equipment, could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends - Alliant Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own.  Accordingly, the primary sources of funds for Alliant Energy to pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, primarily its utility subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on Alliant Energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries.  Our utilities have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of any outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations applicable to them.  If we do not receive adequate dividends and 28Table of Contentsdistributions from our subsidiaries, then we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on Alliant Energy common stock.Changes to certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations - We have significantly reduced our federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies and the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property.  These tax planning strategies and extensions of bonus depreciation deductions have generated large annual taxable losses and tax credits over the past few years that have resulted in significant federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.  We plan to utilize these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our income tax obligations.  If we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before they expire, we may incur material charges to earnings.  If the IRS does not agree with the deductions resulting from our tax planning strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Our utility business currently operates wind generating facilities, which generate material production tax credits for us to use to reduce our federal tax obligations.  The amount of production tax credits we earn is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by our wind farms and the applicable tax credit rate.  A variety of operating and economic parameters, including significant transmission constraints, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by our wind farms resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have tax benefit riders in place in Iowa that provide billing credits to our customers.  We have made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the tax benefit riders for accounting purposes.  If those assumptions are not accurate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.Lastly, if corporate tax rates or policies are changed with future federal or state legislation, we may be required to take material charges against earnings.Our pension and other postretirement benefits plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact our financial condition - We have pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to many of our employees and retirees.  Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans.  The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics.  Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of our pension plans at various times in the past.  Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements.  Downward pressure on the asset values of our pension plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Energy industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses - We operate in a highly regulated business environment.  The advent of new and unregulated markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.  The evolution of the wholesale and transmission markets has the potential to significantly increase costs of transmission, costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, costs of participation in the new markets and costs stemming from estimated payment settlements.  Competitive pressures, including advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in our utilities losing market share and customers and incurring stranded costs (i.e., assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable through customer rates), which could be borne by our shareowners.  Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of our utility companies.  Increased competition from any restructuring efforts in our primary retail electric service territories may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.ITEM 1B
