    General
     
    Noble
Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, we or us) is a Delaware corporation, formed in
1969, that has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since
1980. We are an independent energy company that has been engaged in the
acquisition, exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil,
natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) since 1932. In this report, unless
otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information
includes that of Noble Energy and its subsidiaries. We operate primarily in the
Rocky Mountains, Mid-continent, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico areas in the US,
with key international operations offshore Israel and West Africa.
     
    Our aim
is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through exploration success and
the finding and development of a high quality portfolio of assets that is
balanced between US and international projects. Exploration success, along with
additional capital investment, in US and international locations such as
Equatorial Guinea and Israel, have resulted in substantial growth in the last
several years. In addition, occasional strategic acquisitions such as Patina Oil
& Gas Corporation (Patina) in 2005 and U.S. Exploration Holdings, Inc.
(U.S. Exploration) in 2006, combined with the sale of non-core assets, have
allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our asset portfolio,
resulting in a company with assets and capabilities that include major US basins
coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. See Item 6.
Selected Financial Data for additional financial and operating information for
fiscal years 2005-2009.
     
    In the
current commodity and economic environment, our focus has remained on
positioning Noble Energy for the future. In January 2009, we announced a
significant discovery at Tamar, offshore Israel, the largest discovery in our
history. Also during 2009, we made substantial progress on our significant
portfolio of long-term growth projects, including the sanctioning of the oil
development projects at Aseng (formerly Benita) offshore Equatorial Guinea and
at Isabela/Santa Cruz (which we refer to collectively as Galapagos) in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as making important progress on our plans for
the Tamar discovery.  These and other major development projects
typically offer long life, sustained cash flows after investment and attractive
financial returns. We also have significant remaining exploration potential,
primarily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa and
Israel.
     
    Major
Development Project Inventory   Our exploration success
has provided us with a number of significant development projects on which we
are moving forward. These projects will require significant capital investments
over the next several years.  Our major projects include the

Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil
equivalent.
     
    In
December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it
had approved revisions to modernize its oil and gas company reserves reporting
requirements. We adopted the new rules as of December 31, 2009.  See
Proved Reserves Disclosures, below, for additional disclosures provided in
accordance with the SEC’s rules for Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting and
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas
Information (Unaudited) for definitions of proved oil and gas reserves, proved
developed oil and gas reserves and proved undeveloped oil and gas
reserves.
    
    Crude
Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities
     
    We search
for crude oil and natural gas properties, seek to acquire exploration rights in
areas of interest and conduct exploratory activities. These activities include
geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where
appropriate, on properties for which we have acquired exploration rights. Our
properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil
and natural gas leases and concessions. We also own natural gas processing
plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas related
pipeline systems which are primarily used in the processing and transportation
of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production.
     
    Exploration
Activities   We primarily focus on organic growth from
exploration and development drilling, concentrating on basins or plays where we
have strategic competitive advantage and which we believe offer superior
returns. We have had substantial exploration success in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean resulting in a significant
portfolio of major development projects. We have a numerous exploration
opportunities remaining in these areas and are engaged in new venture activity
in other international locations as well.
     
    
      Appraisal,
Development and Exploitation Activities   We assess our
exploration successes for potential development as demonstrated in our growing
inventory of major projects.  In 2009, we sanctioned the Isabela and
Aseng projects and are progressing toward sanctioning the Tamar, Belinda and
Gunflint projects during 2010 and/or 2011.We support a significant portion of
the capital needs of these major projects with our long-lived inventory of
low-risk development and exploitation projects.  Low-risk development
and exploitation projects, such as the Wattenberg field in our North America
operations, also provide diversification and balance to our worldwide
portfolio.
       
    
    Acquisition and Divestiture
Activities     We
maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program. Accordingly, we may engage
in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related
assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of
entities owning the assets. We may also divest non-core assets in order to
optimize our property portfolio.
     
    
      Pending Asset
Acquisition In January 2010, we
announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
substantially all of the US Rocky Mountain assets of Petro-Canada Resources
(USA) Inc. and Suncor Energy (Natural Gas) America Inc. for $494 million. We
estimate total proved reserves to be 53 MMBoe, 45% of which are liquids and 80%
are within the liquid-rich Wattenberg field, where our largest onshore US asset
is located. The acquisition will add approximately 10 MBoepd, or 46 MMcf of
natural gas and 2.5 MBbls of liquids to our daily production base, starting from
the closing date, for 2010 and will provide significant growth potential.
Included in the purchase are 340,000 total net acres, nearly 200,000 of which
are located in the Greater Denver-Julesberg (DJ) Basin. The acquisition is
expected to close late in the first quarter 2010 and is subject to customary

      Mid-continent
Acquisition   In 2008, we acquired producing properties in
western Oklahoma for $292 million. Properties acquired cover approximately
15,500 net acres. The total purchase price was allocated to the proved and
unproved properties acquired based on fair values at the acquisition date.
Approximately $254 million was allocated to proved properties and $38 million to
unproved properties.
       
    
    Sale of Argentina
Assets   In 2008, we closed on the sale of our producing
property interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective
July 1, 2007. The $24 million gain on sale was deferred until 2009 when approval
was obtained from the Argentine government. Our crude oil reserves for Argentina
totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007.
     
    Sale of Gulf of Mexico Shelf
Properties  In 2006, we sold all of
our significant Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area,
which required repairs related to hurricane damage at the time. As of the
effective date of the sale, proved reserves for the Gulf of Mexico properties
sold totaled approximately 7 MMBbls of crude oil and 110 Bcf of natural gas. The
deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a core area and is more aligned with our
long-term business strategies.
     
    U.S. Exploration Acquisition
  In 2006, we acquired U.S.
Exploration, a privately held corporation, for $412 million plus
liabilities assumed. U.S. Exploration’s reserves and production were located
primarily in Colorado’s Wattenberg field. This acquisition significantly
expanded our operations in one of our core areas. Proved reserves of U.S.
Exploration at the time of acquisition were approximately 234 Bcfe, of which 38%
were proved developed and 55% natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas
properties were valued at $413 million and unproved properties were valued
at $131 million. In addition, we recorded $34 million of
goodwill. 
     
    Patina Merger  In 2005, we acquired
Patina through merger (Patina Merger) for a total purchase price of
$4.9 billion. Patina’s long-lived crude oil and natural gas reserves
provided a significant inventory of low-risk opportunities that balanced our
portfolio. Patina’s proved reserves at the time of acquisition were estimated to
be approximately 1.6 Tcfe, of which 72% were proved developed and 67% natural
gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at
$2.6 billion and unproved properties were valued at $1.1 billion. In
addition, we recorded $875 million of goodwill.

    We have
been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and
development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of
Mexico since 1968. The Patina Merger and the acquisition of U.S. Exploration
significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations, especially in the
Rocky Mountains and Mid-continent areas. These two acquisitions, along with
other acquisitions of producing and non-producing properties, have provided us
with a multi-year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. We
expect to close on a purchase of additional US Rocky Mountain assets in first
quarter 2010, which will further increase our operations and project inventory
in this area. In 2009, we were awarded 22 new leases in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico.
     
    US
operations accounted for 56% of our 2009 consolidated sales volumes and 56% of
total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. Approximately 55% of the proved
reserves are natural gas and 45% are crude oil, condensate and NGLs. Our onshore
US portfolio at December 31, 2009 included 956,000 net developed acres and
1.3 million net undeveloped acres. We currently hold interests in 103 offshore
blocks in the Gulf of Mexico.

    Locations
of our US onshore operations in the Wattenberg field, Mid-continent area and
other significant areas are shown on the map below:
    
     
    
     
    Northern Region The Northern
region consists of our operations in the Rocky Mountain area, which includes the
DJ (Wattenberg field), Piceance, San Juan, and Wind River basins, as well as the
Niobrara (Tri-State) and Bowdoin fields. The Rocky Mountain area is one of our
core operating assets. The Northern region also includes the Mid-continent area,
consisting of properties in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and
Kansas.
     
    Wattenberg
Field   The Wattenberg field (approximately 96% operated
working interest), located in the DJ basin of north central Colorado, is our
largest onshore US field and continues to grow. We acquired working interests in
the Wattenberg field through the Patina Merger in 2005 and acquisition of U.S.
Exploration in 2006. The Wattenberg field held 57% of our US proved reserves at
December 31, 2009.
     
    One of
the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive
formations, which include the Codell, Niobrara, and J-Sand formations, as well
as the D-Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman formations.
Drilling in the Wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective
of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves.

          Table of Contents
        
      
    
    
    Our
current field activities are focused primarily on the improved recovery of
reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores,
recompleting the Codell formation within existing J-Sand wells, refracturing or
trifracturing existing Codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the
Niobrara formation within existing Codell wells. A refracture consists of the
restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance
production and add incremental reserves. A trifracture is effectively a
refracture of a refracture. These projects and continued success with our
production enhancement program, which includes well workovers, reactivations,
and commingling of zones, allow us to increase production and add proved
reserves to what is considered a mature field.
     
    Due to
economic conditions, our 2009 program decreased from 2008 levels. In 2009, we
drilled or participated in 424 gross Wattenberg field development wells, with a
100% success rate. Three of these wells were horizontal wells targeting the
Niobrara formation. We added approximately 36 MMBoe of proved reserves,
approximately 49% of which were natural gas.  At year-end, we were
running five drilling rigs and 17 completion units in the field.
     
    We have
experienced significant growth in production from the Wattenberg field, from an
average of 33 MBoepd at year-end 2005 to approximately 45 MBoepd for fourth
quarter 2009. Expansion of field boundaries has resulted in a large increase in
our crude oil and NGL stream since year-end 2005. As a result, year-end 2009
production included approximately 20 MBpd of liquids. Sales of Wattenberg field
production accounted for 41% of total US sales volumes in 2009.
     
    The
infrastructure in this area is improving and expanding. Oil transport
alternatives improved in 2009 with the start up of a new interstate crude oil
transportation pipeline system running from Weld County, Colorado, where the
Wattenberg field is located, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The pipeline, in which we own
a small equity interest, provides another option for the marketing of our crude
oil. We have a five-year throughput agreement with the pipeline.
     
    We
continue to acquire acreage in the area and held interests in approximately
350,000 net acres at year-end 2009. We are planning an active capital program in
2010 and expect to increase the program from 2009 levels, drilling approximately
500 wells, with continued focus on new wells in the Codell/Niobrara formations.
We will have the flexibility with short-term drilling rig contracts to decrease
activity if economic conditions decline. Additionally, we have a substantial
project inventory remaining and plan to continue steady refracture, trifracture,
and recompletion programs in 2010.
     
    
      As
discussed under Acquisition and Divestiture Activities – Pending Asset
Acquisition above, we expect to close on an acquisition of additional US Rocky
Mountain assets late in the first quarter 2010. We have identified several
thousand projects associated with the assets being acquired, including over
2,000 Codell/Niobrara drilling locations in Wattenberg. We plan to add two rigs
to our Wattenberg program in 2010 as a result of the transaction. We expect this
activity to grow net production, with a focus on increasing liquids
contribution.
       
      
    
    Mid-continent
Area   The Mid-continent area includes properties in the
Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and Kansas. Significant areas of activity have been in
the Cleveland Sandstone area of western Oklahoma (89% operated working
interest). We drilled or participated in 31 development wells in 2009, 97% of
which were successful.
     
    In 2009,
we continued drilling in the Cleveland Sandstone formation in western Oklahoma,
on acreage we acquired in 2008. Cleveland Sandstone is a tight gas play
characterized by low-permeability rock. We drilled 20 wells (included in the
count above) using horizontal drilling techniques, all of which were successful,
and recent wells have come on line with greater than 40% liquids
production. We
currently have one rig operating and expect to drill approximately the same
number of wells in 2010 as we drilled in 2009.
     
    Other Northern
Region   Other Northern region areas of activity are as
follows:
     
    Piceance
Basin – The Piceance basin in
western Colorado (approximately 89% operated working interest) is a major North
America natural gas basin and is characterized by low-porosity rock. The primary
productive formation is the Mesaverde Williams Fork
formation.  Multiple wells are drilled from individual drilling pads
to reduce rig mobilization costs in mountainous terrain and to minimize
environmental impact on the surface area.  Well spacing is
approximately ten acres per well.
     
    As in the
Wattenberg field, Piceance basin drilling time per well has been reduced due to
our increased use of improved drilling technology. In the Piceance basin, we are
using new fit-for-purpose rigs which include design innovations and technology
improvements that capture incremental time savings during all phases of the well
drilling process, including moving between wells. Fit-for-purpose rigs can drill
multiple wells from one location and are particularly useful in developing
hydrocarbon reserves in tight-gas areas such as the Piceance basin.
     
    In 2009,
we drilled or participated in 48 development wells and one exploratory well,
100% of which were successful. Successful drilling activity in recent years has
led to significant volume growth; production has grown from 2 MMcfepd in 2005 to
54 MMcfepd for fourth quarter 2009.
     
    We have
assembled a significant acreage position in the Piceance basin and currently
hold interests in approximately 20,000 net acres providing a large inventory of
future projects. At this time, we plan to operate a single-rig drilling program
in 2010.
     
    Tri-State Area
(Niobrara) – Our
operations in the Tri-State area (eastern Colorado, extending into Kansas and
Nebraska) center primarily around the development of the Niobrara Trend
(approximately 96% operated working interest). The Niobrara formation is an
important shallow natural gas producer. Since 2006, we have expanded our
acreage position
to over 580,000 net acres.  We have a substantial future project
inventory, including Niobrara infill and exploitation drilling along with
gathering system and compressor station additions to develop reserves and
deliver new production.  In 2009, we drilled or participated in 64
development wells, 100% of which were successful, and we plan to continue our
Niobrara drilling program in 2010.

      Wind
River Basin –  At Iron
Horse in the Wind River Basin (88% operated working interest) located in central
Wyoming, we drilled 18 development wells during 2009 with a 94% success
rate.  We plan to continue our drilling program here during 2010 and
expect to drill approximately 20 new wells.
       
      Bowdoin
and San Juan – We are also active in
the Bowdoin field (approximately 63% operated working interest), located in
north central Montana and the San Juan basin (approximately 82% operated working
interest), located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. In
2009, activity was reduced in these areas as we focused most of our capital
spending on the core development fields of Wattenberg, Piceance and western
Oklahoma. We drilled or participated in a total of 13 development wells in the
Bowdoin field and San Juan basin, 100% of which were successful, and one
unsuccessful exploratory well.
       
      Southern Region The Southern region
includes the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore areas primarily in Texas and
Louisiana.
       
      Deepwater Gulf of
Mexico   The deepwater Gulf of Mexico is one of our core
areas and accounted for 19% of 2009 US sales volumes and 7% of US proved
reserves at December 31, 2009. We currently hold leases on 103 deepwater Gulf of
Mexico blocks, representing approximately 390,000 net acres. We operate
approximately 86% of the leases. Locations of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico
developments are shown on the map below:
       
       
      
       
       
      We
continue to expand our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations primarily through an
active exploration program, expansion of our 3-D seismic database, and lease
acquisition. Our exploration activities have led to discoveries at Gunflint, a
2008 discovery which is our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery to date;
Isabela; Redrock/Raton; and, most recently, Santa Cruz.
       
      During
2009, we moved forward with development plans for some of our recent
discoveries, as discussed below, and continued our exploratory program. We
participated in Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 208 and were awarded 22 new
deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks which will complement our growing inventory of
exploration opportunities. We currently have an inventory of over 30 identified
prospects, with a combination of both large stand-alone prospects as well as a
number of smaller, tie-back opportunities.
       
      Our
exploration efforts continued during December 2009 as drilling began on two
significant test wells at the Deep Blue prospect (Green Canyon Block 723; 33.75%
operated working interest) and one at the Double Mountain prospect (Green Canyon
Block 556; 30% non-operated working interest).

      Our most
significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties and current development plans
are discussed in more detail below:
       
      Gunflint (Mississippi Canyon Block 948; 37.5%
operated working interest and Mississippi Canyon Block 949; 43.75% operated
working interest)   We announced the Gunflint crude oil
discovery, our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery to date, in October
2008. We have acquired additional seismic information and are preparing to drill
one or two appraisal wells in 2010. We are the operator of the
development.
       
      Galapagos Development Project
including Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562, 33% non-operated working
interest) and Santa Cruz (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519/563, 23.25% operated
working interest)  During third quarter 2009, we approved the
Galapagos development project, which consists of our 2007 discovery, Isabela,
and our 2009 discovery on adjacent acreage, Santa Cruz. The phased development
plan includes completion of the Isabela and Santa Cruz wells during second and
third quarter 2010, and then connecting them to nearby infrastructure via
subsea tiebacks.   Initial production is expected in
2011.  During the first half of 2010, we also plan to drill the
Santiago exploration well (23.25% operated working interest) which is a separate
prospect in the same offshore block as Santa Cruz.  If the Santiago
well is successful, it will be completed in 2010, with production expected in
2011.
       
      Redrock/Raton (Mississippi Canyon
Blocks 204, 248 and 292; 66.67 % working
interest)   Redrock was a 2006 natural gas/condensate
discovery and Raton was a 2006 natural gas discovery. The South Raton appraisal
well was also drilled in 2006.  In 2007, we successfully sidetracked
and completed the Raton discovery well and it was tied back and came on
production in late 2008. In 2008, we drilled a successful sidetrack-appraisal
well at South Raton and we currently expect it to be tied back to a host
facility. Redrock is currently considered a co-development candidate to the
completed sidetrack well at South Raton. We are the operator of
Redrock/Raton.
       
      Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Blocks 917,
961 and 962; 85% working interest)   Swordfish was a 2001
discovery and began producing in 2005. During 2009, a Swordfish gas well watered
out. We sidetracked the well into an oil zone, and production began in January,
2010. The Swordfish project currently includes three producing wells connected
to a third-party production facility through subea tiebacks. We are the operator
of Swordfish.
       
      Ticonderoga (Green Canyon block 768;
50% working interest)   Ticonderoga is a non-operated 2004
crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes
three producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea
tiebacks. In September 2008, Ticonderoga was shut-in as a result of hurricane
damage to third-party processing and pipeline facilities. It remained shut-in
until August 2009 when it was returned to full production.
       
      Onshore East Texas and North
Louisiana   This is an emerging area for us. Recent
acquisitions have increased our leasehold acreage to approximately 17,000 gross
acres. Our 2009 drilling program targeted the Haynesville shale (approximately
60% working interest), and we completed our first horizontal East Texas
Haynesville shale well with an initial thirty-day average production rate of
over 11 MMcfpd, gross. We drilled a second exploration well in fourth quarter
2009 that was completed in late January 2010 and is being tested. We plan to
drill approximately 10 to 11 Haynesville wells on our operated acreage in 2010
and participate in another seven to eight Haynesville wells operated by
others.
       
      International
       
      International
operations are significant to our business, accounting for 44% of consolidated
sales volumes in 2009 and 44% of total proved reserves at December 31,
2009. International proved reserves are approximately 64% natural gas and 36%
crude oil. Operations in Equatorial Guinea, Ecuador, China and Suriname are
conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. In
Cameroon, we operate in accordance with the terms of a production sharing
contract and a mining concession. Operations in the North Sea, Israel and other
foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements or
licenses.

      Locations
of our major international operations are shown on the map below:
       
      
      
      West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and
Cameroon)   West Africa is one of our core operating areas.
Crude oil and natural gas sales volumes accounted for 61% of 2009 consolidated
international sales volumes and 70% of international proved reserves at
December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we held approximately 53,000
net developed acres and 212,000 net undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea and
563,000 net undeveloped acres in Cameroon.

      Alba
Field   We began investing in West Africa in the early
1990’s. Activities center around our 34% non-operated working interest in the
Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which is one of our most significant
assets. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate
facilities, a methanol plant, and an onshore LPG processing plant (both located
on Bioko Island) where additional condensate is produced. The methanol plant is
capable of producing up to 3,000 MTpd gross.
       
      We sell
our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the
methanol plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba
Plant LLC (Alba Plant), in which we have a 28% interest accounted for by the
equity method. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production
Company, LLC (AMPCO), in which we have a 45% interest accounted for by the
equity method. The methanol plant purchases natural gas from the Alba field
under a contract that runs through 2026. AMPCO subsequently markets the produced
methanol to customers in the US and Europe. Alba Plant sells its LPG products
and condensate at our marine terminal at prevailing market prices. We sell our
share of condensate produced in the Alba field and from the LPG plant under
short-term contracts at market-based prices.
       
      Blocks O and I, YoYo and
Tilapia    During the past several
years, we have conducted a successful
exploration and appraisal drilling program in the Douala basin in West Africa,
centering around Blocks O and I, offshore Equatorial Guinea, and the YoYo mining
concession and Tilapia production sharing contract offshore Cameroon, where we
have an interest in over 1.1 million gross acres. We are the operator in
Cameroon (50% working interest) and the technical operator on Block O (45%
working interest) and Block I (40% working interest).
       
      Our first
discovery occurred in October 2005, when we announced successful test
results from the O-1 (Belinda) exploration well offshore Equatorial Guinea. In
2007, we drilled seven wells, resulting in three new discoveries and three
successful appraisal wells. In 2008, we announced successful results from the
I-5 Benita oil appraisal well on Block I; the Felicita,
a condensate and natural gas discovery on Block O; and the Diega, a gas
condensate and oil discovery on Block I.  In February 2009, we
announced a successful oil discovery on Block O at the Carmen
prospect.
       
      In
December 2008, we submitted a Plan of Development for the Aseng field (formerly
known as Benita) to the government of Equatorial Guinea. On July 22, 2009, we
announced that it had been sanctioned by us, our partners, and the Ministry of
Mines, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Equatorial
Guinea.  
       
      Initial
development of the Aseng field will include multiple subsea wells flowing to a
floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) where the production
stream will be separated.  The oil will be stored on the FPSO until
sold, while the natural gas and water will be reinjected into the reservoir to
maintain pressure and maximize oil recoveries. The FPSO is designed with
capacity to process 120 MBpd of liquids, including 80 MBpd of oil. In addition,
the vessel will be capable of reinjecting 170 MMcfpd of natural gas. Storage on
the vessel will be approximately 1.6 MMBbls of liquids. The vessel is designed
to act as an oil production hub, and as a liquids storage and offloading hub
with capabilities to support future subsea oil field developments, and
capabilities to take on board, independently from the production train,
stabilized condensate from gas condensate fields in the area. First production
from the Aseng field is estimated to commence by mid-year 2012 at 50 MBpd of oil
gross (16.5 MBpd net). The FPSO and subsea equipment contracts were awarded in
2009, and construction activities have begun on the FPSO. We have two rigs
contracted to assist in field development. Drilling and completion activities
have commenced. 
       
      We have
evaluated the potential for additional liquids and gas projects, and expect that
the next development will be at the Belinda field. We are engaged in geologic
and reservoir FEED (front end engineering design) work at Belinda, targeting
liquid production from this gas condensate field.  We currently
anticipate drilling subsea wells which will be tied to a production facility
that would remove liquids and reinject gas for future use pending further
development at Belinda.  The liquids would be transported to the FPSO
at Aseng for storage and sales.  Belinda project sanction is currently
scheduled to occur in 2010 with production beginning in 2013. We are also
evaluating future oil projects at Diega and Carmen and currently scheduling
first production for 2014.
       
      In 2010,
we expect to resume exploration activities offshore Equatorial Guinea and
acquire a 3-D seismic survey over YoYo and portions of Tilapia in
Cameroon.
       
      Eastern Mediterranean (Israel
and
Cyprus)   Another core operating area is located offshore
Israel. Natural gas sales volumes in Israel accounted for 21% of 2009
consolidated international sales volumes and natural gas reserves accounted for
11% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2009. At
December 31, 2009, we held approximately 29,000 net developed acres
and 796,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 90 miles offshore
Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 6,500 feet. Our leasehold
position in Israel includes four leases and 17 licenses.  We are the
operator of the properties. We also hold a license covering approximately
795,000 net undeveloped acres offshore Cyprus.
       
      Mari-B
Field    We have been operating in the Mediterranean
Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998, and the Mari-B field (47% working interest) is
one of our core international assets. The Mari-B field is the first offshore
natural gas production facility in Israel and currently has a peak
deliverability of approximately 500 MMcfpd from five wells. In 2008, we
commissioned a permanent onshore receiving terminal in Ashdod for distribution
of natural gas from the Mari-B field to purchasers. During 2009, we moved
forward on a compression project that we expect will recover additional reserves
and extend the field’s peak deliverability. We also began mobilizing equipment
to drill two development wells
planned in the first half of 2010. Together with the completion of the
compression work, these new wells will provide substantial, additional near-term
gas deliverability and serve as injection wells for natural gas storage in the
future.

      Natural
gas sales began in 2004 and have increased steadily as Israel’s natural gas
infrastructure has developed. Average sales volumes have risen from 48 MMcfpd in
2004 to a record high of 139 MMcfpd in 2008 and were 114 MMcfpd in 2009. The
natural gas market in Israel continues to be robust. The Israel Electric
Corporation Limited (IEC), our largest purchaser, has continued to convert power
plants to use natural gas as fuel. In 2009, the IEC power plant at Hagit began
consuming natural gas purchased from us and in December 2009 we initiated
natural gas sales to a new customer, Israel Chemicals Ltd.
       
      
        During
third quarter 2009, we signed a new natural gas sales contract with our primary
customer, IEC, under the terms of which they will purchase the
majority of our remaining undedicated Mari-B field gas at prices expected
to be significantly higher than what we have been receiving under the original
contract. The actual price received is tied to a blend of liquids prices and a
producer price index.  In addition, it was agreed that all sales from the
Mari-B field going forward will be proportionately allocated between the two
contracts regardless of the total volume sold.  This is a major change
from the past arrangement wherein only “excess” volumes above a threshold level
received premium prices. In addition, we have signed a letter of intent (LOI)
with IEC, under which IEC expects to purchase natural gas to establish a
strategic inventory reserve at Mari-B. The Mari-B partners would provide IEC
with injection, storage and withdrawal capabilities for this inventory under a
related service agreement.
         
      
      Competing
imports of natural gas from Egypt to Israel began in 2008. However, there is
still opportunity for significant new sales in the future as the Israeli
infrastructure and markets continue to expand.
       
      Tamar and
Dalit   During 2009, our exploratory program resulted in
two significant discoveries. In January 2009, we announced a very significant
natural gas discovery at the Tamar-1 well at the Tamar prospect (36% working
interest), offshore northern Israel, and in February 2009, we announced a
successful test of production flow rates at the location. Then in March 2009, we
announced another natural gas discovery at the Dalit prospect (36% working
interest) followed by a successful well test in April 2009.
       
      We then
drilled a Tamar appraisal well (Tamar-2), the results of which increased our
estimate of the size of the reservoir and confirmed its high quality and extent.
Tamar is the largest discovery in our history.
       
      
        We are
moving forward with Tamar development plans, and expect project sanction and
recording of proved reserves in the first half of 2010, with first
production projected for 2012.  
         
        In fourth quarter 2009, we
signed an LOI to sell natural gas from the Tamar field to Dalia Power Energies
(Dalia). Dalia, a privately-owned electricity company, has a license to build a
natural gas-fired power plant in Israel with operations planned to commence in
2013. According to terms of the LOI, we and our partners will deliver natural
gas volumes of approximately 200 Bcf to Dalia under a 17-year supply agreement.
Sales volumes under the LOI may be increased to 700 Bcf depending upon the final
size of the power plant and extent of operations. We also signed an LOI
to sell natural gas from the Tamar field to IEC. IEC expects to purchase at
least 95 Bcf of natural gas per year with the potential to procure significantly
higher quantities for a period of 15 years beginning at the startup of
Tamar.
         
      
      We
continue to remain focused on the vast exploration potential remaining offshore
Israel. The successes at Tamar and Dalit opened up a substantial new natural gas
basin, the Levantine.  A 3-D seismic program is underway to collect
additional data over several leads on our acreage in the Levantine. Based on
results from the seismic program, we are planning to drill an exploratory well
in the area in the second half of 2010.
       
      Other
       
      North Sea   We
have been conducting business in the North Sea (the Netherlands and the UK)
since 1996 and currently have working interests in 18 licenses with working
interests ranging from 7% to 40%. We are the operator of one
block.  The North Sea accounted for 8% of 2009 consolidated
international sales volumes and 7% of international proved reserves at
December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we held approximately
6,000 net developed acres and 44,000 net undeveloped acres.
       
      Most of
our production is from the non-operated Dumbarton field (30% working interest)
in blocks 15/20a and 15/20b in the UK sector of the North Sea. We also produce
from the MacCulloch, Hanze, Cook and other fields.
       
      The
Dumbarton development, which began production in 2007, includes a subsea
tie-back to the GP III, an FPSO in which we own a 30% interest. Additional
development (30% working interest) began in 2008, and two new wells were brought
on line.  During 2009, our field optimization work
continued.  Dumbarton now has eight horizontal producers and two water
injection wells.
       
      The
Dumbarton field experienced a controlled shut-down in August 2009, due to a
malfunctioning swivel on the FPSO. Production was deferred for essentially all
of September and October.
       
      We also
participated in the development of the nearby Lochranza discovery in block
15/20a (30% working interest). During 2009, the first Lochranza horizontal well
was completed and tied back to Dumbarton’s subsea facilities. Production began
in fourth quarter 2009.  We expect a second horizontal well to be
completed and come on line in the first quarter of 2010.

      We have
also participated in the Flyndre project (22.5% working interest) and Selkirk
project (30.5% working interest), both located in the UK sector of the North
Sea. At Flyndre, we successfully completed an exploratory appraisal well in
2007.  We are currently working with the project operator and other
partners to finalize the field development plan and relevant operating
agreements. At Selkirk, we participated in the drilling of an appraisal well
which was sidetracked to the original discovery well location, to ensure
presence of effective reservoir, and suspended as a future producer. We are
currently working with our partners on development options.
       
      
        In 2009,
we conducted a market test of our wholly-owned subsidiary Noble Energy (Europe)
Limited, which holds our interests in the Netherlands and the UK, and received
bids. However, we have not committed to a plan to sell these
assets.
         
        Ecuador   Operations
in Ecuador accounted for 5% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and
8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2009. The concession
covers approximately 12,000 net developed acres and 849,000 net undeveloped
acres.
      
       
      We have
been operating in Ecuador since 1996. We utilize natural gas from the Amistad
field (in shallow water offshore Ecuador) to generate electricity through a
100%-owned natural gas-fired power plant, located near the city of Machala. The
Machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator
with a capacity of 130 MW from twin turbines. It is the only natural gas-fired
commercial power generator in Ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost
producers of thermal power in the country. The Machala power plant connects to
the Amistad field via a 40-mile pipeline. In 2009, power generation totaled 902
GW hours.

      China     We have been engaged in
exploration and development activities in China since 1996, with production
beginning in 2003. We have a 57% working interest in the Cheng Dao Xi (CDX)
field, which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay. During
fourth quarter 2009, we drilled one horizontal well from our existing platform
at the CDX field and commenced drilling a second well.  The rig will
initiate a program to pre-drill a number of production and injection wells
designed to be connected to a second platform at the field.  This is
part of the ongoing expansion project with plans to install the second platform
and connect the additional wells in late 2010. China accounted for 5% of 2009
consolidated international sales volumes and 4% of international proved reserves
at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we held approximately
4,000 net developed acres and no undeveloped acres.
       
      Additional International
Locations   We hold approximately four million net
undeveloped acres in other international locations including Suriname,
Nicaragua, and India.

    extraction.
              
            
      
       
      We
adopted the rules effective December 31, 2009.
       
      Effect
of Adoption    Application of the new reserve rules
resulted in the use of lower prices at December 31, 2009 for both oil and gas
than would have resulted under the previous rules. Use of new 12-month average
pricing rules at December 31, 2009 resulted in a decrease in proved reserves of
approximately 27 MMBoe. Use of the old year-end prices rules would have resulted
in an increase in proved reserves of approximately 34 MMBoe at December 31,
2009. Therefore, the total impact of the new price methodology rules
resulted in negative reserves revisions of 61 MMBoe. In
addition to the new pricing methodology rules, the new proved undeveloped
reserves rules, which limit PUDs to those scheduled to be drilled within the
next five years, resulted in an additional reduction of proved reserves of
approximately 18 MMBoe.

      Internal Controls Over Reserves
Estimates  
Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves
estimates requires reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
guidance and prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum
engineering principles. Responsibility for compliance in reserves bookings is
delegated to our Corporate Reservoir Engineering group and requires that
reserves estimates be made by the regional reservoir engineering staff and
reviewed by the regional reservoir engineering supervisor.
       
      Qualified
petroleum engineers in our Houston, Denver and London offices prepare all
reserves estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserves
estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior
engineering staff with final approval by the Vice President - Strategic
Planning, Environmental Analysis & Reserves (Vice President – Reserves) and
certain members of senior management.
       
      Our Vice
President – Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for
overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Vice President –
Reserves has a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and over 20 years of
industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering
and evaluations. The Vice President – Reserves reports directly to our Chief
Executive Officer.
       
      We engage
a third-party petroleum consulting firm to audit a significant portion of our
reserves.  See Third-Party Reserves Audit below.
       
      Technologies Used in Reserves
Estimation   The SEC’s new rules expanded the technologies
that a company can use to establish reserves. The SEC now allows use of
techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in
the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable
technology that establishes reasonable certainty.  Reliable technology
is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that
has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain
results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or
in an analogous formation.
       
      We used a
combination of production and pressure performance, wireline wellbore
measurements, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and
interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to
calculate our reserves estimates, including the material additions to the 2009
reserves estimates.
       
      Third-Party Reserves
Audit   In each of
the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we retained Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. (NSAI), independent, third-party reserves engineers, to
perform reserves audits of proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2009 included
a detailed review of 20 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
US onshore fields, which covered approximately 78% of US proved reserves and 96%
of international proved reserves (86% of total proved reserves). The reserves
audit for 2008 included a detailed review of 18 of our major fields and covered
approximately 86% of total proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2007 included
a detailed review of 16 of our major fields and covered approximately 81% of
total proved reserves.
       
      In
connection with the 2009 reserves audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our
proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI
examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities, future producing
rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue.
NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization, using
the definitions for proved reserves set forth in the recently updated Regulation
S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and
guidance. In the conduct of the reserves audit, NSAI did not independently
verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us
with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data,
historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements
relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production.
However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of
NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such
information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had
satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently
verified such information or data. NSAI determined that our estimates of
reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of
“reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability
of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions,
consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(2) of Regulation S-X.
NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at
December 31, 2009, based upon its evaluation. The NSAI opinion concluded
that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering
and evaluation principles. NSAI’s report is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
       
      The
fields audited by NSAI are chosen in accordance with company guidelines and
result in the audit of a minimum of 80% of our total proved reserves. The fields
are chosen by the Vice President – Reserves and are reviewed by senior
management and the Board of Directors.  When compared on a
field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go
into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external
estimates are to be expected. On a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates
ranged from one MMBoe above to 16 MMBoe below as compared with our estimates. On
a percentage basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 9% above our estimates
to 20% below our estimates. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI
are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate
variance is greater than 10%. Reserves differences at December 31,
2009 were, in the aggregate, approximately 21 MMBoe, or 3%.

      Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)
  As of December 31, 2009, our PUDs totaled 142 MMBbls of crude
oil and 769 Bcf of natural gas, for a total of 270 MMBoe.
       
      PUD
Locations     Approximately 70% of our PUDs at
year-end 2009 were associated with our major development areas in the Wattenberg
field (onshore US) and the Alba field (offshore Equatorial Guinea). An
additional 17% of PUDs at year-end 2009 were associated with major development
projects at the Aseng field (offshore Equatorial Guinea) and the Galapagos
project (deepwater Gulf of Mexico). All of these projects will have PUDs convert
from undeveloped to developed as these projects begin production and/or
production facilities are expanded or upgraded.

      The
majority of the reserves reclassified from proved reserves to probable reserves
were associated with the Wattenberg field, where we maintain an extensive
multi-year development program.
       
      Development
Costs    Costs incurred relating
to the development of PUDs were approximately $440 million in 2009, $528
million in 2008 and $390 million in 2007.
       
      Estimated
future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be
approximately $900 million in 2010, $800 million in 2011, and $500 million in
2012.
       
      Drilling
Plans      All PUD drilling locations are
scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2014.  PUDs associated
with projects other than drilling (such as compression projects) are also
expected to be converted to proved developed reserves prior to the end of
2014.  Initial production from these PUDs is expected to begin between
2010 to 2015.
       
      We have 7
MMBoe of PUDs associated with an international discovery that has been booked
for longer than five years.  Development planning is proceeding on
this project, and drilling is expected to begin in the next two
years.  The only other PUDs that have been booked for longer than five
years are associated with compression projects.  In those cases, the
reserves are expected to be recovered from existing wells.

      Natural gas is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol
      plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. Sales to these plants are based on a
      BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. The
      methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for
      under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG
      plant are included in the crude oil
information.

      Revenues
from sales of crude oil and natural gas have accounted for 90% or more of
consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years.
       
      At
December 31, 2009, our operated properties accounted for approximately 60%
of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability
to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also
enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital
expenditures.

      Productive
wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. A gross
well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells
is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. The number of
net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells
expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Wells with multiple
completions are counted as one well in the table above.

      A
productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a
dry well. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or extension well
that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient
quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
       
      As
defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, an exploratory well is a well
drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously
found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. A development well is
part of a development project, which is defined as the means by which petroleum
resources are brought to the status of economically producible. The number of
wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the
respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to
the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the
case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has
been abandoned.
       
      In
addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2009 included in the table above,
at December 31, 2009, we were in the process of drilling or completing 152
gross (113.2 net) wells in the Northern region of our US operations, two gross
(0.7 net) onshore wells in the Southern region of our US operations, two gross
(0.6 net) wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one gross (0.3 net) well in the
North Sea, and one gross (0.6 net) well in China.
       
      Marketing Activities We seek opportunities to
enhance the value of our US natural gas production by marketing directly to
end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and
pipelines. We sell our natural gas production at both market-based and fixed
prices. In 2009, approximately 28% of natural gas sales were made pursuant to
long-term contracts under either fixed or market-based prices.
       
      Crude
oil, condensate and NGLs produced in the US and foreign locations are generally
sold under short-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and
quality. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market under a long-term
contract at market-based prices. In Israel, we sell natural gas under long-term
contracts at negotiated prices. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through
pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and
refineries.

      Delivery
Commitments   Some of our natural gas sales contracts
specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity of product. We have
commitments to deliver approximately 220 Bcf of natural gas, net to our
interest, to various customers in Israel through the year 2022. Approximately
90% of this amount will be delivered by 2015. We expect to fulfill the delivery
commitments with
proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves from the Mari-B and other
nearby fields in Israel and we do not expect any shortfall. See
International – Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus).
       
      Significant Purchaser Glencore Energy UK Ltd
(Glencore) was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of 2009 production
and purchased our share of production from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea
under a short-term sales contract, subject to renewal.  Sales to
Glencore accounted for 25% of 2009 crude oil sales, or 16% of 2009 total oil and
gas sales. No other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of
crude oil and natural gas sales in 2009. We believe that the loss of any one
purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results
of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our
production.
       
      Hedging Activities Commodity prices were
volatile in 2009 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a
variety of factors beyond our control. We have used derivative instruments, and
expect to do so in the future, in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty
and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil
and natural gas. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Hedging transactions may limit our
potential gains and We
are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging
transactions, and cash investments, Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and

      Regulations
       
      Government Regulation Exploration for, and
production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated
at the international, federal, state and local levels. Crude oil and natural gas
development and production activities are subject to various laws and
regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide
variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production,
transportation, prevention of waste and pollution and protection of the
environment. Laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under
constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently increase the
regulatory burden on companies. Our ability to economically produce and sell
crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory
factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the US and
laws and regulations of foreign nations. Many of these governmental bodies have
issued rules and regulations that are often difficult and costly to comply with,
and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws,
regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas
production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such
laws, regulations and orders. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural
gas industry increases our costs of doing business and consequently affects our
profitability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are subject to various
governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur
substantial costs.

      In January 2010, the BLM
announced that it will be issuing a new draft oil and gas leasing policy that
will require, among other things, a more detailed environmental review prior to
leasing oil and natural gas resources, increased public engagement in the
development of master leasing and development plans prior to leasing areas where
intensive new oil and gas development is anticipated, and a comprehensive parcel
review process.  As the policy has not yet been released, we are not
able to determine the impact these potential leasing policy changes may have on
our business.

      Most of
the states within which we operate have separate agencies with authority to
regulate related operational and environmental matters.  Examples of
such regulation on the operational side include the Greater Wattenberg Area
Special Well Location Rule 318A, which was adopted by the Colorado Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission to address oil and gas well drilling, production,
commingling and spacing in the Wattenberg field, and the same Commission’s
December 10, 2008 approval of a comprehensive update to statewide rules
governing oil and gas operations in Colorado. These rules were reviewed by the
Colorado legislature in its 2009 session and became effective in the second
quarter of 2009, addressing areas such as public drinking water protection,
monitoring and disclosure of chemicals used in drilling operations, erosion
management and environment and wildlife protection. On the environmental side,
Colorado Regulation Seven and requirements for storm water management plans were
adopted by the Colorado Department of Environmental Quality, under delegation
from the EPA, to regulate air emissions, water protection and waste handling and
disposal relating to our oil and gas exploration and production.
       
      Some of
the counties and municipalities within which we operate have adopted regulations
or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our oil and gas exploration
and production.  An example is Garfield County, Colorado, which
provides local land and road use restrictions affecting our Piceance basin
operations and requires us to post bonds to secure any restoration
obligations.
       
      Our
international operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by
energy-related ministries of our host countries, each having certain relevant
energy or hydrocarbons laws.  Examples of these ministries include the
Ecuador Ministry of Nonrenewable Natural Resources, the Equatorial Guinea
Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy, the Israel Ministry of National
Infrastructures, and the UK Department of Energy and Climate
Change.  An example of a law affecting our international operations is
the UK Finance Act of 2006, which increased the income tax rate on our UK
operations effective January 1, 2006.
       
      Environmental Matters As a developer, owner
and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the
discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must
take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in
planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. In most
instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of
drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control
procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Under state
and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously
disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners
or operators in accordance with current laws or otherwise, to suspend or cease
operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging
operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. The EPA and various
state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous
wastes. The owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of
or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be
liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the
release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The EPA, state
environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take
actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to
recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action.
Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas
operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in
the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to
considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. See
Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are
subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may
cause us to incur substantial costs.
       
      Federal
and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information
about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain
portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local
governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the
requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace
standards.
       
      Certain
state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in
addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described
herein.
       
      We have
made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with
environmental requirements. We do not believe that we have, to date, expended
material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such
requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. Although such requirements do have a
substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear
to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the
industry.
       
      Competition
       
      The crude oil and natural
gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from other crude
oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the
acquisition of seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties
and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of
those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural
gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies,
individuals and drilling partnership programs. Many of our competitors are
large, well established companies. Such companies may be able to pay more for
seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory
prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of
properties and
prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire
additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent
upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors –
We
face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in
excess of our available resources.

      Item 1A.  Risk Factors
       
      Described
below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the
oil and gas industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are
not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the
following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
       
      If any of
the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic environment
intensifies many of these risks.
       
      Future
economic conditions in the US and key international markets may materially
adversely impact our operating results.
       
      The US
and other world economies are slowly recovering from a recession which began in
2008 and extended into 2009. Growth has resumed, but is modest.  There
are likely to be significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and
credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth rate that is
slower than what was experienced in recent years.  In addition, more
volatility may occur before a sustainable, yet lower, growth rate is
achieved.   Global economic growth drives demand for energy from
all sources, including fossil fuels.  A lower future economic growth
rate will result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas
production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows
from operations and our profitability.

      Crude
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial reduction in these
prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common
stock.
       
      Our
revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the
prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. Historically,
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to
continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement
price for the prompt month oil contract in 2009 ranged from a high of $81.37 per
barrel to a low of $33.98 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the
prompt month natural gas contract in 2009 ranged from a high of $6.07 per MMBtu
to a low of $2.51 per MMBtu. The markets and prices for crude oil and natural
gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand for crude
oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic
conditions, and other factors, including:

      Market
conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and
working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
       
      During
2009, credit markets recovered but remain vulnerable to unpredictable shocks
should weaker than expected economic growth persist.  We have a
significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration
portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and our partners
will need to seek financing in order to fund these or other activities. Our
future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could
be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could
significantly delay development of our property interests.
       
      Failure
to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our
properties.
       
      Our
exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital
expenditures especially in the case of our active drilling programs, such as the
Wattenberg field, and our significant exploration
and development programs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and
Israel. Significant capital investments on our inventory of major development
projects will start next year and are estimated to be approximately $1
billion per year in 2010 and 2011.  First production from these
projects is not expected until 2011 and thereafter. Historically, we have funded
our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations,
our revolving bank credit facility and debt  issuances. Future cash
flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from
existing wells, prices of crude oil and natural gas, and our success in finding,
developing and producing new reserves. If revenues were to decrease as a result
of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our
access to debt or capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to
replace our reserves, resulting in a decrease in production over time. If our
cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund
our capital budget, we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic
basis to meet these requirements. If we are not able to fund our capital
expenditures, interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a
result.

      Indebtedness
may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility.
       
      As of
December 31, 2009, we had long-term indebtedness of $2 billion
(excluding unamortized discount), with $382 million drawn under our bank
credit facility. Our indebtedness represented 25% of our total book
capitalization at December 31, 2009.

      conditions.
              
            
      
       
      We may
incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and
acquisition activities such as our pending acquisition of additional US Rocky
Mountain assets. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our
liquidity may become impaired and we default on our debt obligations. Our
ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness
depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and
natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will affect our
operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our
control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the
interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity
financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.
       
      Hedging
transactions may limit our potential gains.
       
      In order
to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability
relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude
oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our
expected production. Our hedges, consisting of a series of contracts, are
limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. While intended
to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such
transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices
rise over the price established by the arrangements.
       
      Global
commodity price fluctuation has been significant in 2009. Such volatility
disrupts our ability to forecast and, as a result, we may become even more
reliant on our hedging program.  In trying to manage our exposure to
commodity price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending
upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate
in the future. In addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of
financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our
production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis
differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point
assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our futures contracts
fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially
impacts crude oil or natural gas prices.  We cannot assure that our
hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of volatility
in crude oil or natural gas prices.

      We
are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging
transactions and cash investments.
       
      We are
exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, and other
receivables.  We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety
of purchasers.   In addition, we are the operator on large joint
venture development projects such as Aseng in Equatorial Guinea and Tamar in
Israel. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and
bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture
costs. Some of our purchasers and joint venture partners are not as creditworthy
as we are and may experience liquidity problems. Credit enhancements have been
obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees or letters of
credit, including our largest international crude oil purchaser; however, not
all of our trade credit is protected through guarantees or credit
support.  Nonperformance by a trade creditor or joint venture partner
could result in significant financial losses.
       
      We
also monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing
basis. However, disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden
changes in a counterparty’s liquidity, which could impair their ability to
perform under the terms of the hedging contract. We are unable to predict sudden
changes in financial market conditions or a counterparty’s creditworthiness or
ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability
to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.
       
      Our
hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails
to perform under a contract.  To mitigate counterparty credit risk we
conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of major financial
institutions.  We use master agreements which allow us, in the event
of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting
counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability
positions with the defaulting counterparty would be “net settled” at the time of
election. “Net settlement” refers to a process by which all transactions between
counterparties are resolved into a single amount owed by one party to the
other.
       
      During
periods of falling commodity prices, such as in late 2008 and first quarter
2009, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our counterparty
exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are major
financial institutions, deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we
could incur a significant loss.
       
      We have
over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds and
short-term deposits with major financial institutions. During the first half of
2009, we shortened the duration of our bank deposits and held over 50% of our
cash and cash equivalents in US Treasury securities. We maintained this
investment posture well into the third quarter of 2009 before we started to
reduce our US Treasury holdings in favor of reinvestment back into money market
funds and time deposits with highly rated banks. We monitor the creditworthiness
of the banks and financial institutions with which we invest and review the
securities underlying our investment accounts. However, we are unable to predict
sudden changes in solvency of our financial institutions. In the event of a bank
failure, we could incur a significant loss.
       
      We
may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face, which could
result in significant financial exposure.
       
      Exploration
for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving
natural disasters and other unfortuitous events such as blowouts, cratering,
fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or
destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life,
or damage to property and the environment. Our international operations are also
subject to political risk.
       
      In
accordance with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not
all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and
deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile,
our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from
unfavorable loss severity resulting from damages to or the loss of physical
assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business
interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets. Although we
believe the coverages and amounts of insurance carried are adequate, we may not
have sufficient protection against some of the risks we face, because we chose
not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available on commercially
reasonable terms or actual losses exceed coverage limits. If an event occurs
that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.
       
      Failure
to effectively execute our major development projects could result in
significant delays and/or cost over-runs, damage to our reputation, limitations
on our growth and negative effects on our operating results.
       
      We
currently have an extensive inventory of major development projects, several of
which will take years before first production, including the Aseng oil project,
Tamar, Gunflint, and others.  Some of these projects, such as oil and
gas projects in West Africa, have a great deal of complexity. This level of
development will require significant effort from our management and technical
personnel as well as place additional burden on our financial resources and
internal financial controls. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel
with the skills necessary to bring complicated projects to successful
conclusions.
       
      In
addition, we will have increased dependency on third-party technology and
service providers and other vendors for these complex
projects.  Significant delays in delivery of essential items or
performance of services, cost overruns, vendor insolvency, or other critical
supply failure, could adversely affect development of our projects.
       
      We may
not be able to manage these and other risks effectively.

      We
may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses
and/or assets, or adjust to the effects of divestitures, causing a disruption to
our business.
       
      One
aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets
that complement or expand our current business, such as our Patina Merger in
2005, our purchase of U.S. Exploration in 2006 and the pending acquisition of
additional US Rocky Mountain assets.  This may present greater risks
for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a
part of their business strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will be
able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify
attractive opportunities, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to
complete the
acquisition due to capital market constraints, even if such capital is available
on commercially acceptable terms. If we acquire another business, we could have
difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel
and technology with our own, or could assume unidentified or unforeseeable
liabilities, resulting in a loss of value.
       
      We also
engage in portfolio rationalization, such as the sale of our interest in
Argentina in 2008, and the majority of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties in
2006. These transactions can also result in changes in operations, systems, or
management and other personnel.
       
      Organizational
modifications due to acquisitions, divestitures or portfolio rationalizations,
or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments, disrupt
ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and
adversely affect results of operations. Even if these difficulties could be
overcome, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any
acquisition, divestiture or other strategic change would be
realized.
       
      Estimates
of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise.
       
      There are
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves
and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. Reservoir
engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations
of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. In
accordance with the SEC’s revisions to rules for oil and gas reserves reporting,
which we adopted effective December 31, 2009, our reserves estimates are
based on 12-month average prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change
when actual prices increase or decrease. The estimates depend on a number of
factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results,

      For these
reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and
natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications
of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash
flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same
engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves
estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual
production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will
vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
       
      Additionally,
because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis,
those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy
production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a
reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the
area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved
undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change
in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the
discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
       
      Exploration,
development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability
exposure or the loss of production and revenues.

      Exploration
and development drilling may not result in commercially productive
reserves.
       
      We do not
always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling
operations. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we
may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic
data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to
drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced
economically, and area well data and other data may be limited or less-developed
in some of the international areas in which we explore. The cost of drilling,
completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can
adversely affect the economics of a project. Our efforts will be unprofitable if
we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough
reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. Further,
our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a
variety of factors, including:

                increases
      in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling
      rigs and equipment.
              
            
      
       
      The
unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and
other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our
exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our
budget.
       
      Our
industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling
rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the
costs of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater and their
availability may be limited, particularly in areas of high activity and demand
in which we concentrate, such as the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, and in some international locations that typically have more limited
availability of equipment and personnel, such as Ecuador, Israel and West
Africa. During periods of increasing levels of exploration and production in
response to strong demand for crude oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield
services and the costs of these services increase. Additionally, these services
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
       
      In the
current economy, even though commodity prices have fallen from the high levels
experienced in 2008, the costs of drilling rigs, equipment and supplies, though
somewhat reduced, have not decreased to the levels that existed before the
run-up in commodity prices that occurred in the first half of
2008.  If drilling costs decline significantly, our long-term drilling
rig contracts may require us to pay rates higher than the current market. See
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Contractual Obligations
for additional information on drilling rig contracts.  As a result, an
increase in profits may be more dependant on cost reduction than in previous
years.
       
      Exploration and development in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico involves significant financial
risks.
       
      Much of
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico area lacks the physical and oilfield service
infrastructure necessary for production. As a result, development of a deepwater
discovery, such as Gunflint, may be a lengthy process and require substantial
capital investment. We participate in certain other projects, such as Isabela
and Double Mountain, for which we are not the operator. If we are not the
operator of a project, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over
the project or its costs. This could prevent the realization of targeted return
on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.
       
      In
addition, there is limited availability of suitable drilling rigs, drilling
equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure,
qualified operating personnel, and deepwater drilling rigs are typically subject
to long-term contracts. This can lead to difficulty and delays in consistently
obtaining drilling rigs and other equipment and services at acceptable rates,
which, in turn, may lead to projects being delayed or increased costs. This also
makes it difficult to estimate the timing of production.
       
      We
face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in
excess of our available resources.
       
      We
operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas
exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production. We face intense
competition from a large number of independent, technology-driven companies as
well as both major and other independent crude oil and natural gas companies in

      Many of
our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of
those available to us. For example, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we compete
with major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and in international
locations such as the North Sea we compete with major integrated crude oil and
natural gas companies as well as state-controlled multinational companies.

       
      In
addition, the economic recession has increased competitive pressures. Crude oil
and natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as service and
drilling companies, are striving to improve efficiency and profitability,
primarily through cost reduction. This highly competitive environment could have
an adverse impact on our business.
       
      The marketability of our Rocky
Mountain and Gulf of Mexico production is dependent upon transportation and
processing facilities over which we may have no control.
       
      The marketability of our
production from the Rocky Mountain area and the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of
pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. We deliver
crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through gathering systems
and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on these
systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or
result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of
development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over
the transportation of our production through some firm transportation
arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable
due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available
to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change
in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and
facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and
facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.
       
      Our
international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political
developments.
       
      We have
significant international crude oil and natural gas operations compared to companies we
consider to be our peers, with approximately 44% of our 2009 consolidated sales
volumes coming from international operations. These operations may be adversely
affected by political and economic developments, including the
following:

      Our
operations and investment in Ecuador may be adversely affected by the
country's unsettled economic and political environment.
       
      The
economic and political environment in Ecuador has become increasingly
unsettled. We are aware that the Government of Ecuador is taking steps to
renegotiate contracts or, in some cases, remove international oil and gas companies from its
borders. We continue to have significant delinquent accounts and unpaid invoices
related to electricity sales from our Machala power plant, and we recently
entered into independent power purchase agreements for such sales, the long-term
effect of which on payment is unknown. On August 24, 2009, we became aware that
our proposed plan of development for the
Amistad field (offshore Ecuador), which had been submitted to Ecuador’s National
Bureau of Hydrocarbons, had been rejected. In addition, on December 31, 2009,
Ecuador’s state oil company (Petroecuador) requested that Ecuador’s Minister of
Nonrenewable Natural Resources commence termination of our production sharing
contract. On February 11, 2010, the Minister notified us of Petroecuador's
request by delivering to us a copy of a letter of non-compliance dated
December 31, 2009. The Minister provided us with
60 business days to respond to the allegations contained in the
letter. We are uncertain as to the potential outcome of this matter,
resolution of which could ultimately lead to a further reduction in the value of
our investments in Ecuador which, as of December 31, 2009, had a net book
value of approximately $72 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data – Note 3. Asset Impairments.

cause us to incur substantial costs.
       
      From time
to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws
and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and
other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these
laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future
could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We
cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and
regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our
business or financial condition.
       
      Our
business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international,
federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the
development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as
safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to
interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with
these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make
significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and
regulations.
       
      Our
operations are subject to complex international, federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations including, for example, in the case of
federal laws, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as
amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act
and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Environmental laws and regulations
change frequently and the implementation of new, or the modification of
existing, laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations. The
discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or
water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and
third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. In
addition, we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency
procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance.
       
      Increased
regulation of business practices could result in increased operating
costs.
       
      The
current trend is toward increased regulation of business practices and
additional reporting requirements. For example the EPA has recently issued the
Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule, which requires many
suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial chemicals, manufacturers of vehicles and
engines, and other facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon
dioxide equivalent per year to begin collecting greenhouse gas emissions data
under a new reporting system on January 1, 2010 with the first annual report due
March 31, 2011. We will be subject to these new reporting requirements, which
will result in additional effort on the part of our personnel. In addition,
other pending legislation, such as the pending climate change legislation that
includes establishing a “cap and trade” system for restricting greenhouse gas
emissions in the US, or pending hydraulic fracturing legislation that would
subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe
Drinking Water Act, if enacted, will require an unprecedented compliance effort
on the part of companies in the oil and gas industry. We may be required to make
significant expenditures to comply with additional reporting
requirements.
       
      The
proposed US federal budget for fiscal year 2011 includes certain provisions
that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
       
      On
February 1, 2010, the Obama administration released its proposed federal budget
for fiscal year 2011.  The proposed budget would repeal many tax
incentives and deductions that are currently used by US oil and gas companies
and impose new taxes. The provisions include: elimination of the ability to
fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the
taxation of foreign source income; levy of an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil
and gas production; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas
companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for
independent producers; and implementation of a fee on non-producing leases
located on federal lands. 
       
      If these
proposals are enacted, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which
would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also
reduce our drilling activities. Since none of these proposals have yet to be
voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact they may have
on our business.
       
      The
adoption of pending climate change legislation could result in increased
operating costs, create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or
modified facilities, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we
produce.
       
      In June 2009,
the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security
Act of 2009, also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill. The Senate’s version,
The Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, or the Boxer-Kerry Bill, has been
introduced, but has not passed. Although these bills include several differences
that require reconciliation before becoming law, both bills contain the basic
feature of establishing a “cap and trade” system for restricting greenhouse gas
emissions in the US. Under such system, certain sources of greenhouse gas
emissions would be required to obtain greenhouse gas emission “allowances”
corresponding to their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. The number of
emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet overall
emission reduction goals. As the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances
declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate
significantly. The ultimate outcome of this legislative initiative remains
uncertain.   In addition to the pending climate legislation, the
EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went
into effect January 1, 2010, and require reporting by regulated facilities by
March 2011 and
annually thereafter.  Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued
an “Endangerment Finding” under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding
greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and
future generations.  The EPA has proposed regulation that would
require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain
facilities, and may issue final rules this year. Since approximately 60% of our
2009 crude oil production and 51% of our 2009 natural gas production derive from
the US, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce
emissions of US greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased
operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the crude oil
and natural gas we produce.

      Federal
hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs and restrict our
access to oil and gas reserves.
       
      Several
proposals are before Congress that, if implemented, would subject the
process of hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under
pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. We find that
the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of
crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs. Such legislation could have a
significant impact on our development of the Wattenberg field, our largest
onshore US field.
       
      Although
it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation
regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal restrictions on hydraulic
fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could
significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as
delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.
       
      Derivatives
regulation could restrict our ability to execute commodity derivative
instruments as a hedge against fluctuating commodity prices.
       
      Various
measures are being proposed by committees of Congress, the US Treasury
Department, and other agencies to restrict the use of over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative instruments.  These proposals include, but are not limited
to, requiring cash collateral on all OTC derivatives and requiring all OTC
derivatives to be executed and settled through an exchange system.
       
      Although
we do not currently know the exact form any final legislation or rule-making
activity will take, any restriction on the use of OTC instruments could have a
significant impact on our business. Limits on the use of OTC instruments could
significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic price hedges to reduce
price uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  In addition, cash
collateral requirements could create significant liquidity issues and exchange
system trades may restrict our ability to execute derivative instruments to fit
our strategic needs.
       
      Healthcare
reform legislation could adversely impact us.
       
      On
November 7, 2009, the House of Representatives passed its healthcare reform
bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962. Among other
initiatives, this bill authorizes the creation of a national public plan that
would negotiate rates with providers and would be offered through a new national
health insurance exchange market. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed
its own version of a healthcare reform bill, the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590. The Senate bill contains no provision for a
public plan but does authorize the creation of at least two multi-state
plans.
       
      At this
time, it remains unclear how or when the differences between the two bills will
be resolved, or if a final bill ultimately will be enacted. Various healthcare
reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict what
healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state
level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us.
However, an expansion in government’s role in the US healthcare industry could
have a significant impact on our employment benefits and related
costs.
       
      We
face various risks associated with the trend toward increased activism against
oil and gas development activities.
       
      Opposition
toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing
domestically as well as in countries belonging to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international group of member countries
sharing a commitment to democratic government and market
economy.  Companies in the petroleum industry, such as us, are often
the target of activist efforts regarding safety, human rights, environmental
compliance and business practices.  Anti-development activists are
working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government
lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as development of oil
shale.

activist efforts could result in the following:

      Provisions
in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of
us.
       
      Under our
Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue
shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders.
Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the
approval of our Board of Directors as more shares would have to be acquired to
gain control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and
other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts
that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially
beneficial to our shareholders.
