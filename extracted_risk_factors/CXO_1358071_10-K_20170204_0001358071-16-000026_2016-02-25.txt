Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report,
as well as those factors summarized below:

·        
declines in the prices we receive,
or sustained depressed prices we receive, for our oil and natural gas;

·        
uncertainties about the estimated
quantities of oil and natural gas reserves;

·        
drilling and operating risks;

·        
the adequacy of our capital
resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional
borrowing capacity under our credit facility;

·        
the effects of government
regulation, permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation
or regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the export of oil and natural gas;

·        
the impact of potential changes in
our credit ratings;

·        
environmental hazards, such as
uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or
other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;

·        
difficult and adverse conditions in
the domestic and global capital and credit markets;

·        
risks related to the concentration
of our operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas;

·        
disruptions to, capacity
constraints in or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver our
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas and other processing and
transportation considerations;

·        
the costs and availability of
equipment, resources, services and personnel required to perform our drilling
and operating activities;

·        
potential financial losses or
earnings reductions from our commodity price risk-management program;

·        
risks and liabilities associated
with acquired properties or businesses;

·        
uncertainties about our ability to
successfully execute our business and financial plans and strategies;

·        
uncertainties about our ability to
replace reserves and economically develop our current reserves;

·        
general economic and business
conditions, either internationally or domestically;

·        
competition in the oil and natural
gas industry; and

·        
uncertainty concerning our assumed
or possible future results of operations.

Reserve engineering is a process of
estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be
measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the
quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost
assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the results of
drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates
that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the
schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve
estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are
ultimately recovered.

PART I

 

Item 1. Business

 

General

 

Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Concho,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) formed in February 2006, is an
independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development,
exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations
are focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, a
large onshore oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The Permian Basin
is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the United
States and is characterized by an extensive production history, long reserve
life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery potential. Currently,
the majority of the rigs running in the Permian Basin are drilling horizontal
wells. Concho’s legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of
operating and geological trends. We are also at the forefront of applying new
technologies, such as horizontal drilling and enhanced completion techniques,
throughout our three core operating areas: the New Mexico Shelf, the Delaware
Basin and the Midland Basin. On the New Mexico Shelf, we primarily target the
Yeso formation with horizontal drilling; in the Delaware Basin, we use
horizontal drilling to target the Bone Spring formation (including the Avalon
shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale formation; and in the Midland
Basin, we target the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations primarily with horizontal
drilling. Our strategy remains focused on drilling and exploration activities
on our multi-year project inventory and pursuing acquisitions that meet our
strategic and financial objectives.

 

Business and Properties

 

Our core operations are focused in the Permian
Basin, which underlies an area of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas
approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long. Commercial
accumulations of hydrocarbons occur in multiple stratigraphic horizons, at
depths ranging from approximately 1,000 feet to over 25,000 feet. At
December 31, 2015, substantially all of our 623.5 MMBoe total estimated
proved reserves were located in our core operating areas and consisted of
approximately 59 percent oil and 41 percent natural gas. We have assembled
a multi-year inventory of horizontal drilling and exploration projects,
including projects to further evaluate the regional extent and multi-pay
potential of our New Mexico Shelf, Delaware Basin and Midland Basin assets. 

 

During 2015, average NYMEX oil and natural gas
prices declined 47% and 38%, respectively, compared to 2014. This decline in oil and natural gas prices has reduced our
revenues and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically. Although we commonly engage in
commodity price risk-management initiatives, a key priority, during periods of
low prices, is maintaining our strong financial position and preserving
operational flexibility for future growth in an up-cycle. As a result of the extended decline in commodity prices,
we currently expect our 2016 capital spending and activity level to be less
than 2015.

In 2015, we drilled 85.9
percent of our wells horizontally. We will continue to evaluate converting our
identified vertical locations to horizontal opportunities, where possible. We believe
horizontal drilling is more capital efficient than vertical drilling in many
situations. In 2016, we intend to spend substantially all of our capital plan
for drilling and completion activities on horizontal opportunities.

 

We produced approximately 52.3 MMBoe, 40.9 MMBoe and 33.6
MMBoe of oil and natural gas during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During
2015, approximately 67 percent of our total production was attributable to
horizontal wells. During 2015, our total estimated proved reserves decreased by
approximately 13.7 MMBoe, despite having 157.1 MMBoe of extensions and
discoveries and 11.7 MMBoe of acquisitions, which were offset by (i) negative
price revisions of 112.2 MMBoe, (ii) current year production of 52.3 MMBoe, (iii) 10.9 MMBoe of negative revisions due to proved
undeveloped reserves reclassified to unproved reserves as they are no longer
expected to be drilled within five years, (iv) 5.7 MMBoe of other net negative
revisions resulting from technical and performance evaluations and (v) 1.4
MMBoe from various divestitures throughout the year.

(a)     
Our Standardized Measure at
December 31, 2015 was $3.7 billion. The present value of estimated future net revenues
discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent (“PV-10”)
is not a GAAP financial measure and is derived from the Standardized Measure,
which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a
computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to
the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income
taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is
relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net
cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves prior to taking into
account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for
evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas
assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of
the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this
measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil
and natural gas assets. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the
Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not
purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See
“Item 1. Business —Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.”

Core operating areas

 

New Mexico Shelf.  At December 31, 2015, we had
estimated proved reserves in this area of 197.3 MMBoe, representing 31.7
percent of our total proved reserves and 30.7 percent of our PV-10.

 

Within this area our primary objectives are the
Yeso, San Andres and Grayburg formations, with producing depths ranging from
approximately 900 feet to 7,500 feet. During 2015, we continued our horizontal
drilling of the Yeso formation.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we commenced
drilling or participated in the drilling of 99 (65 net) wells in this area. Throughout 2015, we completed 115 (73 net) wells that are producing. Additionally in 2015, we abandoned
1 (0.4 net) well that was deemed unsuccessful. During 2015, approximately 76 percent of the wells we
commenced or participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.

 

In 2016, we intend to spend approximately 11 percent of our
2016 drilling and completions capital plan on the New Mexico Shelf assets.

 

Delaware Basin. At December
31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves in this
area of 315.8 MMBoe, representing  50.7 percent of our total proved reserves and 52.5 percent of our PV-10.

 

Within this area, we utilize horizontal drilling and completion
technologies to target (i) the oil-prone Bone Spring formation that includes
(a) three Bone Spring sandstone members and (b) the Avalon shale and (ii) the
Wolfcamp shale. These formations produce from 4,700 feet to 13,500 feet for our
currently targeted activity.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
we commenced drilling or participated in the drilling of 204 (140 net) wells in
this area. Throughout 2015, we completed 228 (149 net) wells that are producing. Additionally in 2015, we abandoned
3 (3 net) wells that were deemed unsuccessful. During 2015, we continued (i) development and step-out activity
targeting the Avalon shale, Bone Spring sands and Wolfcamp shale and (ii)
evaluation of our enhanced stimulation procedures of certain horizontal wells. During 2015, substantially all of the wells we commenced or
participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.

 

In 2016, we intend to spend approximately 62 percent of our
2016 drilling and completions capital plan on our Delaware Basin assets.

 

Midland Basin. At December 31, 2015, we had
estimated proved reserves in this area of 110.0 MMBoe, representing 17.6 percent
of our total proved reserves and 16.8 percent of our PV-10.

 

Our primary objectives in the Midland Basin
area are the Spraberry and Wolfcamp zones, which are typically encountered at
depths of 7,500 feet to 10,500 feet. These formations are comprised
of a sequence of basinal, interbedded sands, shales and carbonates. On our Midland
Basin assets we are continuing to (i) develop the Wolfcamp and Spraberry zones
with horizontal drilling, (ii) delineate other potential zones on our acreage
and (iii) optimize horizontal lateral length, completion techniques and well
spacing.

 

During the
year ended December 31, 2015, we commenced drilling
or participated in the drilling of 58 (23 net) wells in this area. Throughout
2015, we completed 97 (47 net) wells that are
producing. During 2015, approximately 55 percent of the wells we commenced or
participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.

 

In 2016, we intend to spend approximately 27 percent of our
2016 drilling and completions capital plan on the Midland
Basin assets.

Our Production, Prices and Expenses

 

The following table sets forth summary
information concerning our production and operating data for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Because of normal production declines,
increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or
divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be
interpreted as being indicative of future results.

  The presentation
  of average prices with derivatives is a non-GAAP measure as a result of
  including the cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives that are
  presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average
  prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash
  performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and
  presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent
  with the presentation generally used by the investment community.

Marketing Arrangements

 

General. We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with
standard energy industry practices. The marketing effort is coordinated with
our operations group as it relates to the planning and preparation of future
drilling programs so that available markets can be assessed and secured. This
planning also involves the coordination of access to the physical facilities
necessary to connect new producing wells as efficiently as possible upon their
completion.

 

Oil. We generally 
 do not transport our oil, and
we do not refine or process the oil we produce. A significant portion of our
oil in Southeast New Mexico, primarily on the New Mexico Shelf, is connected
directly to oil gathering pipelines. Most of our gathered oil from the New
Mexico Shelf is utilized in a two-refinery complex in Southeast New Mexico. The
New Mexico portion of our Delaware Basin production is sold to approximately
twelve different oil purchasers; however, that number will decrease when our
Alpha Crude Connector pipeline joint venture becomes fully operational in 2016.
A significant portion of our West Texas production is on pipeline. Most of this
production is sweet crude and is transported by third parties to the Cushing,
Oklahoma hub or to the Gulf Coast market. The balance of our oil in these areas
that is not directly connected to pipeline is trucked to unloading stations on
those same pipelines. We sell the majority of the oil we produce under
contracts using market-based pricing. This price is then adjusted for
differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality.

 

Natural Gas. We consider all natural gas gathering and delivery
infrastructure in the areas of our production and evaluate market options to
obtain the best price reasonably available under the circumstances. We sell the
majority of our natural gas under individually negotiated natural gas purchase
contracts using market-based pricing. The majority of our natural gas is
subject to long-term agreements that generally extend five to ten years from
the effective date of the subject contract.

 

The majority of the natural gas we sell is
casinghead gas sold at the lease location under percentage of proceeds
processing contracts; however, we are currently transitioning to a mixture of
percentage of proceeds and fee based contracts. The purchaser gathers our
casinghead natural gas in the field where it is produced and transports it via
pipeline to a natural gas processing plant where natural gas liquid products
are extracted and sold by the processor. The remaining natural gas product is
residue gas, or dry gas, which is placed on residue pipeline systems available
in the area. Under our percentage of proceeds contracts, we receive a
percentage of the value for the extracted liquids and the residue gas. In a
limited number of cases (typically dry gas production), the natural gas
gathering and transportation is performed by a third-party gathering company
which transports the production from the production location to the purchaser’s
mainline.

 

Our Principal Customers

 

We sell our oil and natural gas production
principally to marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline
facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is
transported to storage facilities by trucks and rail owned or otherwise
arranged by the marketers or purchasers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas
can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be
accurately predicted.

 

For 2015, revenues from oil and natural gas
sales to Holly Frontier Refining and
Marketing, LLC, Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC and Plains Marketing and
Transportation, Inc. accounted for approximately 25
percent, 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of our total operating
revenues. While the loss of any of these purchasers may result in a temporary
interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that
the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on
our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing regions.

 

Competition

 

The oil and natural gas industry in the regions
in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from
numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major
integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in
acquiring properties. At higher commodity prices, we also face competition in
contracting for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing
trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial, technical and
personnel resources substantially larger than ours. As a result, our
competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our
financial or personnel resources will permit.

 

In addition to competition for drilling,
pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the
availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas
industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling 



8 








 



and
workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay
drilling, workover and exploration activities and cause significant price
increases. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such
shortages.

 

Material arrangements.  Competition
is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties,
undeveloped leases and drilling rights. In January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase
agreement to acquire 80 percent of the seller’s interest in certain oil and
natural gas properties and related assets in the southern Delaware Basin. As
consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to issue to the seller
approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock, $150.0 million in cash
and $40.0 million to carry a portion of the seller’s future development costs
in these properties. The acquisition is expected to close during the first
quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.

 

Working Capital

 

Based on current market conditions, we have
maintained a stable liquidity position. Our principal sources of liquidity are
cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At
December 31, 2015, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility and
more than $2.7 billion of liquidity available, including $228.6 million in cash
and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion of unused commitments under our credit
facility. Further, assuming closing of our recently announced acquisition and
disposition in the first quarter of 2016, we expect to increase our cash
position by approximately $140.0 million. Our primary needs for cash are
development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment
of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. However, additional
borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt
securities will require a greater portion of our cash flow from operations to
be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing
our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and
acquisitions. 

 

In recent years, the global economic downturn,
particularly with respect to the U.S. economy, and the global financial and
credit market disruptions have reduced the availability of liquidity and credit
to fund the continuation and expansion of certain industrial business
operations worldwide resulting in a slowdown in economic activity. This has
reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower commodity prices.
Lower commodity prices will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability, which
may make us unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms.


 

In November 2015, we announced our 2016 base
capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.4 billion. During
2016, our current intent is to adjust our capital spending to be within our
cash flows. Based on current commodity prices and costs, our capital plan is in
the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. However, if we were to outspend
our cash flows, we could use our cash on hand, credit facility and other
financing sources. We believe that we have adequate availability under our
credit facility to fund any cash flow deficits. Our liquidity position, along
with internally generated cash flows from operations and settlements from our
derivative contracts, is expected to provide continued financial flexibility as
we actively manage the pace of exploration and development activities and
acquisitions of leasehold acreage. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations––Capital Commitments,
Capital Resources and Liquidity” for additional information regarding our
liquidity and ability to fund working capital.

Applicable Laws and Regulations

 

Regulation
of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

 

Regulation of
transportation and sale of oil.  Prices
at which sales of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are made are not
currently regulated, and sales of these products are made at negotiated prices.
Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

 

Our sales of oil are affected by the
availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in
common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline
transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate
oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by
all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain
circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations
establishing an indexing system that permits an oil pipeline, subject to
limited challenges, to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates
due to inflationary changes in costs using a FERC approved index, without
making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the
appropriateness of the index in relation to industry costs. On December 17,
2015, the FERC established a new Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the
“PPI-FG”) of PPI-FG plus 1.23 percent for the five-year period beginning July
1, 2016. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of
regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates,
varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate
rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the
regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any
way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.

 

Further, interstate and intrastate
common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis
at posted tariff rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is
governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published
tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation
services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our
competitors.

 

Effective
November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007,
the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued a rule prohibiting market
manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person,
directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of oil,
gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from knowingly engaging in any
act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue
statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person, or intentionally failing to state a material fact that under
the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided
that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any
such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to
$1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under
the Federal Trade Commission Act.

 

Regulation
of transportation and sale of natural gas.  Historically,
the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have
been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “Natural Gas Act”),
the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “Natural Gas Policy Act”) and
regulations issued under those acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal
government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While
sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market
prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future, and market
participants are prohibited from engaging in market manipulation. Deregulation
of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas
Policy Act. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act,
which removed all Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act price and non-price
controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective
January 1, 1993.

 

The FERC regulates interstate natural
gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of
natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of
our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas
transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and
non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are
necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas
pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural
gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by,
among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of
transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, the FERC issued Order
No. 636 and a series of related orders to implement its open access policies.
As a result of the Order No. 636 program, the marketing and pricing of natural
gas have been significantly altered. The interstate pipelines’ traditional role
as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure
under which pipelines provide transportation and storage services on an open access
basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although these orders do not
directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased
competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.

 





10 








 



In 2000, the
FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of
additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.
Among other things, Order No. 637 effected changes in FERC regulations relating
to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first
refusal and information reporting.

 

In August 2005, Congress enacted the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, EPAct 2005
amends the Natural Gas Act to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including
otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or
manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of
natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to
regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. The
FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with
the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or
the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of
the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device,
scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading;
or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any
person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for
violations of the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act
up to $1 million per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule does not
apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional
sales, gathering or production, but does apply to activities of otherwise
non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in
connection with” natural gas sales,
purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes
the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as
described below. EPAct 2005 therefore reflects a
significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate
we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.  

 

In December 2007, the FERC issued a rule (“Order No. 704”), as clarified
in orders on rehearing, requiring that any market participant, including a
producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural
gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year to annually
report, starting May 1, 2009, such sales and purchases to the FERC. These rules
are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets
and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market
manipulation. We do not anticipate that we will be affected by these rules any
differently than other producers of natural gas.

 

We cannot accurately predict whether the
FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in
which our natural gas is sold. Additional proposals and proceedings that might
affect the natural gas industry are pending before the FERC and the courts. The
natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore,
we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach
recently established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that
any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way
it affects other natural gas producers.

 

Gathering service, which occurs upstream
of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and
in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, the FERC has
reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as
non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our
costs of getting natural gas to point of sale locations.

 

Intrastate natural gas
transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The
basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of
regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline
rates and services varies from state to state. During the 2007 legislative
session, the Texas State Legislature passed H.B. 3273 (the “Competition Bill”)
and H.B. 1920 (the “LUG Bill”). The Competition Bill gives the Railroad
Commission of Texas (the “RRC”) the ability to use either a cost-of-service
method or a market-based method for setting rates for natural gas gathering and
intrastate transportation pipelines in formal rate proceedings. It also gives
the RRC specific authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent
discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation, to enforce the
requirement that parties participate in an informal complaint process and to
penalize purchasers, transporters, and gatherers for taking discriminatory
actions against shippers and sellers. The Competition Bill also provides
producers with the unilateral option to determine whether or not
confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a producer is a
party for the sale, transportation or gathering of natural gas. The LUG Bill
modifies the informal complaint process at the RRC with procedures unique to
lost and unaccounted for natural gas issues. It extends the types of
information that can be requested, provides producers with an annual audit
right, and provides the RRC with the authority to make determinations and issue
orders in specific situations. Both the Competition Bill and the LUG Bill
became effective on September 1, 2007, and the RRC rules implementing the
RRC’s authority pursuant to the bills became effective on April 28, 2008.

 

Insofar as such regulation
within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas
shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation
of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in
which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect
our operations in any way that is of material 



11 








 



difference
from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation
rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing
of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of
our natural gas.

 

Regulation
of production.  The production of oil and natural gas is subject to
regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules,
orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations
require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning
operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have
regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the
unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of
maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the
regulation of well spacing, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The
effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that
we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations
at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations
or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a
production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. The failure to
comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties.
Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same
regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.

 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

 

General. Our
operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of
materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among
other things:

 

·        
require the acquisition of various permits before drilling
commences;

 

·        
restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various
substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and
natural gas drilling and production and saltwater disposal activities;

 

·        
limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying
within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and

 

·        
require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and
ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned
wells.

 

The regulatory burden on the
oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry
and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, environmental laws and
regulations are revised frequently, and any changes that result in more
stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the
oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating
costs.

 

The
following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to
which our business is subject.

 

Waste handling. The
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes
regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and
cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to regulatory guidance
issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the
individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes
in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids,
produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration,
development, and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under
RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil
and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as
non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For
example, from time to time various environmental groups have challenged the
EPA’s exemption of certain oil and gas wastes from RCRA. Any such change could
result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of
ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils
that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous
characteristics.

 

Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without
regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are
considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the
environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the
release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a
hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be
subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the
hazardous substances that 



12 








 



have been released into the
environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain
health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and
other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage
allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.

 

We currently own, lease, or
operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas
exploration and production for many years. Although we believe that we have
utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the
industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have
been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under
other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been
taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by
third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal
of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control.
These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject
to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required
to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated
property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.

 

Water
discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water
Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with
respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and
other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants
into regulated waters, including dredge and fill activities in regulated
wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued
by the EPA, or, in some circumstances, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the
“Corps”), or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, new EPA
and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the
Corps’ jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope
of jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, we could face increased costs and
delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in
wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it
unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of
the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In
addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under
federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to
help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum
hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and
analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general
permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal
and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal
penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of
the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.

 

Safe Drinking Water
Act. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations
generate produced water, drilling muds, and other waste streams, some of which
may be disposed via injection in underground wells situated in non-producing
subsurface formations. The drilling and operation of these injection wells are
regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”). The Underground
Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the
EPA or delegated state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum
standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities of
fluids that may be injected and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any
contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the
subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater,
potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of
fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for
remediation of affected resources, and imposition of liability by landowners or
other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property
damages, and personal injuries. While we believe that we have obtained the
necessary permits from the applicable regulatory agencies for our underground
injection wells and that we are in substantial compliance with permit
conditions and federal and state rules, any changes in the laws or regulations
or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may
affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and would ultimately increase
the cost of our operations, which costs could be significant. For example, the
RRC recently adopted new permit rules for injection wells to address these
seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, the rules
require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic
activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and
reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate
permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be,
causing seismic activity. Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events
near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related
wastewaters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether
such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut
down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. For example, in
July 2015 and January 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission issued various
orders and regulations applicable to disposal operations in specific counties
in Oklahoma. These rules require that disposal well operators, among other
things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing, make sure that their
wells are not injecting wastes into targeted formations, and/or reduce the
volumes of wastes disposed in such wells. If new regulatory initiatives are
implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in
areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to
operate may significantly increase, and our ability to continue production may
be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial position.

Air
emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), and comparable state
laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions
permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. Federal and state
regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for
non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated
state laws and regulations. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues
to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants
at specified sources.

 

For example, in October
2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for
ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised
NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our
ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for
pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. In
addition, the EPA has adopted new rules under the CAA that require the
reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and
refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are
conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completion
(“REC”) techniques, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also
establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production related
wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage
vessels. More recently, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that
would establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain
equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including
production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s proposed
rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from
equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically
fractured oil and natural gas well completions. In addition, the rule package
would extend existing volatile organic compound, or VOC, standards under the
EPA’s Subpart OOOO of the New Source Performance Standards to include
previously unregulated equipment within the oil and natural gas source
category.

 

Climate change.   In response to
findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse
gases”, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment,
the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under
existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe
emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit
requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted
rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large
greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain
onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis.
Recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to
the scope of the greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rule. These new
sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and
workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include
the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain
facilities. In addition, as part of the Obama Administration’s overall strategy
to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45
percent from 2012 levels by 2025, the EPA and other federal agencies have or
are in the process of proposing new rules related to the control of methane
emissions. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that
would establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain
equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including
production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s proposed
rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from
equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically
fractured oil and natural gas well completions. More recently, in January 2016,
the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”)
issued proposed rules limiting the venting and flaring of natural gas from oil
and natural gas activities on federal lands. Increased regulation of methane
and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance costs and,
consequently, adversely affect our operations.

 

While Congress has from time to time
considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been
significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce emissions of
GHGs in recent years. In the absence of Congressional action, many states have
taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through regional GHG
cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring
major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers
of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and
surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase
is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction
goal.

 

The adoption of legislation or regulatory
programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased
operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control
systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or to comply with new regulatory or
reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also
increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and
natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to
reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that
some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the
earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects,
such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and
other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to
stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock
formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water,
sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the
surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic
fracturing as part of our operations. The process is typically regulated by
state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory
authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities
involving the use of diesel and issued guidance in February 2014 governing such
activities. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the CAA
establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air
emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to
disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and
also proposed in April 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from
hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more
stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American
Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed
implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued.

 

At the state level,
several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could
impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction
requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, New Mexico
adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid disclosure requirements in February 2012,
and the RRC adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards
for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby
water resources in May 2013. In addition, local governments have also taken
steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing, including imposing restrictions or
moratoria on oil and gas activities occurring within their boundaries. For
example, in 2013, Mora County, New Mexico banned hydraulic fracturing. However,
the ban was challenged in U.S. District Court and was subsequently overturned.
We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal
requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities.
Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal
restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas
where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply
with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of
exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be
precluded from drilling wells.

 

In addition,
certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus
on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House
Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review
of hydraulic fracturing practices. Additionally, in June 2015, the EPA released
its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking
water resources. The EPA report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities
have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the
United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which
hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water
resources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment
period and a formal review by the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. Other
governmental agencies, including the United States Department of Energy and the
United States Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects
of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur
initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or
other regulatory mechanisms.

 

We do not have
insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses
solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our
general liability and excess liability insurance policies may cover third-party
claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses
in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. If new laws or
regulations significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing activities or impose
burdens on new permitting or operating requirements, our ability to utilize
hydraulic fracturing may be curtailed, and this may in turn reduce the amount
of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our
reserves.

 

Operations on Federal Lands. We currently operate on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the
BLM. Permitting for oil and gas activities on federal lands can take
significantly longer than the state permitting process. Delays in obtaining
permits necessary can disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our
business. In addition, in January 2016, the BLM issued a proposed rule which
seeks to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas activities on federal lands
by limiting venting and flaring of natural gas from wells and other equipment.
The proposal also clarifies when operators owe royalties on flared gas, and
would provide the agency greater flexibility to set royalty rates at or above
12.5 percent of the value of production. These rules could result in increased
compliance costs for our operations, which in turn could have an adverse effect
on our business and results of operations.

 

Endangered species.   The federal
Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities
that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of
our drilling operations are conducted in areas where protected species are
known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement
plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we may be
prohibited from conducting drilling operations in certain locations or during
certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations
could have an adverse effect 



15 








 



on the species. It is
also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to
drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such
activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The
presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling activities
could impair our ability to timely complete drilling and developmental
operations and could adversely affect our future production from those areas. Moreover, as a
result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to
make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened
under the ESA before the completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The
designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in
areas where we or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers
operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from
species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our
customers’ performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our
midstream services.

 

National Environmental
Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on
federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).
NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to
evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the
environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an
environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and
cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more
detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public
review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities,
as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require
governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process
has the potential to delay or even halt development of some of our oil and
natural gas projects.

 

OSHA and
other laws and regulations. We
are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication
standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of
CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose
information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also,
pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
established a variety of standards relating to workplace exposure to hazardous
substances and employee health and safety. We believe that we are in
substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of OSHA and comparable
laws.

 

We do not believe that
compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our
current operations will have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations. For instance, we did not incur any
material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities
during 2015. Additionally, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of
any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital
expenditures during 2016. However, we cannot assure you that the passage or
application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a
negative impact on our financial position or results of operations.

 

Our Employees

 

Our corporate headquarters are located at One Concho
Center, 600 West Illinois Avenue, Midland, Texas 79701. We also maintain

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations

 

PV-10

 

PV-10 is derived from the standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable
date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We
believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors
because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our
estimated proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income
taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary
significance of our oil and natural gas assets. Further, investors may utilize
the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our
reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential
return on investment related to our oil and natural gas assets. PV-10, however,
is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows. Our PV-10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas
reserves.

 

During 2015, average NYMEX oil and natural gas
prices declined 47% and 38%, respectively, compared to 2014.  Our PV-10
declined significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the sharp
decline in commodity price. The following table provides a reconciliation of
PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

EBITDAX

 

We define EBITDAX as net income, plus
(1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of
long-lived assets, (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6)
(gain) loss on derivatives, (7) cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives,
(8) loss on disposition of assets and other, (9) interest expense, (10)
loss on extinguishment of debt, (11) federal and state income taxes from
continuing operations and (12) similar items listed above that are presented in
discontinued operations. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as
determined by GAAP.

 

Our EBITDAX measure provides additional
information which may be used to better understand our operations, and it is
also a material component of one of the financial covenants under our credit
facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental
financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be
considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an
indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are
significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial
performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as
the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX, as used by us,
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance
and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of
our consolidated financial statements, including by lenders pursuant to a
covenant in our credit facility. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our
operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent
exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital
structure, and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our
company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis. Further,
under our credit facility, an event of default could arise if we were not able
to satisfy and remain in compliance with our specified financial ratio, defined
as the maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated last
twelve months EBITDAX of no greater than 4.25 to 1.0. Non-compliance with this
ratio could trigger an event of default under our credit facility, which then
could trigger an event of default under our indentures.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

 

You should consider carefully the following
risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report
and other reports filed with the SEC before investing in our securities. If any
of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial
condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In
that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose
all or part of your investment.

 

Risks Related to Our Business

 

Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices are volatile and have
continued to decline significantly over the past year. An extended continuation
of, or a further decline in, oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquid prices could adversely affect our financial position,
financial results, cash flow, access to capital and ability to grow.

 

Our future financial
condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying
value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we
receive for our oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from
time to time for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Oil, natural gas,
and natural gas liquid prices historically have been volatile, and are likely
to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical
conditions. This price volatility also affects the amount of cash flow we have
available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise
additional capital. The prices and levels of production for oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control,
including:

 

·        
the level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids;

 

·        
the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas, and natural
gas liquids;

 

·        
inventory levels of Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark for WTI oil
prices;

 

·        
liquefied natural gas deliveries to and from the United States;

 

·        
commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability
and the availability of refining capacity;

 

·        
the price and level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;

 

·        
the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil
price and production controls;

 

·        
domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

 

·        
the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;

 

·        
weather conditions;

 

·        
political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas
producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa and South America;

 

·        
technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy
supply; 

 

·        
effect of energy conservation efforts;

 

·        
variations between product prices at sales points and applicable
index prices; and

 

·        
worldwide economic conditions.

 

Furthermore, oil and natural
gas prices continued to be volatile in 2015. For example, the NYMEX oil prices
in 2015 ranged from a high of $61.43 to a low of $34.73 per Bbl and the NYMEX
natural gas prices in 2015 ranged from a high of $3.23 to a low of $1.76 per
MMBtu. Further, the NYMEX oil prices and NYMEX natural gas prices reached lows
of $26.21 per Bbl and $1.80 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from
January 1, 2016 to February 22, 2016.

A
significant portion of our total natural gas revenues are derived from the
value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the
remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. In the
past, our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural
gas liquids included in our natural gas revenues resulted in our realized
natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) being greater than the
related NYMEX natural gas price. However, during the year ended December 31,
2015, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives)
fell below the related NYMEX natural gas price primarily due to the average
Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids decreasing to
$17.80 per Bbl, as compared to $34.58 per Bbl during the year ended December
31, 2014.

 

Declines in oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquid prices would not only reduce our revenue,
but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically. This in turn would lower the amount of oil and natural gas
reserves we could recognize and, as a result, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the oil and natural gas industry continues to experience significant
price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to maintain or increase
our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness or obtain
additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can adversely affect the
value of our securities.

 

Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value
of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect our
results of operations.

 

Declines in commodity prices
may result in us having to make substantial downward adjustments to the value
of our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of
production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to
write-down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our proved
oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform
impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent
such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated
future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may
not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. The primary factors that
may affect management’s estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity
futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital
costs, (iii) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to
proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves,
(iv) cash flows from integrated assets and (v) results of future drilling
activities. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could
materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred. 

 

Additionally, based on the
factors above, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that undiscounted
future cash flows attributable to certain depletion groups with a net book
value of approximately $5.2 billion indicated that the carrying amount was
expected to be recovered; however, it may be at risk for impairment if
management’s estimates of future cash flows decline, including as a result of
further declines in projected commodity prices (and the resulting impact of
future cash flows) subsequent to December 31, 2015. We estimate that, if these
depletion groups were to become impaired in a future period, we could recognize
non-cash impairment in that period of approximately $2.5 billion.

 

Approximately 42.5 percent of our total estimated proved reserves at
December 31, 2015 were undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be
developed.

 

At
December 31, 2015, approximately 42.5 percent
of our total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of
undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful
drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures
and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not
prove correct. Our reserve report at December 31, 2015 includes estimates of
total future development costs over the next five years associated with our
proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $3.0 billion. If we choose not to
spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to
successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these
reserves. In addition, under the SEC’s reserve rules, because proved
undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells planned to be
drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to
write-off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this
five-year timeframe. For example, as of December 31, 2015, we wrote-off
approximately 10.9 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves because we have
deferred development outside the five-year window primarily as a result of our
transition from a vertical to horizontal drilling program. Any such write-offs
of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the
value of our securities.

 

Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities
with many uncertainties that could cause our costs to increase or production
volumes to decrease, which would reduce our cash flows.

 

Our
future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success
of our exploration and production activities. Our oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our
control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially
viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, 



20 








 



explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties
will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and
geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of
which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of
drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before
drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can
make a particular project uneconomical or less economical than forecasted.
Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the
following:

 

·        
delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and
contractual requirements;

 

·        
reductions in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices;

 

·        
pressure or irregularities in geological formations;

 

·        
shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified
personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;

 

·        
equipment failures or accidents;

 

·        
adverse weather conditions;

 

·        
environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills,
pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive
materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and
completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and
subsurface environment;

·        
limited availability of financing at acceptable terms; 

 

·        
surface access restrictions;

 

·        
loss of title or other title related issues;

 

·        
oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering, transportation
and processing availability restrictions or limitations; and

 

·        
limitations in the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids.

 

Prolonged decreases in our
drilling program may require us to pay certain non-use fees or impact our
ability to comply with certain contractual requirements. 

 

Oil
prices declined substantially during the second half of 2014 and continued to
decline through 2015. In the event that oil and natural gas prices remain
depressed for a sustained period, or continue to further decline, we may
experience significant decreases in drilling activity. Due to the nature
of our drilling programs and the oil and natural gas industry generally, we are
a party to certain agreements that require us to meet various contractual
obligations or require us to utilize a certain amount of goods or services,
including, but not limited to, water commitments, throughput volume commitments
and power commitments. In the event that oil and natural gas prices remain
depressed, and as a result continue to reduce the demand for drilling and production,
this could lead to a decrease in our drilling activity and production levels,
which could, in turn, require us to pay for unutilized goods or services or
impact our ability to meet these contractual obligations.

 

We may incur losses as a
result of title defects in our oil and natural gas properties.

 

It
is our practice to initially conduct only a cursory title review of the oil and
natural gas properties on which we do not have proved reserves. To the extent
title opinions or other investigations prior to our commencement of drilling
operations reflect defects affecting such properties, we are typically
responsible for curing any such defects at our expense. Additionally, the
discovery of any such defects could delay or prohibit the commencement of drilling
operations on the affected properties. These impacts and other potential
losses resulting from title defects in our oil and natural gas properties could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Federal, state
and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing,
as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased
costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our
production.

Hydraulic
fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate
production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. We routinely utilize
hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion
programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under
pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate
production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas
commissions. However, the EPA recently asserted federal regulatory authority
over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA’s
Underground Injection Control Program and issued guidance in February 2014,
governing such activities. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the
CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of
air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and advanced notice of
proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies
to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing,
and also proposed in April 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from
hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
In addition, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized rules in March
2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic
fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The United States District
Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision
has not yet been issued.

At the state level, several states have adopted or are
considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting,
disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing
activities. For example, New Mexico adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid
disclosure requirements in February 2012 and in May 2013, and the RRC adopted
rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that
hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources in
May 2013. In addition, local governments have also taken steps to regulate
hydraulic fracturing, including imposing restrictions or moratoria on oil and
gas activities occurring within their boundaries. For example, in 2013, Mora
County, New Mexico banned hydraulic fracturing. However, the ban was challenged
in U.S. District Court and was subsequently overturned. We believe that we
follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for
groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if
new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to
the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we
could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such
requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration,
development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from
drilling wells. 

In addition, certain governmental reviews are
either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic
fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is
coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices.
Additionally, in June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on
drinking water resources. The EPA report concluded that hydraulic fracturing
activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources
in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by
which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking
water resources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public
comment period and a formal review by the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. Other governmental agencies, including the United States
Department of Energy and the United States Department of the Interior, are
evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or
proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic
fracturing under the federal SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.

If new laws
or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted,
such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing
to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic
fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal
legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities
could become subject to additional permitting requirements and could also
result in permitting delays and potential cost increases. Restrictions on
hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that
we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.

 

Our operations are substantially dependent on the
availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may
have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

 

Water is an essential component of both
the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have
been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in
our operations. Over the past few years, extreme drought conditions
persisted in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Although conditions have
improved, we cannot guarantee what conditions may occur in the future. Severe
drought conditions can result in local water districts taking steps to restrict
the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic
fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to
obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to
economically 



22 








 



produce oil and natural gas, which could
have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

 

Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise.
The actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net cash flows may
prove to be lower than estimated.

 

Numerous
uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net
cash flows therefrom. Our estimates of proved reserves and related future net
cash flows are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be
inaccurate.

 

Petroleum engineering is a
subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that
cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable
oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number
of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:

 

·        
historical production from the area compared with production from
other producing areas;

 

·        
the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;

 

·        
the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant
data;

 

·        
assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and

 

·        
assumptions concerning future operating costs; severance, ad
valorem and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs.

 

Because all reserve
estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items, or other
items not identified below, may differ materially from those assumed in
estimating reserves:

 

·        
the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;

 

·        
the production and operating costs incurred;

 

·        
the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and

 

·        
future commodity prices.

 

Furthermore, different
reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based
on the same data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect
to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be
material.

 

As required by the SEC, the estimated
discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average previous
twelve months first-of-month prices preceding the date of the estimate and
costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may
be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected
by factors such as:

 

·        
the amount and timing of actual production; 

 

·        
levels of future capital spending;

 

·        
increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas; and

 

·        
changes in governmental regulations or taxation.

 

Accordingly, estimates included herein
of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash
flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the estimates of discounted
future net cash flows in this report should not be construed as accurate
estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves.

Our business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable
to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which
could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.

 

The
oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to
continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. At
December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt under our credit facility
(and total debt at December 31, 2015 was $3.3 billion), and we had
approximately $2.5 billion of unused commitments under our credit facility.
Expenditures for acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural
gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. We incurred
approximately $2.1 billion in acquisition, exploration and development
activities (excluding asset retirement obligations) during the year ended
December 31, 2015. In November 2015, we announced our 2016 base capital
budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.4 billion. During
2016, our current intent is to adjust our capital spending to be within our
cash flows. Based on current commodity prices and costs, our capital plan is in
the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. We plan to spend approximately
$3.0 billion over the next five years on future development costs associated
with proved undeveloped reserves.

 

We intend to finance our
future capital expenditures, other than significant acquisitions, through cash flow
from operations and through borrowings under our credit facility; however, our
financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization
substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance
of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of
our common stock. Additional borrowings under our credit facility or the
issuance of additional debt securities will require that a greater portion of
our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal
on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, our credit
facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness
other than indebtedness under our credit facility. If we desire to issue
additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit
facility, we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance
with the requirements of the credit facility, which consent may be withheld by
the lenders at their discretion. If we incur certain additional indebtedness,
our borrowing base under our credit facility may be reduced. Additional
financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event
additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail drilling,
development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an
untimely or unfavorable basis.

 

Our cash flow from
operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables,
including:

 

·        
our proved reserves;

 

·        
the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from
existing wells;

 

·        
the prices at which our commodities are sold; 

 

·        
the costs of producing oil and natural gas;

 

·        
global credit and securities markets; 

 

·        
the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide
capital and the cost of the capital;

 

·        
our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and

 

·        
the impact of potential changes in our credit ratings.

 

If our revenues or the
borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower
commodity prices or sustained depressed commodity prices, operating
difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for
any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary
to sustain our operations at current or anticipated levels. As a result, we may
require additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be able to
obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, to
satisfy our capital requirements. If cash generated from operations or
borrowings available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our
capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result
in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our
prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas
reserves, and could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of
operations.

Declining
general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

 

In recent years, the global economic
downturn, particularly with respect to the U.S. economy, and the global
financial and credit market disruptions have reduced the availability of
liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business
operations worldwide resulting in a slowdown in economic activity. This has
reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower commodity prices.

 

Lower commodity prices will reduce our
cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or
financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves
as existing reserves are depleted. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the
amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, which could
ultimately decrease our net revenue and profitability.

 

We have
substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels
of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse
developments in our business. 

 

We had approximately
$3.3 billion of outstanding debt at December
31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the borrowing base under our credit facility
was $3.25  billion and commitments from our
bank group totaled $2.5 billion, of which $2.5 billion
was unused commitments.

 

As a result of our indebtedness, we will
need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the
amount we will have available to fund our operations and other business
activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to
changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness
under our credit facility is at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in
interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not
have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges. The amount of our debt may
also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse
developments in our business. 

 

We may incur substantially more debt in
the future. The indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictions on
our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are
subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance
with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the indentures.


 

Our ability to meet our debt obligations
and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be
affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many
of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to
service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell
additional equity on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at
all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive
covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that
indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

 

Our lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially
impact our operations.

 

At December 31, 2015, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility, and
our borrowing base was $3.25 billion and commitments from our bank group
totaled $2.5 billion. The borrowing base under our
credit facility is redetermined annually based upon a number of factors,
including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, between
redeterminations we and, if requested by 66 2/3 percent of our lenders, our
lenders, may each request one special redetermination. Upon a redetermination,
our borrowing base could be substantially reduced, and in the event the amount
outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at
such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings.
We expect to utilize cash on hand, cash flow from operations, bank borrowings,
debt and equity financings and asset sales to fund our acquisition, exploration
and development activities. A reduction in our borrowing base could limit our
activities. In addition, we may significantly alter our capitalization in order
to make future acquisitions or develop our properties. These changes in
capitalization may significantly increase our level of indebtedness. If we
incur additional debt for these or other purposes, the related risks that we
now face could intensify. A higher level of indebtedness also increases the
risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt
obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future
performance which is affected by general economic conditions and financial,
business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

 

A downgrade in our credit rating could
negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.

 





25 








 



We receive debt
credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are subject to regular
reviews. S&P and Moody’s consider many factors in determining our ratings
including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset
and reserve mix. 

 

On December 16, 2015,
Moody’s announced that it placed the ratings of 29 U.S. exploration and
production companies, including us, on review for downgrade. At December 31,
2015, our long-term debt was rated “Ba1” with an outlook under review. Since
that action, Moody’s lowered its oil price estimates and placed additional
exploration and production companies on review for downgrade. With Moody’s
reduced expectations for the likely range of prices and deteriorating industry
conditions, there is an increased possibility for multi-notch downgrades as an
outcome of the review process. The ultimate outcome of the ratings review for
any particular exploration and production company will depend on such company’s
particular credit attributes. On February 11, 2016, Moody’s affirmed our rating
as “Ba1” and assigned a stable outlook. 

 

At December 31, 2015, our
long-term debt was rated BB+ with a stable outlook by S&P. On February 9,
2016, S&P affirmed our rating as part of a broader review of 45 exploration
and production companies. Of the 45 companies under review by S&P, 20
companies’ ratings were affirmed while 25 companies’ ratings were downgraded.

 

A downgrade in our credit
ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to
effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit
ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and
the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. These
and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

As of the filing of this
report, no additional changes in our credit ratings have occurred; however, we
cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future.

 

Our operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with
respect to environmental and operational safety matters.

 

We may incur significant
delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety
requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, development and
production, and related saltwater disposal activities. These delays, costs and
liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to protection of the environment, health and safety,
including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become
increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal
penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in
some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring
discontinuation of certain operations. In addition, claims for damages to
persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the
environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.

 

Strict as well as joint and
several liability for a variety of environmental costs may be imposed on us under
certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the
conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in
compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New
laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose
unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. No assurance can
be given that continued compliance with existing or future environmental laws
and regulations will not result in a curtailment of production or processing
activities or result in a material increase in the costs of production,
development, exploration or processing operations. If
we are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased
revenues, our production, revenues and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

 

Our producing properties are concentrated in the Permian Basin of
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated
with operating in one major geographic area. In addition, we have a large
amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons
within this area.

 

Our
producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. At December 31, 2015, substantially
all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties
located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be
disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors,
delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by
governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints,
market limitations, severe weather events, water shortages or other drought
related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil,
natural gas or natural gas liquids. 

 





26 








 



In
addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described
above, at December 31, 2015, approximately: (i) 29 percent
of our proved reserves were attributable to the Yeso formation, which includes
both the Paddock and Blinebry intervals, underlying our oil and natural gas
properties located in Southeast New Mexico; (ii) 25 percent
of our proved reserves were attributable to the Bone Spring formation located
in the Delaware Basin; and  (iii) 17 percent
of our proved reserves were attributable to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry
formations in West Texas. This concentration of assets within a small number of
producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in
field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or
temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.

 

We periodically evaluate our unproved oil and natural gas properties for
impairment and could be required to recognize non-cash charges to earnings of
future periods.

 

At December 31, 2015, we carried unproved property costs of $0.9
billion. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a
project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These
evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration activities, intent
of future exploration activities, commodity price circumstances, planned future
sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, future drilling plans, contracts
and permits appurtenant to such projects. Based on our evaluations, we may
determine that we are unable to fully recover the cost invested in each
project, and we will recognize non-cash charges to earnings in future periods.

 

Part of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling
in new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are
uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling
results are unsuccessful.

 

The
results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain
than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established
production. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no
production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas
to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling,
completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially
expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling
results are unsuccessful.

 

Our commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego
additional future profits or result in our making cash payments to our
counterparties.

 

To reduce our exposure to
changes in the prices of commodities, we have entered into and may in the
future enter into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for a
portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have
entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a
portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed
period of time. Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the
risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in
commodity prices in some circumstances, including the following:

 

·        
the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract may
default on its contractual obligations to us;

 

·        
there may be a change in the expected differential between the
underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement and actual
prices received; or

 

·        
market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to
receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties.

 

Our commodity price risk
management activities could have the effect of reducing our net income and the
value of our securities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a net derivative
asset of approximately $819.5 million. An
average increase in the commodity price of $5.00 per barrel of oil and $0.50
per MMBtu for natural gas from the commodity price at December 31, 2015 would have
resulted in a decrease in our net asset of approximately $196.9  million. We may continue to incur
significant gains or losses in the future from our commodity price risk
management activities to the extent market prices increase or decrease and our
derivatives contracts remain in place.

 

Our identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion
opportunities are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to
uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their
drilling.

 

We have identified and
scheduled the drilling of certain of our drilling locations as an estimation of
our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. These
identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our
ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of
uncertainties, including: (i) our ability to timely drill 



27 








 



wells on lands subject to complex development terms and
circumstances; (ii) the availability of capital, equipment, services and
personnel; (iii) weather conditions; (iv) regulatory and third-party approvals;
(v) commodity prices; (vi) access to and availability of water sourcing
and distribution systems; and (vii) drilling and recompletion costs and
results. Additionally,
changes in the laws or regulations on which we rely in planning and executing
our drilling programs could adversely impact our ability to successfully
complete those programs. Because of these and other potential uncertainties, we may never
drill the potential locations we have identified or produce oil or natural gas
from these or any other potential locations. As such, our actual development
activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could
adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.

 

Unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production
will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to raise
capital and the value of our securities.

 

Unless we conduct successful
development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved
reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced.
Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by
declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics
and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and
therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our
success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and
economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of
our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if
we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may
not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves
to replace our current and future production.

 

The Standardized Measure and PV-10 of
our estimated reserves are not accurate estimates of the current fair value of
our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves.

 

Standardized Measure is a
reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural
gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our non-GAAP
financial measure, PV-10, is a similar reporting convention that we have
disclosed in this report. Both measures require the use of operating and
development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, they
will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for
oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, nor may it
reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil
and natural gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future
net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that
are ultimately received. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor, which is
required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes,
may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in
effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and
natural gas industry in general. Therefore, Standardized Measure or PV-10
included in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the
current fair value of our proved reserves.  

 

Our reserve estimates and
our computation of future net cash flows are based on SEC pricing of (i) $46.79  per
Bbl WTI posted oil price and (ii) $2.59  per MMBtu Henry Hub spot
natural gas price, adjusted for location and quality by property. The SEC
pricing for reserves as of December 31, 2015 is higher than the NYMEX oil price
and NYMEX natural gas price of $31.48 per Bbl and $1.82 per MMBtu, respectively,
at February 22, 2016. If current pricing measures were used, estimates of our
reserves and PV-10 would be lower. For example, if average oil prices were $5.00
per barrel lower than the average price we used, our PV-10 at December 31,
2015 would have decreased from $4.3 billion
to $3.6 billion. If average natural gas prices were $0.50 per MMBtu lower
than the average price we used, our PV-10 at December 31, 2015, would have
decreased from $4.3 billion to $4.0 billion. Any adjustments to the estimates
of proved reserves or decreases in the price of our commodities may decrease
the value of our securities. 

 

We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully
integrate acquired companies or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt
our business and hinder our ability to grow.

 

One
aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses or assets
that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify
attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive
candidates, we may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on
commercially acceptable terms.

 

In addition, our credit
facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose certain
limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions.
Our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes also limit
our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our
ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses or assets. If we desire to
engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit facility or
the indentures governing our senior notes, we will be required to seek the
consent of our lenders or the holders of the senior notes in accordance with 



28 








 



the requirements of the credit facility or the
indentures, which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit
facility or such holders of senior notes at their sole discretion.

 

If we acquire another
business or assets, we could have difficulty integrating its operations,
systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. These
difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and
employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of
operations. In addition, we may incur additional debt or issue additional
equity to pay for any future acquisitions, subject to the limitations described
above.

 

Any acquisition we complete is subject to substantial risks that could
adversely affect our business, including the risk that our acquisitions may
prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating
recoverable reserves and could expose us to potentially significant
liabilities.

 

We
obtained a significant portion of our current reserve base through acquisitions
of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We expect that acquisitions
will continue to contribute to our future growth. In connection with these and
potential future acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due
diligence. The
success of any acquisition involves potential risks, including among other
things:

 

·        
the inability to estimate accurately the costs to develop the
reserves, recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and
future net cash flows attainable from the reserves;

 

·        
the assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental
liabilities, and losses or costs for which the Company is not indemnified or
for which the indemnity the Company receives is inadequate;

 

·        
the effect on our liquidity or financial leverage of using
available cash or debt to finance acquisitions;

 

·        
the diversion of management's attention from other business
concerns; and

 

·        
an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to
manage and operate our growing business and assets.

 

Successful acquisitions of
oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors,
including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves,
exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential
environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact,
and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In
connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties
that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However,
such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition,
our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the
properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not
inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover
structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise.

 

There
may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired
assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation
or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely
affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We are sometimes
able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities,
including environmental liabilities, but we generally acquire interests in
properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of
representations and warranties. In addition, even when we are able to obtain
such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations
usually expire over time and expose us to potential unindemnified liabilities,
which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of
operations.

 

Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could
delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to obtain such
equipment, services and personnel.

 

The
demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct
field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals
in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in
correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically,
there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other
oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with
the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant
increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher commodity
prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling
and workover rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. It is
beyond our control and ability to predict whether these conditions will exist
in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. These types
of shortages or price increases could significantly 



29 








 



decrease
our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, or restrict our ability to
drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and
budgeted or which we may plan in the future.

 

Our exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially
productive reserves.

 

Drilling
activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially
productive reservoirs will not be encountered. New wells that we drill may not
be productive, or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such
wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know
conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may
be produced economically. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves
unprofitable results, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are
productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at
then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The
cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost
factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling
operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous
factors, including:

 

·        
unexpected drilling conditions;

 

·        
title problems;

 

·        
pressure or irregularities in formations;

 

·        
equipment failures or accidents;

 

·        
fracture stimulation accidents or failures;

 

·        
adverse weather conditions;

 

·        
compliance with environmental and other governmental or
contractual requirements; and

 

·        
increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
availability of, electricity, water, supplies, materials, drilling or workover
rigs, equipment and services.

 

We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability
claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may
not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against,
these risks.

 

We
are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from
uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities, including
well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, are
subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and
producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:

 

·        
environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil,
natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the
environment, including groundwater contamination;

 

·        
abnormally pressured or structured formations;

 

·        
mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and
service tools and casing collapse;

 

·        
blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;

 

·        
personal injuries and death; and

 

·        
natural disasters.

 

Any of these risks could
adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial
losses to us as a result of:

 

·        
injury or loss of life;

 

·        
damage to and destruction of property and equipment;





30 








 



 

·        
damage to natural resources due to underground migration of
hydraulic fracturing fluids;

 

·        
pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or
mishandling of recovered hydraulic fracturing fluids;

 

·        
regulatory investigations and penalties;

 

·        
suspension of our operations; and

 

·        
repair and remediation costs.

 

We may elect not to obtain
insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive
relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks
generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not
covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect
on our production, revenues and results of operations.

 

Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it
more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and
secure trained personnel.

 

We operate in a highly
competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas
and securing trained personnel. Some of our competitors possess and employ
financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which
can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies
may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and
exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of
properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In
addition, those companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to
attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to
attract and retain qualified personnel may increase substantially in the
future. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop
reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select
suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive
environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for
investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete
successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing
reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel
and raising additional capital. Our failure to acquire properties, market oil
and natural gas and secure trained personnel and adequately compensate
personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and
results of operations.

 

Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to
oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.

 

Market conditions or the
unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing or transportation
arrangements may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid
markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil
and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand
for and supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the proximity of
reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities
and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our
production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical,
operational or weather related matters, including hurricanes and other severe
weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial
part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems,
pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our
failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be required to shut in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to
lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil, natural gas liquid or
natural gas pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If
that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells
until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.

 

We are subject to complex
federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely
affect the cost, timing, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or
that may subject us to fines or penalties for any failure to comply.

 

Our oil and natural gas
exploration, development and production, and related saltwater disposal
operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order
to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we
must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from
various federal, state, local and governmental authorities. We may incur
substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with
these existing laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with the existing
laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, including fines and
penalties, in order to come back into compliance. In addition, our costs of
compliance may increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected
if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if the 



31 








 



government agencies responsible for enforcing certain
existing laws and regulations applicable to us change their priorities or
policies, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.
These and other costs could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues
and results of operations.

 

Future legislation may impose new
taxes or fees on crude oil or natural gas, including by eliminating or reducing
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil
and natural gas exploration and development. 

 

Budgets proposed
by President Obama have included proposals that would, among other things,
eliminate or reduce certain key United States federal income tax incentives
currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the
percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the
elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development
costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production
activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain
geological and geophysical expenditures. 

 

It is unclear whether any such changes
will actually be enacted or, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become
effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal,
tax reform efforts, or any other similar change in United States federal income
tax law could affect certain tax deductions that are currently available to us
with respect to our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Additionally, President Obama has proposed, as part of the Budget of the United
States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, to impose an “oil fee” of $10.25 per barrel
equivalent of crude oil.  This fee would be collected on domestically
produced and imported petroleum products.  If enacted into law, the fee
would be phased in over five years, beginning October 1, 2016.  The
adoption of this, or similar proposals, could result in increased operating
costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn
could affect the prices companies such as ours receive for our oil.

 

Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of
“greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand
for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.

 

In response to findings that emissions
of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment
to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to
restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA.
These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction
and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA
has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from
specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well
as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual
basis. Recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new
sources to the scope of the greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rule.
These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions
and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also
include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain
facilities. In addition, as part of the Obama Administration’s overall strategy
to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent
from 2012 levels by 2025, the EPA and other federal agencies have or are in the
process of proposing new rules related to the control of methane emissions. For
example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish
new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and
processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production,
processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s proposed rule
package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from
equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically
fractured oil and natural gas well completions. More recently, in January 2016,
the BLM issued proposed rules limiting the venting and flaring of natural gas
from oil and natural gas activities on federal lands. Increased regulation of
methane and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance
costs and, consequently, adversely affect our operations.

 

While Congress has from time to time
considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been
significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce emissions of
GHGs in recent years. In the absence of Congressional action, many states have
taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through regional GHG
cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring
major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers
of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and
surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase
is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction
goal.

 

The adoption of
legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us
to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate
emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new
regulatory or reporting requirements. For example, pursuant to President
Obama’s Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, the EPA proposed in August 2015 regulations
that will set methane emission standards for new and

modified
oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities
as part of the Administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the
oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Any such
legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming,
and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce.
Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded
that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce
climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased
frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic
events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.

 

The adoption of
derivatives legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability
to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest
rate and other risks associated with our business.

 

Congress adopted
comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight
and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities,
including us, which participate in that market. This legislation, known as the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), became
law on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(the “CFTC”) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the
Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be
finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when
this will be accomplished. 

 

In October 2011,
the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and
option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their
economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012.
However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits
on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or
linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona
fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final,
the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. 

 

The CFTC has
designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory
clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with
covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution
requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements.
The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps,
including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although we expect
to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements
for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the
mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market
participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the
swaps that we use for hedging. If our swaps do not qualify for the commercial
end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes
prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect
of the rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain at
this time.

 

In addition,
certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing
minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify
for the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into
to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other
market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability
of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for
the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our
liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and our ability to manage
commodity price volatility and the volatility in cash flows. The impact of those
provisions is uncertain at this time.

 

The full impact of the Act and related
regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the
regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has
adjusted. The Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost
of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts,
reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or
reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative
contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and
regulations implementing the Act, our results of operations may become more
volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely
affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act
was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of commodity prices, which some
legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity
instruments related to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our revenues
could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and
implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these
consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition
and our results of operations.

The loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could
negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.

 

We
depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services
of our chief executive officer, Timothy A. Leach, and other officers and key
employees who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and
analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects,
maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and
natural gas production, and developing and executing acquisition, financing and
hedging strategies. Our ability to hire and retain our officers and key
employees is important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected loss
of the services of one or more of these individuals could negatively impact our
ability to execute our business strategy.

 

Because we do not operate and therefore control the
development of certain of the properties in which we own interests, we may not
be able to produce economic quantities of oil and natural gas in a timely
manner. 

 

At December 31, 2015, approximately 8.9 percent
of our proved reserves were attributable to properties for which we were not
the operator. As a result, the success and timing of drilling and development
activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors,
including:

 

·        
the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;

 

·        
the timing and amount of capital expenditures;

 

·        
the operators’ expertise and financial resources;

 

·        
the approval of other participants in such properties; and

 

·        
the selection and application of suitable technology.

 

If drilling and development
activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a
timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal
production declines or we will be required to write-off the reserves
attributable thereto, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and
results of operations. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our
ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities.

 

Uncertainties associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us
not realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.

 

We inject water into
formations on some of our properties to increase the production of oil and
natural gas. We may in the future expand these efforts to more of our properties
or employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional
production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery
methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods
do not allow for the extraction of oil and natural gas in a manner or to the
extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our
investments in such projects.

 

Part of our
strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion
techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.

 

Our operations
involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques. Risks
that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the
following:

 

·        
landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;

 

·        
staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally
through the formation;

 

·        
running casing the entire length of the wellbore; and

 

·        
being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through
the horizontal wellbore.

 

Risks that we face while completing
wells include, but are not limited to, the following:

 





34 








 



·        
the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;

 

·        
the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during
completion operations; and

 

·        
the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after
completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.

 

A terrorist or cyber-attack or
armed conflict could harm our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing
our costs.

 

Terrorist activities,
anti-terrorist efforts, cyber-attacks and other armed conflict involving the
United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and
could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of
these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and
societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas,
potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing
a reduction in our revenue. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be
direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely
impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production,
transportation, processing or marketing of oil and natural gas production are
destroyed or damaged. Additionally,
as an oil and natural gas producer, we may face various cybersecurity threats,
including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to
render data or systems unusable, and there can be no assurance that our
implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate
security threats will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from
occurring. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of
these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain,
if available at all.

 

Cybersecurity
breaches and information technology failures could harm our business by
increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operations. 

 

We rely
extensively on information technology systems, including Internet sites, data
hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted
by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our information
technology systems, as well as those of third parties we use in our operations,
may be vulnerable to a variety of cybersecurity risks, such as those involving
unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or
others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks and other security
issues. 

 

Although we have implemented information
technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and
prevent or minimize the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such
measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the enhanced
controls we have installed may be breached or may fail. If our information
technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached,
we could suffer disruptions to our operations and unauthorized persons may gain
access to proprietary or confidential information, which could result in loss
or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data
or confidential information; misuse or misappropriation of data, funds or other
property; and other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks.
This could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to
potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant
costs, including costs to repair or restore the security of our internal
systems or to take other remedial steps.

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock

 

Our restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law
contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals,
which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 

Our
restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to
issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors
elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party
to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of
incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be
beneficial to our stockholders, including:

 

·        
the organization of our board of directors as a classified board,
which allows no more than approximately one-third of our directors to be
elected each year;

 

·        
stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors
except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than 66 2/3 percent
of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock;

 

·        
the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; and

 

·        
limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special
meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and
nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at
meetings of stockholders.

 

Because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors
must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.

 

We do not anticipate paying
any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently
intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our
board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings,
financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and
contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other
considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained
in our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict
the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock
after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a
return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not
purchase our common stock.

 

The availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the
market price of our common stock.

 

In the future, we may issue
securities to raise cash for acquisitions. We may also acquire interests in
other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our
common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable
for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these
events may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings
per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.

 

In addition, sales of a
substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception
that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock.
This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale
of our securities.

 

The market price and trading volume of our common
stock may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.

 

The market price of our common stock may
be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading
volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause price variations to occur.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in
the future. If the market price of our common stock declines, you may be unable
to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price. Some of
the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock, or
result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock,
include:

 

·        
fluctuations
in the price of oil or natural gas;

 

·        
variations
in our quarterly operating results or failure to meet analysts’ earnings
expectations;

 





36 








 



·        
publication
of negative research reports about us or the oil and natural gas industry or
adverse publicity about the oil and natural gas industry;

 

·        
adverse
market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in
the future or actions by our stockholders;

 

·        
sales
of a large number of our common stock or the perception that such sales could
occur; 

 

·        
changes
in market valuations of similar companies;

 

·        
the
effects of government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements,
including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the export
of oil and natural gas;

 

·        
litigation
and governmental investigations; and

 

·        
general
economic and business conditions, either internationally or domestically.
