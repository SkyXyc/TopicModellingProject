 of this Report. The Global Payments Industry  We operate in the global payments industry, which consists of all forms of payment including:•Paper-based payments - cash, personal checks, money orders, official checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value; •Card-based payments - credit cards, charge cards, debit and deferred debit cards (including cash access or Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) cards), prepaid cards and other types of cards; •Contactless, mobile and web-based payments - contactless payments, electronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications, and e-commerce transactions on the Internet and through web browsers; and •Other electronic payments - wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments, among others. The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose cards, which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread use of the cards within countries, regions or around the world.  General purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked: •credit or charge cards typically access a credit account that either requires payment of the full balance within a specified period (a charge card) or that permits the cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit account (a credit card);•debit cards typically access a deposit account or other account with accessible funds maintained by the cardholder; and•prepaid cards typically access previously-funded monetary value.The primary general purpose card brands include MasterCard, Visa®, American Express®, JCB®, Diners Club®, UnionPay® and Discover®.  These brands, including MasterCard, have come to be associated with a variety of forms of payment in the United States and other markets around the world, including (depending on the brand) credit, charge, debit and prepaid cards.  Regional and domestic/local debit brands that require a personal identification number (“PIN”) for verification represent alternative, and sometimes primary, brands within many countries.  In these markets, issuers have historically relied on the Maestro and Cirrus brands (and other brands) to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions. In addition to general purpose cards, private label cards comprise a portion of all card-based forms of payment. Typically, private label cards are credit cards issued by, or on behalf of, a merchant (such as a department store or gasoline retailer) and can be used only at that merchant's locations.    Payment Services and SolutionsWe provide transaction processing and other payment-related services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design, package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers.  We work with customers to provide customized solutions, as well as more general solutions.  Our payment solutions are built upon 5Table of Contentsour expertise in payment programs, product development, payment processing technology, loyalty and rewards solutions, payment security, consulting and information services and marketing.  We also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through advertising, promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives.  Transaction Processing on the MasterCard Worldwide Network   Introduction.  We operate the MasterCard Worldwide Network, our proprietary, global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and, through them, permits MasterCard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide.  We process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers, in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories.  Typical Transaction.  A typical transaction processed over the MasterCard Worldwide Network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder, merchant, issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).  The following diagram depicts a typical point-of-interaction card transaction:In a typical transaction, a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device.  After the transaction is authorized by the issuer using our network, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below), and then posts the transaction to the cardholder's account.  The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate, as further described below), to the merchant.  The merchant discount rate, among other things, takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee.   Interchange Fees.  Interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payments system costs among the issuers and acquirers participating in our four-party payments system.  They reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay.  We do not earn revenues from interchange fees.  Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers (or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers) to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants.  In some circumstances, such as cash withdrawal transactions, this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers to acquirers.  We establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer.  We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.  Interchange fees can be a significant component of the merchant discount rate, and therefore of the costs that merchants pay to accept electronic payments.  These fees are currently subject to regulatory, legislative and/or legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions.  We are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I,  of this Report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks.  We supplement this protection with mitigation efforts to strengthen our protection against such threats, both in terms of operability of the network and protection of the information transmitted through the network.  To date, we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 99.9% of the time.  Processing Capabilities. •Transaction Switching - Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.  We provide transaction switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) through the MasterCard Worldwide Network. ◦Authorization.  Authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or others on behalf 7Table of Contentsof the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).  Our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.  ◦Clearing.  Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  We clear transactions among customers through our processing systems.  ◦Settlement.  Once transactions have been authorized and cleared, we help to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.  Once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position.  The actual exchange of funds takes place between a settlement bank, designated by the customer and approved by us, and a settlement bank chosen by us.  Customer settlement occurs generally in U.S. dollars or in a limited number of other currencies in accordance with our established rules.  •Cross-Border and Domestic Processing.  The MasterCard Worldwide Network provides our customers with a flexible structure that enables them to support processing across regions and for domestic markets.  The network processes transactions throughout the world on our products where the merchant country and issuer country are different (cross-border transactions).  We process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards and other payment devices across multiple country borders.  For example, we may process a transaction in a merchant's local currency; however, the charge for the transaction would appear on the cardholder's statement in the cardholder's home currency.  We also provide domestic (or intra-country) transaction processing services to customers in every region of the world, which allow customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants within a particular country.  We process most of the cross-border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and process the majority of MasterCard-branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and a select number of other countries.  Outside of these countries, most intra-country (as opposed to cross-border) transaction activity conducted with our payment products is authorized, cleared and/or settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of the MasterCard Worldwide Network.  We continue to invest in our network and build relationships to expand opportunities for domestic transaction processing.  In particular, the Single European Payment Area (“SEPA”) initiative creates an open and competitive market in many European countries that were previously mandated to process domestic debit transactions with domestic processors.  As a result, in addition to cross-border transactions, we now process some domestic debit transactions in virtually every SEPA country.  •Extended Processing Capabilities.  In addition to transaction switching, we continually evaluate and invest in ways to strategically extend our processing capabilities in the payments value chain by seeking to provide our customers with an expanded suite of payment processing solutions that meet the unique processing needs of their markets.  Examples include:◦MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions®. MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions (“IPS”) is a debit and prepaid issuer processing platform designed to provide medium to large global issuing customers with a complete processing solution to help create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels.  Through a single processing platform, IPS can, among other things, authorize debit and prepaid transactions, assist issuers in managing risk using fraud detection tools, manage an issuer's card base, and manage and monitor an issuer's ATMs.  The proprietary MasterCard Total Portfolio View™ tool provides a user-friendly customer interface to IPS, delivering aggregate cardholder intelligence across accounts and product lines to provide our customers with a view of information that can help them customize their products and programs.  We continue to develop opportunities to further enhance our IPS offerings and global presence.      ◦Internet Payment Gateways.  We provide e-commerce processing solutions through internet payment gateways, which are interfaces between merchants and acquirers that help move a transaction through the payments network.  Our gateways include DataCash® and MasterCard Internet Gateway Service (MiGS), which offer payment service provider solutions across the globe.  These gateways offer a single interface to provide e-commerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments and offer value-added solutions, including outsourced electronic payments, fraud prevention and alternative payment options.  ◦Strategic Investments.  We have invested strategically in various regions around the globe to pursue opportunities in issuer, prepaid, acquirer and third-party processing.  These investments support and/or provide, among other 8Table of Contentsthings, prepaid processing, acquirer processing, third-party processing services and software (as well as switching solutions) and complete processing solutions for mobile payments.  Acceptance   As of December 31, 2012, cards carrying the MasterCard logo were accepted at 35.9 million acceptance locations worldwide, including 2.1 million ATMs and 0.6 million other locations where cash may be obtained.  Information on ATM and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publicly available reports of payments industry associations, government agencies and independent market analysts.  Cards bearing the Maestro or Cirrus logos are accepted at many of these same locations.  We seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of MasterCard-branded programs by :   •Increasing the categories of merchants that accept products carrying our brands - In addition to expanding acceptance in e-commerce and mobile commerce environments, we leverage the functionality of the MasterCard Worldwide Network to expand acceptance in quick service businesses (such as fast food restaurants) and transportation (such as commuter train systems, buses and taxis) using our contactless technology, as well as public sector payments (such as those involving taxes, fees, fines and tolls), among other categories. •Increasing the number of payment channels in which MasterCard programs are accepted - We continue to introduce MasterCard acceptance in connection with bill payment. We are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories including rent, utilities and insurance with their MasterCard products. •Increasing the number of small merchants and merchants in established accepting categories who have not historically accepted MasterCard products - We enable parties like Square, iZettle, Intuit and others to provide acceptance to smaller merchants through connected devices (such as card readers), displacing cash.  Our Payment Facilitator Program was specifically designed to enable such parties.  •Increasing usage of our programs at selected merchants - We sponsor a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis.  We also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of MasterCard programs or indicating a preference for MasterCard-branded programs when accepting payments from consumers.MasterCard Programs and Solutions  Our principal payment programs and solutions, which are facilitated through our brands, include consumer credit and charge, debit, prepaid and commercial programs and solutions and emerging payments solutions (including digital and mobile money platforms).  Our issuer customers determine the competitive features for the cards and other products issued under our programs, including interest rates and fees.  We determine other aspects of our programs, such as required services and the marketing strategy, in order to help ensure consistency.Consumer Credit and Charge.  We offer a number of consumer credit and charge programs that are designed to meet the needs of our customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our consumer credit and charge programs generated $1.8 trillion in GDV globally, representing 50% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard logo appeared on 686 million consumer credit and charge cards worldwide, representing a 5% increase from December 31, 2011.  We offer customized programs around the world to address specific consumer segments.  Our consumer credit programs include:•Standard  - general purpose products targeted to entry level consumers with basic credit card needs.  Standard products provide payment solutions featuring revolving credit, security and everyday convenience. •Premium - products designed for emerging affluent consumers and featuring higher credit lines and spending limits and a varying level of enhanced services, including insurance coverage and access benefits.  •Affluent - product offerings which feature our highest purchasing capacity, as well as a comprehensive range of premium access benefits and top-tier services, and travel, concierge and cardholder protection insurances in some regions.  These products are specifically designed to target the needs of the most affluent segments worldwide.  9Table of ContentsDebit.  We support a range of payment solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit accounts and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs may have the MasterCard, Maestro and/or Cirrus logos, and can be used to obtain cash in bank branches or at ATMs.  In addition, MasterCard and Maestro-branded debit products may be used to make purchases and, in some cases, to obtain cash back at the point of sale.  •MasterCard-branded Debit Card. MasterCard-branded debit programs provide functionality for both signature-based and PIN-based authenticated transactions.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our MasterCard-branded debit programs generated $1.5 trillion in GDV globally, representing 42% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard logo appeared on 436 million debit cards worldwide, representing 21% growth from December 31, 2011. •Maestro-branded Debit Card. Maestro is our global PIN-based debit program, and is the only PIN-based solution that operates globally.  As of December 31, 2012, the Maestro logo appeared on 743 million cards worldwide, representing 4% growth from December 31, 2011.  Maestro has a leading position among PIN-based debit brands in many markets throughout the world, particularly in Europe.  The strong presence of Maestro in Europe positions us well as the SEPA initiative creates a more open and competitive payments market in many European countries that had been previously mandated to process domestic debit transactions with domestic processors.  The global acceptance of Maestro contributes to the growth of our debit business and adds value to the services that we provide to our customers. •MasterCard Global ATM Solutions. Cirrus is our primary global cash access brand.  MasterCard Global ATM Solutions provides domestic (in-country) and cross-border access for varied types of transactions, including cash withdrawal (deposit accounts), cash advance (credit accounts), cash drawdown (prepaid accounts), balance inquiries, account transfers and deposits at ATMs that participate in the MasterCard Worldwide Network.  Prepaid.  Prepaid programs involve a balance that is funded with monetary value prior to use. Cardholders access funds via a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled payment card or other device (such as mobile) that may leverage our contactless functionality.  MasterCard customers may implement prepaid payment programs using any of our brands.  We provide processing services (including transaction switching) in support of either magnetic stripe or chip-enabled prepaid programs.  We provide and customize programs to meet unique commercial and consumer needs in all prepaid segments, including programs such as general purpose reloadable, employee benefit, payroll, travel, incentive, government disbursement programs and gift cards.  In particular, we focus on three categories: •government, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in government programs such as Social Security payments, unemployment benefits and others;•commercial, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in business applications such as payroll, health savings accounts and others; and •consumer reloadable, which includes programs to address the payment needs of individuals without formal banking relationships, individuals who are not traditional users of credit or debit cards or devices or individuals who want to segment funds for security or convenience purposes, such as travel.  We also provide prepaid card program management services through Access Prepaid Worldwide (“Access”).  Through Access, we manage and deliver consumer and commercial prepaid travel cards to business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus.  Combined with MasterCard's processing assets (such as IPS) and other strategic alliances, these services augment and support issuers of prepaid cards around the world, with a focus outside of the United States.  Access enables us to offer end-to-end prepaid solutions encompassing branded switching, issuer processing and program management services, primarily focused on the travel sector. Commercial.  We offer commercial payment solutions that help large corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and government entities to streamline their procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses and reduce administrative costs.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our commercial credit and charge programs generated $287 billion in GDV globally, representing 8% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard brand mark appeared on 36 million commercial credit and charge cards worldwide, representing an 8% increase from December 31, 2011.  We offer various commercial payment programs and value-added services, including corporate cards, corporate premium cards, corporate purchasing cards and fleet cards (as well as the MasterCard Corporate Multi Card®, which combines the functionality of one or more of these cards) that allow corporations to, among other things, manage travel and entertainment expenses, streamline the procurement process and provide corporations with additional transactional detail.  Among the platforms we provide is SmartData, 10Table of Contentsa MasterCard-powered tool which provides information reporting and expense management capabilities.  We also offer government entities a variety of payment programs that are similar to the procurement, travel, purchasing, fleet and Multi Card programs offered to corporations.  Credit and debit programs targeted at the small-business segment offer business owners the ability to gain access to working capital, to extend payments and to separate business expenses from personal expenses. Emerging Payments and Innovation.  We focus on innovation to enhance our current programs and extend our products and services to customers (including merchants, telecommunications companies and government entities) and into new geographies.  We have a global innovation group, MasterCard Labs, which is dedicated to developing new and innovative products and solutions for our customers and our cardholders.  This group incubates new product concepts, builds prototypes, runs pilots and is designed for a rapid evaluation process.  We offer innovative platforms, services and technologies aligned around the following strategic areas:  •Digital Infrastructure.  The continued adoption of connected devices (such as mobile smartphones, PCs, and tablet devices) has resulted in the ongoing convergence of the physical and digital worlds, where consumers are increasingly transacting across a range of connected devices in a variety of contexts - in-store, online and on tablets and mobile devices.  To support this convergence, we have developed a digital platform that is designed to allow customers, merchants and others to provide a consistent, fast and secure shopping experience for consumers, whether at a register, or on a PC, tablet or mobile device.  The platform is also focused on generating more value and increased sales for merchants (including building preference and loyalty), and delivering new revenue streams and competitive advantages for MasterCard and our customers.  We also work with strategic partners to enable consumers to securely use their smartphones to make contactless payments and obtain other related services.  We have worked with multiple customers globally to launch digital wallet solutions powered by our mobile contactless technology.  In addition, we are supporting the pilot launch of ISIS (a joint venture formed in the United States by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile).  Also, in December 2012, we made a minority investment in C-SAM, a global mobile wallet software provider.  •Mobile Money Infrastructure.  We provide a platform and various services to customers and other parties to enable consumers to pay from any type of mobile phone (and in particular, feature phones).  These services include linking mobile accounts to virtual MasterCard account numbers, allowing subscribers (many of whom do not have traditional payment cards) to shop online, enabling person-to-person transfers (including our money transfer solution, MasterCard MoneySend®) on behalf of our customers for consumers using mobile devices, and enabling mobile subscribers to send payments to handsets of merchants who otherwise do not accept electronic payments.  Mobile Money services are provided through the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway, operated through our Mobile Payments Solutions joint venture with Smart Hub.  The gateway is a turnkey mobile payment processing platform that facilitates transaction routing and prepaid processing for mobile-initiated transactions for our customers.  In addition, we continue to commercialize our two joint ventures with Telefonica to provide consumers with mobile payments services in multiple countries across Latin America.  •Chip and Contactless Solutions.  We continue to work with our customers around the world to help them replace their traditional magnetic-stripe based cards and terminals with new chip-enabled products that offer increased security and fraud protection as well as opportunities for new functions and value-added services. ◦EMV Chip Development and Solutions.  Our chip solutions are developed in accordance with the EMV standard (the international standard for chip technology); we play a leading role in the evolution of the standard via our role as part owner of, and a key contributor to, EMVCo (the industry governing body of the EMV specifications).   As we broaden our chip technology deployments into new markets, we remain focused on maintaining global interoperability (a key feature of the MasterCard brand), reducing potential fraud and increasing security.   Customers in all regions are actively progressing chip programs with significant numbers of new cards and terminals being deployed.   In January 2012, we endorsed EMV as the payments platform technology for the U.S. market and are now engaged at all levels in the industry to bring the benefits of this technology to our U.S. customers and consumers.◦Contactless Payment Solutions.  We leverage the chip platform to drive new, scalable consumer experiences and business opportunities for our customers.  In particular, our chip technology facilitates both contactless and mobile payments, which both enable consumers and merchants to transact in new ways leveraging our chip-enabled acceptance and network infrastructure.   MasterCard PayPass®, our contactless payment solution, utilizes radio frequency, or near-field communication (NFC) technology, to securely transmit payment details wirelessly from payment devices to PayPass-branded contactless-enabled payment terminals for processing through the MasterCard Worldwide Network. This technology enables consumers simply to tap their payment card or other payment device, such as a key fob, wristband or tag that adheres 11Table of Contentsto the back of a mobile device, on a PayPass-enabled terminal to complete a transaction. Our mobile contactless payment solution, MasterCard Mobile PayPass, has been designed to enable consumers to use their mobile devices in a similar way by integrating the necessary hardware and software into the mobile device itself. Our PayPass program primarily targets everyday purchases that rely on speed and convenience (such as supermarkets, fast food restaurants, parking and transit). As of December 31, 2012, PayPass programs had rolled out in nearly 50 countries worldwide. Value-Added Services and Solutions  We offer a variety of services and solutions across our business, designed to support and enhance our programs and solutions:MasterCard Advisors.  MasterCard Advisors is our global professional services group which provides proprietary analysis, data-driven consulting and marketing services solutions to help clients optimize, streamline and grow their businesses.  It differentiates us from our competitors by transforming data we collect into actionable insights for our customers and other clients.  We provide services based on this data through three business lines: Information Services, Consulting Services, and Managed Services.  Information Services provides a suite of data analytics and products (including reports, benchmarks, models and forecasts) to a diversified customer base, enabling them to make better business decisions.  Consulting Services combines professional problem-solving skills with payments expertise to provide solutions that address the challenges and opportunities of customers with respect to their payments business, and help to maximize the value of that business. Managed Services provides executional and turnkey solutions via data-driven acquisition of accounts, activation of portfolios, conversion of cards, marketing promotions activities and other customer management services.  We charge customers and other clients fees for these professional services, which often add value to our other products. Authorization, Routing and Alert Controls.  MasterCard inControl® is an innovative platform featuring an array of advanced authorization, transaction routing and alert controls and virtual card number capabilities that uses the functionality of the MasterCard Worldwide Network and is designed to assist financial institutions in creating new and enhanced payment offerings.  Fraud Prevention and Detection Services.  We offer several fraud detection and prevention solutions focused on enhancing safety for consumers.  These solutions include MasterCard Expert Monitoring Solutions®, a comprehensive suite of services designed to help our customers detect and prevent fraudulent activity, and DataCash fraud prevention tools for e-commerce merchants.Loyalty and Rewards Solutions.  We focus on providing value for consumers on MasterCard payment cards and devices through a combination of benefits and services both paid for and arranged by MasterCard on behalf of our customers.  We work together with issuers, merchants and other customers to help them increase the value they provide to consumers by providing scalable technology platforms and supporting them with program management capability.  In doing so, we provide issuers and merchants with services across all types of payment cards and devices, while providing additional value to cardholders. Our suite of services for issuers include a scalable rewards platform that enables issuers to provide their consumers with personalized offers and rewards, access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, a wide range of individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center to provide information related to benefits and rewards programs.  Our suite of services for merchants include a targeted offers and rewards campaign management service for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of a co-brand or merchants loyalty card or a member of a third-party-managed rewards program to obtain reward points faster.Marketing   We manage and promote our brands through advertising, promotions, sponsorships and digital, mobile and social media initiatives.  These efforts support our strategic vision of an environment where electronic payment is the predominant form of payment.  Our marketing activities combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, digital, mobile and social media, public relations and issuer and merchant engagement as part of an integrated program designed to increase consumer preference for our brands and usage of our products.  We also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries.  Our initiatives are designed to build the value of the MasterCard brand and enhance stockholder value.  Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among cardholders globally.  Our award-winning “Priceless®” advertising campaign has run in 53 languages in 112 countries worldwide.  The “Priceless” campaign promotes MasterCard usage benefits and acceptance that permit cardholders to pay for what they need, when they need it as well as marketing MasterCard credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions.  It also provides MasterCard 12Table of Contentswith a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe.  We continue to refine our consumer marketing approach, including by placing greater strategic focus on consumers' spending preferences.  For example, Priceless Cities® is a global program intended to increase preference for the MasterCard brand by connecting consumers to their interests by offering them access to special experiences and offers when they are at home or traveling. MasterCard launched Priceless Cities in 2011 in three cities - New York, London and Toronto - and in 2012 the program was extended to include more than 20 cities across all of our regions.  We continue to support our brand by using digital, mobile and social channels to allow us to engage more directly with our stakeholders and allow consumers and customers to engage directly in programs, promotions and merchant offers, as well as provide relevant information on MasterCard products, services and tools.  MasterCard has also introduced both global and region-specific smart phone applications, including MasterCard's ATM Hunter®, MasterCard Easy Savings®, PayPass Locator, MCompass, and Budget Pilot that provide consumers with on-the-go utility. MasterCard continues to use digital and mobile channels and social media to develop preference and usage with consumers and more effectively partner with customers and merchants to help them drive their respective businesses.  For example, we have used Facebook to run our Priceless music programs which offer music benefits and music mobile applications to MasterCard cardholders in Australia and Mexico.  We also seek to deliver value to customers and consumers through the sponsorship of a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties.  We have partnerships with Major League Baseball, the PGA Tour, the Union of European Football Association Champions League, the Walt Disney Company in Europe, The Grammy Awards and The Brit Awards.  In 2012, we continued and expanded our partnership with Stand Up to Cancer, which ties MasterCard cardholder use of MasterCard cards and other payment devices in restaurants and online to our donations to cancer research.  We also entered into a sponsorship partnership in 2012 with the Brazilian Football Confederation, Brazil's national football team.  Also in 2012, we entered into a sponsorship partnership with Sonoma State University in Northern California to sponsor its new performing arts center.  Our approach to sponsorship assets aligns with consumer segments important to us and our customers.  Customer and Stakeholder Relationship Management  We are committed to providing issuers and acquirers, merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and other parties that play a role in the payments industry with coordinated services that leverage our expertise in payment programs, product development, technology, processing, consulting and information services and marketing.  We manage our relationships with our customers and other parties (including processors and other third parties) on a global and regional basis, to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into our product, brand, processing, technology and related strategies, and to ensure we provide value to them.  Issuers and Acquirers.  In addition to the many ways described above that we provide value to issuers and acquirers, we enter into business agreements which provide customers with financial incentives and other support benefits to issue, accept, route, prioritize and promote our branded products and other payment programs.  These financial incentives may be based on GDV or other performance-based criteria, such as issuance of new payment products, increased acceptance of our products, launch of new programs or execution of marketing initiatives.  We believe that our business agreements with these customers have contributed to our volume and revenue growth in recent years.  Merchants.  Merchants are an important constituency in the MasterCard payments system and we are working to further develop and enhance our relationships with them, and provide value to merchants of all sizes.  Our core programs enable merchants to receive secure and timely payments from cardholders across the globe.  We provide merchants with solutions that help to increase revenues, enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies and address fraud.  For example, we provide merchants the opportunity to increase revenue through the suite of information, consulting and managed services offered by MasterCard Advisors, which can help them understand specific activity in their industry, evaluate their sales performance against competitors and focus direct marketing efforts.  We enable merchants to build a recurring relationship with their customers through products and solutions such as reloadable prepaid solutions, as well as, in some circumstances, licensing them directly as issuers.  Through our Priceless Cities platform, we work with merchants to build consumer affection and deepen their existing customer relationships.  In terms of enabling new sales channels, we give merchants a way to accept payments through channels like mobile, and help merchants create better purchase experiences through platforms such as our digital platform supporting payments in-store, online and on tablets and mobile devices.  We can also help merchants improve efficiencies with solutions such as our contactless technology and our internet payment gateways.  Merchants can address fraud concerns with fraud detection and prevention solutions like our Expert Monitoring System.  Finally, we provide merchant forums and anti-piracy programs to inform, educate and share information with merchants on topics that are relevant to them such as fraud.Despite these opportunities, we also face challenges in our relationships with merchants.  We believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope.  These merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including MasterCard.  In particular, large merchants have supported 13Table of Contentsmany of the litigation, legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that MasterCard and others in the industry have been defending against.  This includes the U.S. merchant litigations as to which the Company recently entered into a settlement agreement (subject to final court approval).  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I,  of this Report related to cross-border travel.In 2012, net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately $1.8 billion, or 24% of our total revenue.  No single customer generated greater than 10% of total revenue. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenues” in Part II, Item 7 for more detail.GDV and Processed Transactions The tables below provide information regarding two key drivers of our revenue:  (1) GDV, which forms the basis of volume-based revenues, and (2) processed transactions.  GDV. The GDV table below provides information regarding the GDV for all MasterCard-branded cards (excluding Cirrus and Maestro) and for both MasterCard credit and charge programs and MasterCard debit and prepaid programs in all of our  regions for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.  Growth rates are provided on both a U.S. dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated.  GDV represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks.

The table below sets forth the total number of transactions processed by MasterCard for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:  Year ended December 31, 2012 Year-over-year growth Year ended December 31, 2011  (in millions, except percentages)Processed Transactions 34,156 25% 27,265Participation Standards   We establish and enforce our standards surrounding participation in MasterCard and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands.  Rulemaking and Application of StandardsParticipation in the MasterCard payments network is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers.  Applicants for participation must meet specified requirements.  In general, we grant licenses by territory to applicants that meet those specified criteria.  Licenses provide customers with certain rights, including access to the network and usage of our brands. Anti-money laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new customers prior to issuing a license and existing customers are evaluated applying a risk-based approach.  All customers must meet the requirements of our anti-money laundering program, and we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation for non-compliance with the program.  As a condition of our licenses, customers agree to comply with our standards, which include requirements in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, policies, rules and operating regulations and procedures.  MasterCard and certain of our affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and apply our standards, which relate to topics such as participation eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the use of our trademarks; merchant acquiring activities (including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and guaranteed settlement and customer failures. Customer Risk ManagementWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network ("settlement exposure").  We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer, or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder balances held by the issuer.  As a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers, we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, and affiliate debit licensees.  Our gross settlement exposure for MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded transactions, which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, was approximately $38 billion as of December 31, 2012.  Principal customers participate directly in MasterCard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers. To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations, we monitor the financial health of, economic and political operating environments of, and compliance with our standards by, our principal customers, affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses.  If the financial condition of a customer or the state of the economy or political environment in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to our customers, or its payment obligations to MasterCard merchants, or its obligations to safeguard funds for prepaid cardholders, we may require the customer to make operational changes and/or post collateral.  This collateral is typically in the form of a standby letter of credit, a bank guarantee or a secured cash account and is required to mitigate our exposure.  As of December 31, 2012, we had customers who had posted approximately $3.8 billion in collateral held for settlement exposure.  If a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other customers, we are able to draw upon such customer's collateral, if provided, in order to minimize any potential loss to ourselves or our customers. In addition to obtaining collateral from customers, in situations where a customer is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other customers, we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation in our network.  Additionally, and to further preserve payment system integrity, we reserve the right to terminate a customer's right to participate in our network if, for example, the customer fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business, or if a liquidating agent, conservator or receiver is appointed for the customer or the customer is insolvent.  In addition to these measures, we have also established a $3 billion committed credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including to provide liquidity in the event of customer settlement failure.  See our risk 16Table of Contentsfactor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I,  of this Report related to account data breaches.  Fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present, such as e-commerce, mobile commerce, mail order and telephone order transactions. Security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce, where a signed cardholder sales receipt, verification through use of a PIN or the presence of the card or payment device (along with the embedded security features) or merchant agent is unavailable.We monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity.  We also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents.  Key compliance programs include merchant audits (for high fraud, excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions) and security compliance (including our MasterCard Site Data Protection Service®, which assists customers, merchants and third-party service providers in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises) by requiring proper adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and other PCI standards designed to secure payment application and terminals.  Our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate.Our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the products they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions.  However, we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of MasterCard products.  We provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud and ensure safety, including:•MasterCard SecureCode®, a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique, personal code; •Our Site Data Protection program to advance adherence to the PCI DSS and other PCI standards;  •Our Global Vendor Certification Program (GVCP) to ensure card manufacturers comply with MasterCard-defined physical and logistical security requirements;•Our Compliance Assessment and Security Testing (CAST) Program to ensure integrated circuit card and secure elements used in smart cards and mobile payment devices are evaluated against known and state of the art attack scenarios; and•Fraud detection and prevention solutions, including our suite of fraud management products and services, Expert Monitoring Solutions, and DataCash fraud prevention tools for e-commerce merchants.  Enterprise Risk Management   We face a number of risks in operating our business (for a description of material risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I,  related to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries.   •Particular Segments.  We face competition with respect to particular segments of the payments industry, including:  ◦Debit.  We encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from ATM and point-of-sale debit networks in various countries, such as Interlink, Plus and Visa Electron (owned by Visa Inc.), Star® (owned by First Data Corporation), NYCE® (owned by FIS), and Pulse® (owned by Discover), in the United States; Interac in Canada; EFTPOS in Australia; and Bankserv in South Africa.  In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main brands while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions, which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume.  ◦PIN-Based Debit Transactions.   Our business and revenues could be adversely impacted in the United States by a tendency among U.S. merchants to migrate from signature-based debit transactions to PIN-based debit transactions because we generally earn less revenue from PIN-based debit transactions.  In addition, Visa's competitive response to the limitations presented in the United States by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") could potentially reduce our PIN debit volumes.  ◦Private-Label.  Private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other types of merchants, also serve as another form of competition.  •End-to-End Payments Networks.  Our competitors include operators of proprietary end-to-end payments networks, such as American Express and Discover, that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships 18Table of Contentswith cardholders.  These competitors have certain competitive advantages over four-party payments systems such as ours.  Among other things, because these competitors provide an end-to-end service, they do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs between the issuing and acquiring sides of their business, even though they have the ability to internally transfer costs in a manner similar to interchange fees.  As a result, to date, operators of end-to-end payments networks have generally avoided the same regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation challenges we face.  •Competition for Customer Business.  We compete intensely with other payments networks for customer business.  Globally, financial institutions typically issue both MasterCard and Visa-branded payment cards, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs.  In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system.  We also compete for new business partners with whom we seek to work, such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunication companies.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I,  related to the increasingly intense competitive pressure we face on the prices we charge our customers.  •Banking Industry Consolidation.  The banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation over the last several years, and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future.  Consolidations have included customers with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.  Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a substantial loss of business for us.  The continued consolidation in the banking industry, whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial MasterCard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship, would also produce a smaller number of large customers, which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with us. Consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms.  This pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I,  of this Report. Interchange Fees.  Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world.  Examples include:•legislation, including resulting regulations (such as regulations implemented in October 2011 by the Federal Reserve in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, which set limits on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees”); •competition-related regulatory proceedings (such as the European Commission's December 2007 decision restricting our cross-border interchange fees, which is pending appeal, as well as proceedings in several jurisdictions, including Canada and European Union member states); •central bank regulation (such as in Australia); and•litigation (such as the merchant litigations in the United States and private lawsuits in Canada and the United Kingdom).  For more detail, see our risk factors in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I,  of this Report related to regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security.  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism.  MasterCard and other participants in the payments industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which  requires us to maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering (“AML”) program and imposes similar requirements on our financial institution customers in the United States.  We are subject to the AML laws and regulations of India and the activities of our internet payments gateway and prepaid card program management services are also subject to U.S. and other countries' AML laws and regulations.  We have an AML compliance program to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  The program is comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer and providing for the training of appropriate personnel regarding AML responsibilities.   We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) restricting financial transactions and other dealings with Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan and with persons and entities included in OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”).  Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states.  We have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license financial institutions domiciled in these countries.  We have established a risk-based compliance program that includes policies, procedures and controls that are designed to protect us against having business dealings with prohibited countries, individuals or entities.  We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC sanctions, including obligating our customers to screen cardholders and merchants against the SDN List; however, it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payments system and that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions' association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions.  Financial Industry Regulation.  We are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers.  Certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) under its authority to examine financial institutions' technology service providers.  Examinations by the FFIEC cover areas such as data integrity and data security.  Additionally, in July 2010, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) was created.  The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products.  It is not entirely clear whether and/or to what extent the CFPB will regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) in order to identify risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure of, or ongoing activities by, large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies.  Among other responsibilities, the FSOC is tasked with identifying payment, clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, such systems will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements.  To date, MasterCard has not been designated “systemically important.”  However, the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on MasterCard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I,  related to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments or processing services in certain countries.  Issuer Practice Regulation.  Our customers are subject to numerous regulations and legislation applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere in their capacity as issuers and otherwise, and as a consequence MasterCard is impacted by such regulations.  For example, in the United States in 2009, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations addressing overdraft fees imposed in connection with ATM and debit card transactions.  Additionally, the CFPB launched an investigation into bank overdraft practices in 2012, and it remains to be seen whether the CFPB investigation will result in further regulation in this area.  Any new regulation in this area may further restrict the ability of our customers to charge overdraft fees in connection with debit programs, which may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues.  Additionally, regulation of issuer practices around the world include regulation of the issuance of prepaid cards.  In Germany, additional consumer information is required in connection with prepaid transactions, which could restrict the issuance of prepaid cards.  In India, prepaid cards not associated with a bank cannot be issued.  Any similar regulation restricting issuance of prepaid cards and devices could directly impact our business and our volumes.  Regulation of Internet Transactions.  In October 2006, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions.  The legislation applies to payments system participants, including MasterCard and our U.S. customers, and is implemented through a federal regulation.  The federal law requires us and our customers to implement compliance programs.  Also, Congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate Internet gambling that could increase our costs and/or could decrease our transaction volumes.  In addition, the U.S. Congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our customers.  Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation.  If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes.  Additional Regulatory Developments.  Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.  New requirements and developments may affect our customers' ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes.  In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers' ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as premium and prepaid cards, which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth.

We consider our relationship with employees to be good. Additional InformationMasterCard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware stock corporation in May 2001.  We conduct our business principally through MasterCard Incorporated's principal operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”), a Delaware non-stock (or membership) corporation that was formed in November 1966.  In May 2006, we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for MasterCard Incorporated (including an initial public offering of a new class of common stock (the “IPO”)) which included the appointment of a new Board of Directors which is comprised almost entirely of directors who are independent from our customers.  For more information about our capital structure, including our Class A common stock (our voting stock) and Class B common stock (our non-voting stock), see Note 13 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.Website and SEC Reports The Company's internet address is www.mastercard.com.  From time to time, we may use our website as a channel of distribution of material company information.  Financial and other material information is routinely posted and accessible on the investor relations section of our corporate website.  In addition, you may automatically receive e-mail alerts and other information about MasterCard by enrolling your e-mail address by visiting “E-Mail Alerts” in the investor relations section of our corporate website.

The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report. with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act for more detail.    •In the European Union, in January 2012, the European Commission issued a “Green-Paper” (typically the first step in the European legislative process) identifying a number of concerns with the payments industry, including concerns about interchange fees. In October 2012, the European Commission announced that it intends to propose legislation in the second quarter of 2013 regulating interchange fees and covering other elements included within the Green Paper. 23Table of Contents•In Poland, in 2012, the Polish parliament began drafting legislation that would mandate a significant reduction in interchange fees and limit our ability to enforce our “honor all cards” rule. Examples of competition-related regulatory proceedings or inquiries around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include:  •In the European Union, in December 2007, the European Commission issued a negative decision (upheld by a judgment of the General Court of the European Union, which we are appealing) with respect to our cross-border interchange fees for consumer credit and debit cards under European Union competition rules.  •In Canada, in December 2010, the Canadian Competition Bureau filed an application with the Canadian Competition Tribunal to strike down rules related to MasterCard's interchange fees, including its “honor all cards”, “no surcharge” and non-discrimination rules.•In France, in January 2013, the French Competition Authority re-opened an investigation concerning our domestic interchange rates and informed us it intends to commence a formal proceeding and issue a statement of objections unless we offer commitments to reduce our interchange fees.•In Hungary, MasterCard Europe is appealing the Hungarian Competition Office December 2009 decision ruling that MasterCard Europe's historic domestic interchange fees violate Hungarian competition law and fining MasterCard Europe approximately $3 million.  The appeal has been stayed pending the outcome of our appeal of the European Commission decision.  Additionally, in 2012, the Hungarian Competition Office began an investigation into whether MasterCard is dominant in Hungary's payments industry and whether we abused that dominance in setting our interchange fees.   •In the United Kingdom, in February 2007, the Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") commenced a new investigation of MasterCard Europe's U.K. interchange fees, following the voiding by the Competition Appeals Tribunal of the OFT's 2006 decision that our previous domestic interchange fees violated U.K. and European Union competition law.  The OFT has suspended its investigation pending the outcome of our appeal of the European Commission decision.  Examples of regulation, or potential regulation, by central banks and similar types of regulatory authorities around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include: •In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia enacted regulations in 2002 (which have been subsequently reviewed and not withdrawn) controlling the costs that can be considered in setting interchange fees for four-party payment card systems such as ours and capping the average of such interchange fees. •In South Africa, in September 2010, the South African Reserve Bank commenced a process (including the  appointment of an independent consultant) to determine the manner in which interchange fees for all payments systems in South Africa should be set.  •In Canada, there has been increasing attention by policymakers on payments, and specifically the cost of acceptance, which includes interchange fees.  In 2010, the Canadian Department of Finance implemented a voluntary “Code of Conduct” on related issues for payment card industry participants in Canada, by which MasterCard voluntarily agreed to abide.  In 2011, the Minister of Finance formed a task force to make non-binding recommendations with respect to the future of Canadian payments, including a focus on the cost of acceptance.  The task force issued its final report in March 2012.  In response, the Minister of Finance is considering revising the Code of Conduct to specifically address mobile payments, forming an advisory committee to advise his office on matters of payments policy, and evaluating whether and to what extent the domestic payments system governance framework should be revised.  •In Brazil, in December 2011, the Central Bank of Brazil (together with competition agencies in Brazil) issued a follow-up to its May 2010 report, providing an analysis of the evolution of the payments industry. The report includes indications that it is closely monitoring trends with respect to interchange fees and the cost of acceptance in general, and raises questions about the impact of the no-surcharge rule in the Brazilian consumer protection code.See Note 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees.  We believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on interchange matters and, as a result, developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators' approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in this Part I,  with respect to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide.  Issuers are required to file various types of information regarding debit and prepaid transactions with the Federal Reserve every two years beginning in 2013, and such information could be used by the Federal Reserve to reexamine and potentially re-set the interchange cap.  With respect to network arrangements and transaction routing, the regulations require debit and prepaid cards to be enabled with two unaffiliated payments networks.  The regulations also provide that an issuer or payments network may not inhibit the ability of any person that accepts or honors a debit or prepaid card to direct the routing of the card transaction for processing over any network enabled on the card.  25Table of ContentsThe Dodd-Frank Act also created two new independent regulatory bodies - the CFPB and FSOC.  The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products.  It is not yet entirely clear whether and/or to what extent the CFPB will regulate broader aspects of payments network operations.  The FSOC is tasked, among other responsibilities, with identifying “systemically important” payment, clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements.  To date, MasterCard has not been designated “systemically important” under the applicable standard.  If MasterCard were designated “systemically important,” it would be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment, clearing and settlement activities.  New regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures; collateral requirements; participant default policies and procedures; the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions; and capital and financial resource requirements.  Also, a “systemically important” payments system could be required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve or another federal agency for changes to its system rules, procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payments system.  These developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make electronic payment transactions less attractive to card issuers, as well as consumers.  This could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues. If issuers, acquirers and/or merchants modify their business operations or otherwise take actions in response to this legislation which have the result of reducing the number of debit or prepaid transactions we process or the network fees we collect, the Dodd-Frank Act could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.  Failure by our customers or us to adjust our strategies successfully to compete in the new environment would increase this impact. We recently entered into an agreement to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation that, among other things, requires us to not restrict U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, from surcharging credit card transactions, which could impact the use of electronic payments and result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and could in turn materially and adversely impact our results of operations.  We have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain regions, including the United States, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using MasterCard products instead of other means.  As part of the terms of the settlement of the U.S. merchant class litigation entered into by the Company in October 2012 (and subject to final court approval), the Company and Visa have modified their no-surcharge or comparable rules to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations (including ensuring that MasterCard or Visa cardholders are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as American Express, Discover and PayPal, should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging).  It is possible that over time U.S. merchants in some or all merchant categories may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change, which could make credit card programs less desirable to consumers in the United States.  In the event that such merchants surcharge credit cards, this could result in consumers having a less favorable view of our products and/or using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.  New regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity with respect to the payments industry in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations (or impact pending regulatory proceedings) in other jurisdictions or of other products.  Regulators around the world increasingly look at each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries, states or regions. For example, the December 2007 European Commission decision with respect to cross-border interchange fees could also lead to additional competition authorities in European member states commencing investigations or proceedings regarding domestic interchange fees or initiating regulation.  The General Court's judgment in May 2012 upholding the European Commission's decision has increased the possibility of such actions, as well as the possibility of an adverse outcome for us in related and pending matters.  Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product.  For example, regulations affecting debit transactions (such as the Federal Reserve's final rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act) could lead to regulation of other consumer products (including credit).  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in this Part I, , with respect to government actions which may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries.   •Issuer Practice Legislation and Regulation - Our financial institution customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to issuers and more generally to banks and other financial institutions, which impact us as a consequence. Examples include the Federal Reserve regulations in the United States addressing any overdraft fees imposed in connection with ATM and debit card transactions, the CFPB's investigation into bank overdraft practices (and any further potential litigation on this) and regulations instituted in Germany requiring the provision of certain consumer identification information in connection with prepaid transactions (with similar legislation being considered in other jurisdictions).  These regulations may diminish the attractiveness of our products to our customers.   •Regulation of Internet Transactions - Regulation of Internet transactions such as Internet gambling transactions and prescription drug practices can impact our customers and MasterCard as a payments system operator.   27Table of ContentsIncreased regulatory focus on us, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may result in costly compliance burdens and/or may otherwise increase our costs, which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.  Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, which could reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance.  Finally, failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.   Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security could decrease the number of payment cards and devices issued and could increase our costs. We are subject to regulations related to privacy and data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations.  Recently, these topics have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in jurisdictions around the world, in particular in Europe, where the European Directive 95/46/EC is in the process of being revised.  Regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may raise concerns and scrutiny of our practices in regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information.  Failure to comply with the privacy and data protection and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.  Any additional, or changes to, regulations in these areas (as well as the manner in which such laws could be interpreted or applied) may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations.  Changes to these laws could also impact our business operations by requiring changes to our data practices and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring and the development of information-based products and solutions.  In addition, these regulations may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue.  Any of these changes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. Liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  We are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law.  See Note 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings.  Except as otherwise discussed in Note 18, we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges, if any, that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future.  In the event we are found liable in any of these material litigations or proceedings, particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable, we could be subject to significant damages, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation.  For example, as described above, as part of the terms of the settlement of the U.S. merchant class litigation entered into by the Company in October 2012 (and subject to final court approval), the Company and Visa modified their no-surcharge rules in January 2013 to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations (including ensuring that MasterCard or Visa cardholders are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as American Express, Discover and PayPal, should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging).  Any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.  Potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments.  Potential changes in existing tax laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the United States, including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations, may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments.  This could adversely impact our results of operations.  See also Note 17 (Income Tax) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.  28Table of ContentsBusiness Risks Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.  The global payments industry is highly competitive.  Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks); card-based or other electronic payment programs or systems, including credit, charge, debit, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited use programs; contactless, mobile and web-based payment platforms; and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House payments.  Within the global general purpose payments industry, we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as Visa, American Express, Discover, UnionPay, JCB and PayPal among others.  Visa has greater volume than we do, and has greater scale and market share, as well as strong brand recognition, which may provide significant competitive advantages.  Moreover, some of our traditional competitors, as well as alternative payment service providers, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have.  Our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank activity and legislative activity.   Certain of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternative payments systems, operate end-to-end payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers.  These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models.  For example, operators of end-to-end payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of four-party payments systems such as ours, in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers.  In addition, even when they operate programs that utilize a four-party system, these competitors have not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of four-party payments systems such as ours.  If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors.  Certain competitors may also hold competitive advantages as a result of their organizational structures.  See “Business-Competition” in Part I, Item 1.   If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats.  Our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth.  Our customers can also develop their own competitive services.  We also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices, as well as physical store locations.  A number of these new entrants rely principally on the Internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Potential future changes in the competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain, also could harm our business. We also expect that there may be other changes in the competitive landscape in the future, including:  •Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process.  For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers.  Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases processing the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.  •Rapid and significant technological changes could occur, resulting in new and innovative payment programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of MasterCard products. •Competitors, customers, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added services we currently provide to support our transaction processing which could, if significant numbers of cardholders choose to use them, replace our own processing services or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these services. •Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services. 29Table of ContentsOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands.  In order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our card base, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our products.  In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts.  Over the past several years, we have experienced continued pricing pressure.  The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth.  We may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.  In addition, increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.  We may not succeed in these efforts.   In the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry.  Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers.  In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment.  Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability.  Furthermore, a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors.  In addition, customers principally aligned with one of our competitors may outperform customers principally aligned with us.  A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.   Additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for us and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.  The banking industry has undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past, and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future.  Consolidations have included customers with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.  Significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects.  In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business.  Consolidation in the banking industry, whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial MasterCard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship, would also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase the bargaining power of our customers.  This consolidation could lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers.  Any such lower prices and/or more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  If we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers, our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term, which could have a material adverse long-term impact on our business.   Most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers.  Our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop their own competitive services.  Accordingly, our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers.  In 2012, the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately $1.8 billion, or 24%, of total revenue.  Loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.  30Table of ContentsMerchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting electronic forms of payment, which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Merchants are an important constituency in our payments system, and we rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our customers, to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices.  Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope.  We believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including MasterCard.  Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that MasterCard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations as to which the Company recently entered into a settlement agreement (subject to final court approval).  See our risk factor in this Part I,  with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act.  The increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.   Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices.  As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives.   Certain customers have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment products, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business.  Certain customers have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment products, and these relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues.  In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with exclusive or nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors.  Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned.  A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.   We depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payments system.  If we are unable to maintain those relationships, or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our products for payment, our business may be materially and adversely affected.  While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants and governments, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services.  We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders using our products.  Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features.  In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers.  As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them.  In turn, our customers' success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence.  If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below.  With the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors.  Because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships with cardholders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with these stakeholders.  From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.  If our customers' actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands, cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs, which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations.  In addition, our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the United States than we do.  As a result, our inability to control the end-to-end processing on cards and other payment devices carrying our 31Table of Contentsbrands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce value-added programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions.  We rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our products and programs.  Although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network, there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful.  If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our business could suffer. The marketplace's perception of our brands and reputation may materially and adversely affect our overall business.  Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business.  The ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of us and our industry.  Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands.  From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”.  Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny.  We have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace.  Under some circumstances, such use could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands.  Such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business.   Unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected, and may continue to affect, many of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, which could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.     The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  Unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention.  The economies of the United States and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil.  Countries have experienced credit ratings actions by rating agencies, including several in Europe as well as the United States.  In addition, some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments.  Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations.  Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our products and cardholders who use our products have been directly and adversely impacted.  MasterCard's financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  The condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  As a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or we may be impacted, in several ways, including but not limited to the following:•Declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross-border travel patterns, which may continue to change.•Constriction of consumer and business confidence, such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders. •Uncertainties in the United States related to the upcoming deadline on the debt limit and budgetary discussions could affect the United States' credit rating and could affect consumer confidence and spending. •Our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults.•Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers' businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable.•Our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability.•Our customers may decrease spending for value-added services.•Government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments in our customers, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.32Table of Contents•Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility.•Our customers may default on their settlement obligations, including due to an increased probability of sovereign defaults in several European countries causing a liquidity crisis for our customers.  See Note 19 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our settlement exposure.•Our overall business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers. See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to additional consolidation for further discussion. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our results of operations, as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from cross-border transactions.  We process substantially all cross-border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and transaction processing fees.  Revenue from processing cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross-border travel and our customers' need for transactions to be converted into their base currency.  Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, weather and other conditions.  These include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases.  Any such decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our results of operations.  General economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending, which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations.  The global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending.  General economic conditions (such as unemployment, housing and changes in interest rates) and other political conditions (such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending, as well as the impact of events in the United States such as the upcoming deadline on the debt limit) in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices.  Also, as we are principally based in the United States, a negative perception of the United States could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business.As a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees, we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity.   We may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons.  If a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of MasterCard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers, we may bear the loss.  In addition, although we are not obligated to do so, we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations, or to keep prepaid cardholders whole if an issuer defaults on its obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid funds.  Our MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded gross legal settlement exposure, which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, was approximately $38 billion as of December 31, 2012.  We have a revolving credit facility in the amount of $3 billion which could be used for general corporate purposes, including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In the event that MasterCard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer, MasterCard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from the failed customer.  Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of MasterCard.  While we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day, the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited.  As a result, concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  Moreover, during 2012, many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events in the financial markets which began during 2008 and the economic turmoil that has ensued.  The European financial crisis remains a heightened concern.  Our aggregate gross settlement exposures to Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, four of the countries most significantly impacted by the Eurozone crisis, are less than 5% of our total gross settlement 33Table of Contentsexposure and are being managed through various planning and risk mitigation practices.  Nonetheless, these conditions present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees.  Separately, MasterCard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform.  For more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices as of December 31, 2012, see Note 19 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. A failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. Information security risks for payments and technology companies such as MasterCard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties.  These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches.  Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.  Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as our cardholders, rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct their operations.  In addition, to access our products and services, our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control systems.  We routinely receive cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to cyber-attacks.  Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that such threats may continue, and that we are likely to continue to be a target of such attacks.  To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches.  However, if one or more of these events occurs, it could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises.  Such events could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added systems), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties.  Any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs to MasterCard (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities.  If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.We maintain an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage, and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection, in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks.  We also test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities.  Despite these mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future.  Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of MasterCard and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities.  As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.  As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.  Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. If our transaction processing systems and other services are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions or service our customers efficiently or at all, our results of operations would be materially reduced. Our transaction processing systems and other key service offerings may experience interruptions as a result of a disaster including, but not limited to, technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events.  Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities and/or systems.  A disaster that occurs at, or in the vicinity of, our primary and/or back-up facilities in any global location could interrupt our services. Although 34Table of Contentswe maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks.  Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network.  Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets.  If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services.  Because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially reduce our results of operations.   Account data breaches involving card data stored, processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. We, our issuers and acquirers, merchants and other third parties process, transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices.  In addition, our customers may sponsor (or we may certify as PCI-compliant) third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use.  A breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed, transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands, damage our reputation and lead to claims against us, as well as subject us to regulatory actions.  We routinely encounter account data compromise events, some of which have been high profile, involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment card data, which affect millions of MasterCard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of cardholders.  These events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants' or third-party processors' systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the servers.  As a result of such data security breaches, we may be subject to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands.  While most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us, we could face damage claims in various circumstances, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us.An increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and/or regulatory intervention, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices.  Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud.  As outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards.  Increased fraud levels involving our cards, or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards, could lead to regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements, as well as damage to our reputation, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business.  Rapid technological developments in our industry present both operational and legal challenges (including potential intellectual property exposure) which could impact our results of operations or limit our future growth.  The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, radio frequency and proximity payment devices (such as contactless payment devices), electronic commerce and mobile commerce, among others.  We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business.  We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies.  We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services.  In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems.  Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties.  We have received, and we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (for example, other operating companies or non-practicing entities) suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement.  Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or demand significant license fees.  Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.  Failure to keep pace with these technological developments could lead to a decline in the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.   35Table of ContentsAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations. During 2012, approximately 61% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the United States.  This revenue (and the related expense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues.  Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income.  Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies.In addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations (including devaluations of currencies) where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar.  If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected.  Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S. dollars.  The occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Acquisitions, strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation.  Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of, or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to, complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses, products or technologies.  In addition, the integration of any acquisition or investment (including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity) may divert management's time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations.  Moreover, we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue.  To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders.  Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations, including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition.  Any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements.  Our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage.  Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions. Risks Related to our Class A Common Stock and Governance Structure Future sales of our shares of Class A common stock could depress the market price of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.  These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future.  As of February 7, 2013, we had 117,961,825 outstanding shares of Class A common stock, of which 12,378,831 shares were owned by The MasterCard Foundation (the “Foundation”).  Under the terms of the donation of these shares by MasterCard to the Foundation, the Foundation became able to sell its shares of our Class A common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the IPO in May 2006 to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements.  Under Canadian tax law, the Foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 3.5% of its assets not used in administration of the Foundation in qualified charitable disbursements.  Despite permission from the Canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to 15 years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the 15-year period, the Foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year.  The market price of our common stock could be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world.  This market volatility, as well as the factors listed below, among others, could affect the market price of our common stock: •the continuation of unprecedented economic events around the world in financial markets as well as political conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;•quarterly variations in our results of operations or the results of operations of our competitors;36Table of Contents•changes in earnings estimates, investors' perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' earnings estimates;•the announcement of new products or service enhancements by us or our competitors;•announcements related to litigation, regulation or legislative activity;•potential acquisitions by us of other companies; and•developments in our industry.There are terms in our charter documents and under Delaware law that could be considered anti-takeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control. Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable.  These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control, which could harm our stock price.  For example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power.  Further, except in limited circumstances, no customer or former customer of MasterCard, or any operator, customer or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system, or any affiliate of any such person, may beneficially own any share of Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.  In addition, •our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors;•holders of our Class A common stock are not entitled to act by written consent;•our stockholders must provide timely notice for any stockholder proposals and director nominations;•a vote of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our stock then entitled to vote is required for stockholders to amend any provision of our bylaws; and•any representative of a competitor of MasterCard or of the Foundation is disqualified from service on our board of directors.A substantial portion of our voting power is held by the Foundation, which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders.  In addition, the ownership of Class A common stock by the Foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common stock. As of February 7, 2013, the Foundation owns 12,378,831 shares of Class A common stock, representing approximately 10.5% of our general voting power.  The Foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of Class A common stock prior to April 26, 2026 (twenty years and eleven months following the IPO), except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements, for which purpose earlier sales are permitted.  The directors of the Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers.  The ownership of Class A common stock by the Foundation, together with the restrictions on transfer, could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common stock.  In addition, because the Foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders. Our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows. MasterCard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  Our board of directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely.  The payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders.  However, sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends.  Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.  If, as a 37Table of Contentsconsequence of these various factors, we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.Item 1B
