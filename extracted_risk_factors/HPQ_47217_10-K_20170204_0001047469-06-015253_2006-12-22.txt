Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

General  

        The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 

36




 


not
readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management
believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 


        An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Revenue Recognition  

        We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are
agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price
should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known,
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements. Changes in the allocation
of the sales price between elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract. 


        We
recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements. Using a proportional performance method, we estimate the total expected labor
costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We follow this basis because reasonably
dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract. We record changes in
revenue as a result of revisions to cost estimates to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. 

        We
record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and
expected returns. Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. 

Restructuring  

        We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance
and other employee separation costs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation and other exit costs. If the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the
restructuring charges could be materially impacted. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions 

37




 


of
restructuring in the Results of Operations section and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference. 


Stock-Based Compensation Expense  

        Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123
(revised 2004), "Shared-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), using the modified prospective transition method, and therefore have not restated prior periods' results. Under this method, we recognize
stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 and granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005, in accordance with
SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, we recognize stock-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for
only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Prior to SFAS 123R adoption, we accounted for share-based payment awards
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and, accordingly, generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options
with a discounted exercise price. 

        Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the
share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. Management determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected
volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility. Therefore, expected volatility in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was based on a market-based implied volatility. The assumptions used
in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a
result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected
forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be
significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. 

Taxes on Earnings  

        We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax
returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them, which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent
year for U.S. federal and state provisions, respectively. 

        We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely
than not to realize. We have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future,
we would increase the 

38




 


valuation
allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net
deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient
taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. 


        Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely
outside the United
States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and
our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the United States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts. Further, as a result of
certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from
taxes, for fiscal years through 2019. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business
could impact our effective tax rate. 

        We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and over sixty foreign countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that our tax return positions are fully supported, but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions, which may not be fully sustained. However, our income tax expense includes amounts
intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities
requires significant management judgments and estimates. We evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." We believe that our reserve for
income tax liabilities, including related interest, is adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially
different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our reserve for income tax
liabilities is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, and related
interest. We review our reserves quarterly, and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations or new
case law, previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices, execution of
Advanced Pricing Agreements, resolution with respect to individual audit issues, the resolution of entire audits, or the expiration of statutes of limitations. Material adjustments are most likely to
occur in the fiscal years in which major ongoing audits, such as audits by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), are closed. In addition, our tax contingency reserve includes certain amounts for
potential tax assessments for pre-acquisition tax years of acquired companies which, if released, will impact the carrying value of goodwill attributable to the acquired company. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

        We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances
due to uncollectibility. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall
weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of 

39




 


third-party
credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, and the financial condition of customers. Also, we record specific provisions for
individual accounts when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating
results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward. The annual provision
for doubtful accounts is approximately 0.03% of net revenue over the last three fiscal years. Using our third-party credit risk model at October 31, 2006, a 50-basis-point deterioration in
either the weighted average default probabilities of our significant customers or in the overall mix of our portfolio would have resulted in an approximately $26 million increase to our trade
allowance at the end of fiscal year 2006. 

Inventory  

        We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, at the
product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product life cycle and
development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates. 

Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets  

        We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that we perform a
two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable
segments identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on
the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of
the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net
assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the
reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. SFAS No. 142 also
requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an
income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. 

        Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates,
future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain. Actual 

40




 


future
results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our
reporting units. 

        Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value
for each of HP's reporting units as of August 1, 2006, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $350 million to approximately $41.4 billion. In order to evaluate the
sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would
result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $200 million to approximately $36.6 billion for each of HP's reporting units. 


Warranty Provision  

        We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our
standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base
our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms, ongoing product failure rates, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, and current period product shipments. If actual product
failure rates, repair rates, service delivery costs or post-sales support costs differ from our estimates, we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability.
Warranty terms generally range from 90 days parts-only to three years parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty provision
has averaged approximately 3.6% of annual net product revenue, while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 3.4% of annual net product revenue. 

Retirement Benefits  

        Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate primarily to
discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income
investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook.
Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management's expectation of the future economic environment, as well as target asset allocations.
Our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Actual results that differ
from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. 

        Our
major assumptions vary by plan and the weighted average rates used are set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference. Each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics, and, in general, changes, if any, have moved in the 

41




 


same
direction over the last several years. For fiscal 2006, changes in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost: 



•a
decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $31 million;
•a
decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $49 million; and
•an
increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $27 million.

        In
fiscal 2006, HP net revenue increased approximately 6% from the prior year period (7% on a constant currency basis). The unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2006 was due primarily
to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. U.S. net revenue was $32.2 billion for fiscal 2006, an increase of 6% from the prior year, while international net revenue increased
6% to $59.4 billion. 

        PSG
net revenue increased across all regions as a result of a 15% volume increase. The volume increase resulted from strong growth in consumer and commercial markets and significant
improvement in emerging markets, which was partially offset by 6% and 7% declines in average selling prices ("ASPs") in consumer and commercial clients, respectively. IPG net revenue growth in fiscal
2006 was due mainly to increased shipment volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong performance of color-related products. ESS
net revenue growth was the result primarily of strong unit growth in our industry standard servers business ("ISS"), Blade revenue growth, increased option attach rates in our ProLiant server line,
continued strong performance in mid-range EVA products within our Storage business and revenue increases from our Integrity servers. The ESS growth was moderated by revenue declines in our
tape business and PA-RISC and Alpha Server product lines. The net revenue growth in Software for fiscal 2006 was due primarily to growth in our OpenView business as a result of the
Peregrine acquisition and an increase in support and service contracts. HPS net revenue increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to revenue increases in management services driven by new business and
existing account growth, which were offset by declines in the technology services business resulting from competitive pricing pressures and changes in the mix of platforms being serviced. The HPFS net
revenue decline in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to lower used equipment sales. 

        In
fiscal 2005, HP net revenue increased approximately 8% from the prior year period (6% on a constant currency basis). The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the weakening
of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened against the euro and the yen
during that period. U.S. net revenue was $30.5 billion for fiscal 2005, an increase of 4% from the prior year, while international net revenue increased 11% to $56.2 billion. 

        In
PSG, net revenue increased across all regions as a result of a 13% volume increase in consumer and commercial clients. The volume increase was partially offset by a decline of 4% in
ASPs. Notebook 

43




 


PC
sales were the leading contributor to net revenue growth in PSG. HPS achieved net revenue growth across all businesses in fiscal 2005 due in large part to the impact of acquisitions (benefiting
primarily technology services) and favorable currency impacts. Additionally, managed services net revenue increased due to both new contract signings and additional contract revenue from the installed
base. In fiscal 2005, ESS net revenue growth was the result primarily of continued strong sales of industry standard servers, particularly our ProLiant server line, due to volume increases and higher
ASPs resulting from improved option attach rates. IPG net revenue growth in fiscal 2005 was the result of increased unit growth of printer supplies, particularly LaserJet toner, as a result of the
increasing demand for color-related products. The demand for color-related products also added to the revenue growth in commercial hardware. Both Software and HPFS contributed to HP net revenue growth
for fiscal 2005 as growing acceptance of our OpenView product offerings contributed to Software revenue growth while higher used equipment sales and a higher mix of operating leases benefited HPFS. 

Stock-Based Compensation Expense  

        Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method and
therefore have not restated results for prior periods. Our results of operations in fiscal 2006 were impacted by the recognition of non-cash expense related to the fair value of our
share-based payment awards. In fiscal 2006, we recorded $536 million in pre-tax stock-based compensation expense based on SFAS 123R, of which $144 million was included
in cost of sales, $70 million was included in research and development expense and $322 million was included in sales, general and administrative expense. Total stock-based compensation
expense for SFAS 123R, net of taxes, in fiscal 2006 was $376 million. In addition, we recognized an adjustment of $14 million to reduce non-cash stock-based
compensation expense which was included as part of our restructuring expenses. The stock-based compensation expense related to HP-granted employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan is
recorded at the corporate level and therefore does not have an impact on segment results. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

<A
NAME="page_dm1296_1_45">  

        Total company gross margin increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement in ESS gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a
favorable unit mix, improved discount management, and lower component costs. HPS gross margin increase was driven mainly by the continued focus on cost structure improvement from delivery efficiencies
and cost controls, which were partially offset by the continued competitive environment in the solutions and services business and higher fiscal 2006 bonus accruals. For IPG, the gross margin
increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to improved supplies margins and a favorable portfolio mix shift from hardware to supplies, which were partially offset by unfavorable consumer hardware margins.
The improvement in Software gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an increase in revenue and more effective management of the support and services costs for OpenView and OpenCall. The gross
margin improvement in PSG resulted primarily from reduced warranty expense and supply chain costs as a percentage of revenue and component cost declines. HPFS gross margin was impacted unfavorably in
fiscal 2006 due primarily to competitor pricing pressures, a higher mix of lower margin operating lease assets and lower recoveries for bad debts, which were partially offset by lower credit losses in
fiscal 2006. 

        Total
company gross margin decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. For IPG, the gross margin decline in fiscal 2005 was attributable primarily to a mix shift within supplies
from inkjet cartridges to LaserJet toner and continuing decreases in ASPs within hardware due to strategic pricing actions. The gross margin decline in HPS in fiscal 2005 reflected primarily
competitive pricing pressures and portfolio mix shifts within technology services along with higher employee bonus costs in the second half of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, ESS gross margin
increased slightly as the benefits of improved option attach rates in industry standard servers and improved performance in storage helped to offset the unfavorable impact from the continued mix shift
towards industry standard servers within the segment and the mix shift to lower margin products within business critical systems. The gross margin contribution for HPFS and Software increased slightly
in fiscal 2005 as lower bad debt expense increased gross margin in HPFS, while an increase in both OpenView and OpenCall gross margins benefited the Software business. The gross margin improvement in
PSG in fiscal 2005 resulted from component cost declines, product mix shift towards higher margin notebook PCs and reduced warranty costs. 

Operating Expenses  



Research and Development 



        Total
research and development ("R&D") expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to revenue growing faster than
R&D expense. R&D expense increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by expense controls and cost savings from
restructuring actions. As a percentage of net revenue, each of our major segments experienced a year-over-year decrease in R&D expense in fiscal 2006. 


        In
fiscal 2005, total R&D expense as a percentage of net revenue declined from the same period in the prior year due primarily to savings resulting from workforce reductions and tight
expense controls. These savings were partially offset by increased costs for the company bonus and costs associated with the workforce rebalancing actions taken in the first half of the fiscal year.
As a percentage of net revenue, each of our segments experienced a decrease in research and development expense in fiscal 2005 as we worked to focus our investments and manage realignment, while also
continuing to drive new technologies and business opportunities. Such decreases resulted in part from 

45




 


cost
control measures, including the benefit from workforce reduction actions in ESS, the consolidation and realignment of certain IPG research and development infrastructure and lower program
spending. 



Selling, General and Administrative 



        Selling,
general and administrative ("SG&A") expense declined as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2006 due primarily to the increase in net revenue outpacing SG&A expense
growth. Total SG&A expense increased slightly during fiscal 2006 as higher bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expenses as well as increased marketing spending were offset in part by savings
from expense controls and restructuring actions and favorable currency impacts due to movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. As a percentage of net revenue, each of our segments
experienced a year-over-year decrease or no change in SG&A expense in fiscal 2006. 

        SG&A
expense decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2005, as net revenue growth was higher than the growth of SG&A due in part to tight company-wide
expense controls. On an absolute basis, SG&A spending increased 6.6% in fiscal 2005 due primarily to higher employee bonuses earned in the second half of fiscal 2005 and unfavorable currency impacts. 



Pension Curtailment 



        In
conjunction with management's plan to restructure certain of our operations, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we modified our U.S.
retirement programs to align more closely to industry practice. Effective January 1, 2006, we ceased pension accruals and eliminated eligibility for the subsidized retiree medical program for
current employees who did not meet defined criteria based on age and years of service. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $199 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
stemming from the elimination of future benefit accruals for the affected employee group. In fiscal 2006, we recognized additional curtailment gains, which were included in our restructuring charges
as described below. 

        For
more information on our plan design changes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. 



Restructuring Charges 



        Restructuring
charges in fiscal year 2006 were $158 million. This included a net charge of $233 million related to true-ups of severance and other related
restructuring charges for all restructuring plans, a $6 million termination benefits expense and a $3 million settlement and curtailment loss from our non-U.S. pension plans
related to the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. These charges were partially offset by a $46 million settlement
gain from the U.S. pension plans, a $24 million curtailment gain from the U.S. retiree medical program and a $14 million adjustment to reduce our non-cash stock-based
compensation expense, all related to our fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. 

        The
fiscal 2005 restructuring plan was designed to simplify our structure, reduce costs and place greater focus on our customers. We included original estimates of 15,300 positions to be
eliminated in the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan. Subsequent to the initial estimate, we reduced the number of total positions to be eliminated to 15,200. Approximately 14,200 positions have been
eliminated as of October 31, 2006 in connection with this restructuring plan, including 3,200 U.S. employees who elected to take early retirement. 

46




 


        Restructuring
charges in fiscal 2005 were $1.7 billion. This included a $1.6 billion charge for the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005. Also of the total charges for fiscal 2005, $109 million was related to severance and related costs associated with the termination of approximately 1,450 employees in connection with a
restructuring plan approved by our management in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. All employees under this restructuring plan were terminated as of October 31, 2005. Of the initial
restructuring amount, we have paid substantially all of it as of October 31, 2006. 

        Restructuring
costs in fiscal 2004 mainly reflected certain charges relating to the fiscal 2003 restructuring plan, which did not meet recognition requirements during fiscal 2003, as
well as changes in the original estimates for the fiscal 2003 plan and a fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. 


        Restructuring
liabilities of $638 million at October 31, 2006 are composed primarily of the remaining cash payments to be made for severance relating to the fiscal 2005
restructuring plan and certain non-U.S. severance benefits and contract termination costs, including canceled facility leases for the other restructuring plans. We expect to make the
majority of the remaining severance payments before the end of fiscal 2007 and to settle the non-severance obligations by the end of fiscal 2010. 

        For
more information on our restructuring charges, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

 Fiscal 2005 Workforce Rebalancing  



        In addition to the restructuring activities described above, in fiscal 2005 we incurred approximately $236 million in workforce rebalancing charges
resulting from actions taken by certain business segments for severance and related costs. Workforce rebalancing costs were included in the segment results. We recorded these costs during the six
months ended April 30, 2005. As a result of these workforce rebalancing actions, we reduced headcount by approximately 3,000 employees in certain business segments as of October 31,
2005. Of the initial restructuring amount, we have paid substantially all of it as of October 31, 2006. 

47




 



Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets 



        The
decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated
with prior acquisitions including Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq") acquisition that had reached the end of their amortization period, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense
related primarily to the Scitex Vision Ltd. ("Scitex"), Peregrine Systems, Inc. ("Peregrine"), and OuterBay Technologies, Inc. ("OuterBay") acquisitions in fiscal year 2006. 

        The
increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Triaton in
April 2004, Synstar PLC ("Synstar") in October 2004 and SAC, LLC ("Snapfish") in April 2005, as well as accelerated amortization related to the early termination of certain
acquired customer contracts. 

        For
more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. 



Acquisition-Related Charges 



        Acquisition-related
charges in fiscal 2004 consisted of costs related to Compaq acquisition, which included primarily the amortization of deferred compensation, merger-related inventory
adjustments and professional fees. 



In-Process Research and Development Charges 



        We
record in-process research & development ("IPR&D") charges in connection with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, as more fully described in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 we recorded IPR&D charges of $52 million, $2 million and $37 million, respectively,
related to acquisitions during those years. 

Interest and Other, Net  

        Interest and other, net increased by $417 million in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from higher net interest
income over the prior year related to higher short-term interest rates in fiscal 2006, net gains from sales of certain real estate properties, and lower interest expenses due to our lower
average debt balances. The increase in fiscal 2006 also was attributable to a charge recorded in fiscal 2005 for estimated sales and use taxes and related interest associated with
pre-acquisition Compaq sales and use tax audits as described below. 

        Interest
and other, net increased by $154 million in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 was the result primarily of higher short-term U.S.
interest rates, which increased the interest income from our cash balances and reduced the cost associated with foreign exchange hedges. Increased interest expense and a charge related to a sales and
use tax audit of Compaq prior to its acquisition by HP for the fiscal years 1998-2002 partially offset the increase in interest and other, net for fiscal 2005. 


Gains (Losses) on Investments  

        Net gains in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from gains on the sale of investments, which were offset in part by impairment charges on our investment portfolio.
Net losses in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from impairment charges on equity investments in our publicly-traded and privately-held investment 

48




 


portfolios.
Partially offsetting these losses were gains attributable to the sale of investments. Net gains in fiscal 2004 were attributable mainly to the realization of a contingent gain associated
with a prior period divestiture and realized gains from the sale of investments in excess of impairment charges. 

Dispute Settlement  

        In fiscal 2005, we recorded a net total of $106 million in dispute settlement charges. We reached a legal settlement of $141 million in our patent
infringement case with Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company ("Intergraph") and recorded a charge of $116 million related to a cross-license agreement with Intergraph for products shipped in
prior years. Partially offsetting this amount was a $10 million recovery from an individual related to a prior period settlement with the Government of Canada.
During fiscal 2004, we recorded $70 million in settlement costs from a dispute with the Government of Canada. For other settlement matters, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Provision for Taxes  

        Our effective tax rate was 13.8%, 32.3% and 16.7% in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

        The
decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was related in part to other income tax adjustments of $599 million in fiscal 2006. This included net
favorable tax adjustments of $565 million to income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of IRS examinations of our U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998. The reductions
to the net income tax accruals for these years related primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to Puerto Rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives, and other issues
involving our non-U.S. operations. In addition, the decrease in the overall tax rate in 2006 from fiscal 2005 was attributable in part to $697 million of income tax expense related
to items unique to fiscal 2005. The tax expense was the result primarily of $792 million associated with the repatriation of $14.5 billion under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
("Jobs Act") and $76 million related to additional distributions received from foreign subsidiaries. These tax expenses were offset in part by tax benefits of $177 million resulting from
agreements with the IRS and other governmental authorities. 

        The
increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 was related primarily to tax expense associated with the repatriation of $14.5 billion under the provisions of
the Jobs Act which was partially offset by the increase in the tax benefit derived from lower rates in other jurisdictions. The Jobs Act, enacted on October 22, 2004, provided for a temporary
85% dividend received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated
earnings. 

        In
fiscal 2004, our tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities of $207 million, which decreased the provision for taxes. The most
significant favorable adjustments related to the resolution of a California state income tax audit, a net favorable revision to estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2003 U.S. income tax return and a
reduction in taxes on foreign earnings due to a change in regulatory policy. These favorable adjustments were offset in part by the net effect of smaller adjustments to income tax liabilities in
various jurisdictions. 


        For
a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

        ESS
net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. On a constant currency basis, ESS net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The unfavorable currency impact
for fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. 

        The
net revenue growth in industry standard servers of 6% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was driven by strong unit growth and the growth in Blade revenue as well as increased
option attach rates in the ProLiant server line. 

        Storage
net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to continued strong performance in mid-range EVA products within the storage area networks
offerings while the tape business decline moderated the overall storage growth. 

50




 


        Business
critical systems net revenue decreased 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. This decrease was due primarily to revenue declines in the PA-RISC product line and
to the planned phase out of our Alpha Server product line. The declines were partially offset by net revenue growth in our Integrity servers which posted strong net revenue growth, reaching 37% of the
business critical systems revenue mix in fiscal 2006 up from 20% in the prior fiscal year. Revenue mix from Integrity servers will continue to grow as customers migrated from PA-RISC and Alpha
products. Integrity server revenue in fiscal 2006 also included revenue from Montecito-based Integrity servers which were first shipped in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. NonStop server net revenue
decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to the revenue decrease on the discontinued product line, which was partially offset by NonStop Integrity product revenue growth. 


        In
fiscal 2006, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 3.6 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005, due primarily to an increase in gross
margin combined with a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The improvement in gross margin was due primarily to a favorable unit mix, improved discount management, and lower
component costs. The increase was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards industry standard servers within the segment and the ongoing mix shift to lower-margin Integrity products within
business critical systems. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from increased revenue and decreased operating expenses in fiscal 2006.
The decreased operating expenses
reflected the benefits of our expense controls, which were partially offset by higher bonus accruals in fiscal 2006. 

        ESS
net revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. On a constant currency basis, ESS net revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The favorable currency impact
was due primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened
against the euro and the yen during that period. 

        In
fiscal 2005, ESS net revenue growth was due primarily to volume increases and improved average selling prices ASPs in industry standard servers, as a result of both unit growth and
increased option attach rates in the ProLiant server line. The fiscal 2005 net revenue growth rate in industry standard servers benefited from certain internal execution problems that unfavorably
impacted the business in the second half of fiscal 2004. 

        Storage
net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due to new product introductions that contributed to the strong performance of mid-range EVA products
and improved storage sales specialist coverage. In fiscal 2005, storage area networks ("SANs") net revenue improved while revenue growth in the tape and supplies businesses remained flat. Fiscal 2005
storage net revenue growth rates, in comparison with growth rates in the prior year, benefited from the business challenges that unfavorably impacted the storage business in the second half of the
prior year. 

        Business
critical systems net revenue increased 1% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Integrity server net revenue growth for the period was offset partially by revenue decline in
the RISC product line and the planned revenue decline in the Alpha Server product line. The Integrity server product line posted net revenue growth for the year, representing 20% of the total business
critical systems revenue mix, up from 11% in the prior year. In fiscal 2005, HP-UX server net revenue increased 5% from the prior year, and NonStop server net revenue declined due to a
mature installed base. 


        In
fiscal 2005, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 3.8 percentage points compared to fiscal 2004, due primarily to a combination of a
decrease in 

51




 


operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in gross margin. We recorded $57 million of workforce reduction costs in the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. Our reduced
operating expenses reflected the benefits of these measures as well as management controls on expense spending, which offset the impact of the higher employee bonus accruals recorded in the second
half of the year. The improvement in margin was due primarily to higher option attach rates and improved discount management, which were offset partially by the continued mix shift towards industry
standard servers within the segment as well as the ongoing mix shift to lower margin products within the business critical systems business as Integrity products assumed a greater percentage of
business critical systems net revenue. In addition, the year-over-year industry standard servers and storage gross margins comparisons were favorably impacted by execution
issues and business challenges that unfavorably affected the performance of industry standard servers and storage in the second half of fiscal 2004.

unfavorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. 

        Net
revenue in technology services decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to declines related to competitive pricing pressures and changes in the mix of platforms
being serviced. This decline was moderated by growth in our IT solutions business such as integrated support services. 

52






<A
NAME="page_do1296_1_53">  

        In fiscal 2006, the 6% growth in managed services net revenue from the prior year was driven mainly by new business and existing account growth, with continued
focus on making more strategic portfolio decisions to improve profitability. 


        Net
revenue in consulting and integration increased 2% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to improved performance in Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa
("EMEA"). 

        HPS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 increased by 2.2 percentage points. The operating margin increase was the result of a combination of an
increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase in HPS was due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvement
from delivery efficiencies and cost controls, which were partially offset by the continued competitive environment in solutions and services business and higher fiscal 2006 bonus accruals. In fiscal
year 2006, improved efficiencies in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal year 2005 despite the impact of
higher bonus accruals in fiscal 2006. Technology services operating margin in fiscal 2006 continued to benefit from improved delivery efficiencies and cost controls as well as portfolio decisions made
to improve profitability, all of which were offset in part by the impact of the ongoing portfolio mix shift from higher margin proprietary support to lower margin areas such as multi-vendor integrated
support and solution services. Managed services operating margin increased in fiscal 2006 due to delivery efficiencies, reduced operating expenses and more strategic portfolio decisions made to
improve profitability. Consulting and integration operating margin improved in fiscal 2006 due to more efficient utilization of our consultants and reduced operating expenses. 


        HPS
net revenue increased 12% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. On a constant currency basis, HPS net revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The favorable currency impact
was due primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened
against the euro and the yen during that period. Excluding acquisitions made since the first quarter of fiscal 2004, HPS net revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was 8%. Net revenue in technology services
increased 9% in fiscal 2005. Excluding acquisitions made since the first quarter of fiscal 2004, technology services net revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was 4%. 


        In
fiscal 2005, managed services net revenue increased 24% from the prior-year as a result of an increase in new contracts, as well as additional revenue from our installed
base of large customer contracts, the full year contribution of the Triaton acquisition (which we completed in April 2004) and favorable currency impacts. Excluding Triaton, managed services
net revenue growth was 22% for fiscal 2005 compared to the prior fiscal year. 

        Net
revenue in consulting and integration increased 13% in fiscal 2005 from the prior year due to strong order growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific, as well as the favorable impact of
currency. Additionally, the Triaton acquisition added to the revenue growth. 


        HPS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2005 declined 1.9 percentage points. The operating margin decline was the result of the combination of a
decline in gross margin offset partially by a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline in HPS reflected primarily competitive pricing pressures and
portfolio mix shifts within technology services, as well as the cost of higher employee bonuses recorded in the second half of the fiscal year, and the absorption of workforce reduction costs in the
first half of the year that amounted to $89 million. The technology services portfolio continues to evolve from higher margin 

53




 


proprietary
support to lower margin areas such as multi-vendor integrated support and network environmental services. Managed services gross margin increased due to improvements in delivery cost
management across the installed base. Consulting and integration gross margin improved due to higher revenues and continued operational improvement in presales and delivery cost management. 

        In
fiscal 2005, reductions and efficiencies in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, despite $11 million
in workforce reduction costs in the first half of the fiscal year and the impact of the employee bonuses granted in the second half of the fiscal year.

        In
fiscal 2006, Software net revenue increased 23% (8% excluding the impact of acquisitions and 24% on a constant currency basis) from fiscal 2005. The unfavorable currency impact was
due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen for fiscal 2006. Peregrine, which was acquired in December 2005, represented 14.7 percentage points of Software's
net revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Net revenue associated with the Peregrine acquisition is included in the results of OpenView, our management solutions software product line, which represented
20 percentage points of growth on a weighted average net revenue basis for fiscal 2006. OpenCall, our telecommunications solutions product line, contributed the remaining 3 percentage
points of the weighted average net revenue increase for fiscal 2006. OpenView net revenue growth was the result of acquisitions and increases in support and services contracts. OpenCall net revenue
growth was the result of increased product sales and licenses as well as larger contracts. 

        The
operating margin improvement for fiscal 2006 of 11.1 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2005 was the result primarily of a decrease in operating expense as a percentage
of net revenue and an increase in gross margin. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to growth in field selling costs, research and development and
marketing expenses attributable to cost management efforts that was slower than revenue growth. These cost reductions were partially offset by high integration costs associated with the acquisition of
Peregrine as well as higher bonus accruals. The improvement in gross margin was driven by an increase in revenue, more effective management of the support and services costs for OpenView and OpenCall
and from improved margins of our OpenCall product line resulting from a favorable product mix shift towards higher margin products. 

        In
fiscal 2005, Software net revenue increased 15% (12% without acquisitions) from fiscal 2004 and 13% on a constant currency basis. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to
the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened against the euro and
the yen during that period. OpenView represented 12 percentage points of net revenue growth on a weighted average basis for fiscal 2005. OpenCall represented 3 percentage points of
growth on a weighted average net revenue basis for fiscal 2005. OpenView net revenue growth was the result of increases in larger 

54




 


contracts
and license fees and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. OpenCall net revenue growth was the result of an increase in licenses. 

        The
operating margin improvement of 11.9 percentage points for fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, was the result primarily of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in
operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin improvement was due to higher margin rates in our core businesses and a favorable product mix due to more OpenView license revenue.
The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was due to slower growth in operating expense attributable to cost management efforts, related principally to decreased research and
development costs and slower growth in marketing costs as a percentage of revenue, despite the employee bonus recorded during the second half of fiscal 2005 and acquisition integration costs.

        PSG
net revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. On a constant currency basis, PSG's net revenue increased 10% in fiscal 2006. The unfavorable currency impact was due
primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. In fiscal 2006, net revenue increased across all regions and each business unit with the exception of handhelds, due primarily to
an overall volume increase of 15%. The volume increase in fiscal 2006 was the result of strong growth in the consumer and commercial markets, with significant improvement in emerging markets. Net
revenue for notebook PCs increased 23% while net revenue for desktop PCs increased slightly in fiscal 2006 from the prior year. Net revenue for consumer clients and commercial clients increased 19%
and 4%, respectively, from the prior year. The revenue increases in consumer and commercial clients were partially offset by a decrease in handhelds revenue due to a decline in the Personal Digital
Assistant ("PDA") product market coupled with our product transition to converged devices. 

        The
PSG volume increase in fiscal 2006 was moderated by a decline of 6% in consumer client ASPs and 7% in commercial client ASPs. The ASP declines were due to pricing decisions resulting 

55




 


from
lower component costs as well as competitive pricing pressures, which were partially offset by a strong monitor attach rate in commercial desktops PCs. 

        PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 as a result of gross margin improvement and a
decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was due primarily to reduced supply chain costs and warranty expense as a percentage of net revenue, combined
with component cost declines. The operating expense decline as a percentage of net revenue was the result primarily of the increased net revenue and continued efforts on improving cost structure
through efficiency measures. The operating expenses decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 due primarily to savings from our expense controls, which were partially offset by higher bonus accruals in fiscal
2006. 

        PSG
net revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. On a constant currency basis, PSG's net revenue increased 7% in fiscal 2005. The favorable currency impact was due primarily
to the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened against the euro
and the yen during that period. In fiscal 2005, net revenue increased across all regions as a result of a 13% volume increase, particularly in consumer and commercial clients. Double digit unit growth
in Asia Pacific and EMEA drove the revenue increase. In fiscal 2005, net revenue increases in notebook and desktop PCs were 16% and 3%, respectively, while consumer clients and commercial clients
increased 10% and 7%, respectively, from the prior year. The revenue increases in consumer and commercial clients were offset partially by a decline in handhelds revenue. The performance of digital
entertainment products, such as the Apple iPod from HP, added to the growth in net revenue for the fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we discontinued reselling the Apple iPod. 

        The
PSG volume increase was moderated by a decline of 4% in ASPs, with consumer clients and commercial clients declining 8% and 5%, respectively, in fiscal 2005. The declines in notebook
and desktop ASPs were offset slightly by the digital entertainment mix and an increase in handheld ASPs. The decline in ASPs was due mainly to changes in the notebook product line-up that
leveraged declines in component costs and competitive pressures in consumer PCs. 

        PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.7 percentage points in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase was the result of gross margin
improvement combined with flat operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was due primarily to component cost declines, a product mix shift toward higher margin
notebook PCs, reduced warranty costs and favorable currency impacts. Operating expense as a percentage of revenue was flat, as the impact of the employee bonuses recorded in the second half of the
year was offset by continued cost control measures.

        IPG
net revenue increased 6% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. On a constant currency basis, the net revenue increase was 7% in fiscal 2006. The unfavorable currency impact was due
primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen for fiscal 2006. 

        In
fiscal 2006, the growth in printer supplies net revenue reflected higher unit volumes as a result of the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong performance
of color-related products. The growth in commercial hardware net revenue in fiscal 2006 was attributable mainly to unit volume growth in color laser printers and multifunction printers and, to a
lesser extent, revenue from our large format printing products with the acquisition of Scitex on November 1, 2005. Both commercial and consumer hardware were impacted by the continued shift in
demand to lower-priced products and strategic pricing decisions which caused average revenue per unit to decline. 

        In
fiscal 2006, IPG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 1.3 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2005, which was the result primarily of an
increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was due primarily to improved margins for supplies due to product mix and a
favorable portfolio mix shift from hardware to supplies, which was partially offset by unfavorable consumer hardware margins. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal 2006 declined,
due mainly to realized savings from our cost structure initiatives coupled with increased revenue and partially offset by higher bonus accruals. 

        IPG
net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. On a constant currency basis, the net revenue increase was 2% in fiscal 2005. The favorable currency impact was due
primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and to a lesser extent in the fourth fiscal quarter as the dollar strengthened against
the euro and the yen during that period. 

        In
fiscal 2005, the growth in supplies net revenue was attributable primarily to unit growth in LaserJet toner, due primarily to increased sales of color-related products. The growth in
commercial hardware net revenue in fiscal 2005 was attributable to unit volume growth in color LaserJet printers, multifunction printers and the digital press business. New product introductions added
to the net revenue growth in multifunction printers. The effect of the commercial hardware volume increase was offset partially by decreasing ASPs. In fiscal 2005, consumer hardware net revenue
decreased. This decline was the result of continuing decreases in ASPs due to strategic pricing actions, the continued mix shift in demand to lower-priced products, intense competition in both the
all-in-one and single function inkjet printers and the ongoing decline in the scanner market. 

57




 


        In
fiscal 2005, IPG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue declined by 2.3 percentage points due primarily to a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net
revenue which was offset partially by a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was attributable to a mix shift within supplies from inkjet cartridges to
LaserJet toner, a low-end mix shift in consumer hardware, voluntary severance incentive charges and strategic pricing actions. Operating expense, as a percentage of net revenue, remained
relatively flat
year-over-year, with a slight increase in spending due to voluntary severance incentive charges taken in the first half of the fiscal year and the second half of the year
employee bonus expense offsetting the favorable impact of headcount reductions and lower program spending in research and development.

        HPFS
net revenue decreased by 1% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The net revenue decrease was due primarily to lower used equipment sales and other
end-of-lease revenue, which were largely offset by a higher mix of leases classified as operating leases. 

        In
fiscal 2006, the 3.0 percentage point decrease in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue consisted of a decrease in gross margin, which was partially offset by
a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was due primarily to competitor pricing pressures, a higher mix of lower margin operating lease assets and
lower recoveries for bad debts, which were partially offset by lower credit losses. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was the result of cost savings achieved through
continued cost controls. 

        HPFS
net revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The net revenue increase was the result primarily of higher used equipment sales and a higher mix of leases
classified as operating leases. 

        In
fiscal 2005, the 3.5 percentage point increase in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue consisted of an increase in gross margin, which was partially offset
by an increase in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase resulted primarily from lower bad debt expense, which was partially offset by a higher mix of lower margin
operating lease assets. The decrease in bad debt expense was due in part to the release in fiscal 2005 of $40 million of reserves related to aged receivables in EMEA that have since been
collected. The reserves were established in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Recoveries from accounts in Latin America previously written-off, lower credit losses and a reduction of
reserves resulting from a stronger portfolio risk profile also contributed to the decrease in bad debt expense. 

        The
slight increase in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2005 was the result mainly of a $62 million net reduction in revenue resulting from the
reclassification of certain leases from operating leases to capital leases. This reclassification was the result of a review of the leasing portfolio for appropriate lease classification.

        New
financing originations, which represent the amounts of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, and include intercompany activity, decreased
3% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The decrease reflects lower financing associated with HP product sales. Financing originations increased 7% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 due to higher financing
of HP product sales and a favorable currency impact. 

Portfolio Assets and Ratios  

        HPFS maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio against the risks associated with interest rates and
credit. The HPFS business model is asset-intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is
derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company. However, certain
intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        The
portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for HPFS were as follows for the following fiscal years ended October 31:

a stronger portfolio risk profile. 

        HPFS

        In
fiscal 2006, the majority of the net revenue in Corporate Investments related to network infrastructure products, which grew 8% as a result of continued increased sales of gigabit
Ethernet switch products. 

        Corporate
Investments' loss from operations in fiscal 2006 decreased compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower operating expenses related to global alliances and HP Labs and higher
gross profits from network infrastructure products. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to savings resulting from restructuring actions and lower program spending. Expenses related to
global alliances and HP Labs contributed to the majority of the loss from operations. Such loss was offset in part by operating profit from network infrastructure product sales. 

        In
fiscal 2005, the majority of the net revenue in Corporate Investments related to network infrastructure products, which increased 20% from fiscal 2004 as a result of continued product
enhancements, particularly in gigabit Ethernet switch products. 

        Expenses
related to corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs increased 5% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase was due to higher spending on strategic initiatives and
incubation programs. These expenses, which contributed to the majority of the loss from operations for Corporate Investments, were offset in part by operating profit from network infrastructure
product sales. Corporate Investment's loss from operations for fiscal 2005 decreased slightly from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in operating profit in network infrastructure products as a
result of increasing operating margins, offset partially by an increase in operating expenses related to corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs. The increase in gross margin was due
primarily to a favorable product mix and lower trade discounts as a percentage of net revenue for network infrastructure products. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

        Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States. Most of the amounts held
outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation
of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. HP has provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts for 

60




 


financial
statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Repatriation could result in additional United States federal income
tax payments in future years. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the United States and we would meet
United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is
available in the locations in which it is needed. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION (Sources and Uses of Cash)  

        Our total cash and cash equivalents increased approximately 18% to $16.4 billion at October 31, 2006 from $13.9 billion at the end of fiscal
2005. Net earnings in fiscal 2006 helped generate $11.4 billion in cash from operating activities. The cash generated by operations in fiscal 2006 funded all of the $8.9 billion in
investing and financing activities. Year-over-year outstanding debt was flat at $5.2 billion at October 31, 2006. The net $8.9 billion used for investing
and financing activities during fiscal 2006 included $6.1 billion for share repurchases, $2.0 billion for net investments in property, plant and equipment, $1.7 billion for
prepayment for common stock to be repurchased in future periods, $0.9 billion for cash dividends and $0.9 billion for cash payments on acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities
benefited from $2.5 billion of proceeds relating to employee stock plans. Our cash position remains strong and our cash balances are sufficient to cover significant cash outlays expected in
fiscal 2007 associated with our acquisitions, restructuring actions and company bonus payments.

        Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue. 

        Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing inventory by a 90-day average
cost of goods sold.

<A
NAME="page_dq1296_1_62">  

        Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by
dividing accounts payable by a 90-day average cost of goods sold. 


        Our
working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle, which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for
the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers. The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. 

2006 Compared to 2005  

Operating Activities  

        Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.3 billion during fiscal 2006. The increase in our cash flow from operations was due primarily to
higher earnings and lower payments for pension and taxes, which were partially offset by higher payments for restructuring costs. 

Investing Activities  

        Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1.0 billion during fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher capital expenditures for property, plant and
equipment, lower net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and higher cash paid for acquisitions. 

Financing Activities  

        Net cash used in financing activities increased by $1.1 billion during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was due primarily to a
$2.5 billion increase in repurchases of common stock and a $1.7 billion prepayment for common stock to be repurchased in future periods. These expenditures were partially offset by a
$1.6 billion net increase to financing activities resulting from higher borrowings and lower debt payments and $1.4 billion increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock related
to our employee stock plans mainly due to increased exercises of employee stock options as a result of higher market prices for our common stock during fiscal 2006. 

        We
repurchase shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee benefit plans as well as to repurchase shares
opportunistically. This program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. In fiscal 2006, we completed share repurchases of approximately 188 million shares.
Approximately 190 million shares were settled for $6.1 billion, which included 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2005 but settled in
fiscal 2006, as compared to approximately 150 million shares repurchased, of which 148 million shares were settled for $3.5 billion in fiscal 2005. 

        In
addition to the shares we repurchased, we received approximately 34 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.1 billion under a prepaid variable share purchase program
("PVSPP") entered into with a third-party investment bank during the first quarter of 2006. Under the PVSPP, we prepaid $1.7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in exchange for the
right to receive a variable number of shares of our common stock weekly over a one year period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and ending during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. We
recorded the payment as a prepaid stock repurchase in the stockholders' equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and included the payment in the cash flows from financing activities in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with this program, the investment bank has purchased and will continue to trade shares of 

62




 


our
common stock in the open market over time. The prepaid funds will be expended ratably over the term of the program. 


        Under
the PVSPP, the prices at which we purchase the shares are subject to a minimum and maximum price that was determined in advance of any repurchases being completed under the
program, thereby effectively hedging our repurchase price. The minimum and maximum number of shares we could receive under the program is 52 million shares and 70 million shares,
respectively. The exact number of shares to be repurchased is based upon the volume weighted average market price of our shares during each weekly settlement period, subject to the minimum and maximum
price as well as regulatory limitations on the number of shares we are permitted to repurchase. We decrease our shares outstanding each settlement period as shares are physically received. We will
retire all shares repurchased under the PVSPP, and we will no longer deem those shares outstanding. 


        We
intend to continue to repurchase shares as a means to manage dilution from the issuance of shares under employee benefit plans and to purchase shares opportunistically. During fiscal
2006, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of October 31, 2006, we had remaining
authorization of approximately $5.6 billion for future share repurchases. Previously authorized share repurchases of approximately $600 million also will be made under the PVSPP until the
remaining available balance is exhausted in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. 

2005 Compared to 2004  

Operating Activities  

        Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 58% during fiscal 2005. Our cash position benefited primarily from our improved cash conversion cycle,
which decreased 9 days compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to improved effectiveness in accounts receivable collection efforts and improved inventory management. Our cash flow from operations
also benefited from delayed payments for restructuring costs and company bonuses. These benefits were offset partially by higher pension contributions. 


Investing Activities  

        Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 28% during fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower cash paid for acquisitions and reduced expenditures for property,
plant and equipment. 

Financing Activities  

        Net cash used in financing activities increased by 21% during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase was due primarily to the maturity of our debt
and increased repurchases of our common stock. These cash payments were offset partially by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee stock plans. 


        We
repaid $1.8 billion of debt during fiscal 2005 compared to $0.3 billion during fiscal 2004 primarily due to the maturity of the $1.5 billion U.S. Dollar Global
Notes and the $0.3 billion Medium-Term Notes assumed from the Compaq acquisition. Also, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee plans were $1.2 billion in
fiscal 2005 compared to $0.6 billion in fiscal 2004, mainly because higher overall market prices during fiscal 2005 led to increased exercises of employee stock options. 

63




 


        We
repurchase shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase shares
opportunistically. This program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. We completed share repurchases of approximately 150 million shares, of which
148 million shares were settled for $3.5 billion in fiscal 2005, as compared to repurchases and settlements of approximately 172 million shares for $3.3 billion in fiscal
2004. In addition, in November 2004, we paid $51 million in connection with the completion of the fiscal 2004 accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to continue to repurchase
shares as a means to manage dilution from the issuance of shares under employee benefit plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. During fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors of HP authorized an
additional $4.0 billion for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of October 31, 2005, we had remaining authorization of approximately $3.4 billion for
future share repurchases. 

LIQUIDITY  

        As previously discussed, we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity, since we believe that internally generated cash flows are
sufficient to support business operations, capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases. We are able to
supplement this near term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions. 

        We
maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including
acquisitions), share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital. Outstanding debt remained at $5.2 billion as of October 31, 2006 as compared to October 31, 2005,
bearing weighted average interest rates of 5.1% and 4.7%, respectively. Short-term borrowings increased to $2.7 billion at October 31, 2006 from $1.8 billion at
October 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to the reclassification from long-term to short-term of $2.0 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes, of which
$1.0 billion matured in December 2006 and $1.0 billion will mature in July 2007. This increase was offset partially by the repayment of $200 million Series A
Medium-Term Notes in December 2005 and 750 million Euro Medium-Term Notes in July 2006, as well as a
decrease of $18 million in commercial paper. During fiscal 2006, we both issued and repaid approximately $5.4 billion of commercial paper. As of October 31, 2006, we had
$16.4 million in total borrowings collateralized by certain financing receivable assets. 

        HP,
and not the HPFS financing business, issued the vast majority of our total outstanding debt. Like other financial services companies, HPFS has a business model that is
asset-intensive in nature and therefore is more debt-dependent than our other business segments. At October 31, 2006, HPFS had approximately $7.2 billion in net portfolio
assets, which included short-and long-term financing receivables and operating lease assets. 

        We
have revolving trade receivables-based facilities permitting us to sell certain trade receivables to third parties on a non-recourse basis. The aggregate maximum capacity
under these programs was approximately $477 million as of October 31, 2006 and there was approximately $150 million available under these programs. In fiscal 2006, we had another
facility that was subject to a maximum amount of 525 million euros (the "Euro Program"), which was terminated on October 31, 2006. We sold approximately $8.6 billion of trade
receivables during fiscal 2006, including approximately $5.9 billion 

64




 


under
the Euro Program. Fees associated with these facilities do not generally differ materially from the cash discounts offered to these customers under the previous alternative prompt payment
programs. 

        We
have the following short-term or long-term financings available, if we need additional liquidity:

        In
May 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to enable us to offer and sell from time to time, in one or more
offerings, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. On May 23, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion in Floating Rate Global Notes under this registration
statement. We used a portion of the proceeds received to repay our 5.25% Euro Medium-Term Notes due July 2006 at maturity. We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general
corporate purposes. 

        The
securities issuable under the 2002 shelf registration statement include notes with due dates of nine months or more from issuance. The lines of credit are uncommitted and are
available primarily through various foreign subsidiaries. In April 2005, we increased our U.S. commercial paper program to $6.0 billion. 

        We
have a $3.0 billion U.S. credit facility expiring in December 2010. This credit facility is a senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangement primarily to support our
U.S. commercial paper program. Our ability to have a U.S. commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the $3.0 billion committed credit facility is subject to a number of factors,
including liquidity conditions and business performance. 

        Our
credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them.
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings currently rate our senior unsecured long
term debt A-, A3 and A and our short-term debt A-1, Prime-1, and F1, respectively. We do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate
the maturity of a material amount of our debt. However, a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities. Also, a downgrade in our credit rating could
limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs. If this occurs, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including our
credit facility or the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statements and our Euro Medium-Term Note Programme. 

        On
December 15, 2006, we repaid our $1.0 billion Global Notes due December 2006 at maturity.

(1)Amounts
represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts. Included in our
long-term debt are approximately $52 million of capital lease obligations that are secured by certain equipment.
(2)Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable
without penalty. These purchase obligations are related principally to cost of sales, inventory and other items. Our purchase obligation includes the settlement agreement with EMC Corporation ("EMC")
pursuant to which we agreed to pay $325 million (the net amount of the valuation of EMC's claims against us less the valuation of our claims against EMC) to EMC, which we can satisfy through
the purchase for resale or internal use of complementary EMC products in equal installments of $65 million over the next five years, of which the first installment was paid on August 29,
2005. As of October 31, 2006, the remaining payment to EMC was $260 million. In addition, if EMC purchases our products during the five-year period, we will be required to
purchase an equivalent amount of additional products or services from EMC of up to an aggregate of $108 million. 


        In
November 2006, we completed our acquisition of Mercury. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, consisting of cash paid for outstanding stock, the
value of vested employee stock options and estimated direct transaction costs. The acquisition will combine Mercury's application management, application delivery and IT governance capabilities with
our broad portfolio of management solutions. 

Funding Commitments  

        During fiscal 2006, we made approximately $270 million and $31 million of contributions to our pension plans and U.S. non-qualified plan
participants, respectively, and paid $67 million to cover benefit claims for post-retirement benefit plans. In fiscal 2007, we expect to contribute approximately $120 million
to our pension plans and approximately $15 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. We expect to pay approximately $80 million to cover
benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. Our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as
established by local government and 

66




 


funding
and taxing authorities. We expect to use contributions made to the post-retirement plans primarily for the payment of retiree health claims incurred during the fiscal year. 

        We
will make a significant cash payment associated with our fiscal 2006 bonus programs. The bonus programs are designed to reward our employees upon achievement of annual performance
objectives. Bonuses are calculated based on a formula, with targets that are set at the beginning of each fiscal year. Both the formula and the targets are approved by our Board of Directors. 

        In
fiscal 2006, we substantially outperformed against our targets which will result in a bonus payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 that will be significantly larger than prior
years, resulting in a corresponding reduction in cash flow from operations in that quarter. This bonus was accrued and expensed, as earned, throughout fiscal 2006. 

        Also
reducing our cash flow from operation in fiscal 2007 will be significant payments associated with our restructuring plans. As a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect
future cash expenditures of approximately $640 million. The majority of this amount is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2006. We expect to make cash payments of
approximately $549 million in fiscal 2007 and the remaining amount of approximately $91 million over the next five fiscal years. 


Pending Acquisitions  

        In December 2006, we agreed to acquire Knightsbridge Solutions Holdings Corporation, a privately held services company specializing in the information
management areas of business intelligence, data warehousing, data integration and information quality. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed during
our first quarter of fiscal 2007. 

        Also
in December 2006, we agreed to acquire Bitfone Corporation, a privately held global software and services company that develops software solutions for mobile device
management for the wireless industry. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed by February 2007. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

        As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of October 31, 2006, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated SPEs. 


Indemnifications  

        In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third-party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnifications have been
immaterial.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        


        In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position
and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage
existing underlying exposures of HP. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of
changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below. 


        Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges. 

Foreign currency exchange rate risk  

        We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets, liabilities and debt
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to our operations for fiscal 2006 were the euro, the
Japanese yen and the British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S.
dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone. We use a combination of forward contracts and
options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S.
dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. We recognize the gains and losses on
foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the foreign
currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures if such exposure acts as a natural foreign
currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge. 

        We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2006 and 2005, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset
by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2006 and 2005. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $104 million at October 31, 2006 and $90 million at
October 31, 2005. 

Interest rate risk  

        We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables. We issue long-term debt in either
U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We then typically use interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to
achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating 

68




 


interest
payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be
beneficial. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We
may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert
variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns. 

        We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2006 and 2005, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investment instruments, financing receivables and
interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables. The discount rates we used were based on
the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2006 and 2005. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the
fair values of our debt and investment instruments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swap positions, of $19 million at October 31, 2006 and $4 million at
October 31, 2005. 

Equity price risk  

        We are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities, which had an estimated fair value of $36 million
at October 31, 2006 and $64 million at October 31, 2005. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity
investment exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. Generally, we do not attempt to reduce or
eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities. However, we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time. We do not purchase our equity securities with the
intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our
marketable equity securities of $11 million at October 31, 2006 and $19 million at October 31, 2005. The aggregate cost of privately-held companies and other
investments is $362 million at October 31, 2006 and $353 million at October 31, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm        

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Hewlett-Packard Company  

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 

        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. 

        As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2006, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in
accordance with guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment".

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm        

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Hewlett-Packard Company  

        We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Hewlett-Packard
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hewlett-Packard Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 


        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        In
our opinion, management's assessment that Hewlett-Packard Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Hewlett-Packard Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
October 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard
Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2006 and our report dated December 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        

        HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of HP's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of October 31, 2006. HP management's assessment of the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 72 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements        

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  



 Principles of Consolidation  



        The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled majority-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, "HP"). HP accounts for equity investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling interest, under the
equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP has eliminated all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions. 



 Reclassifications and Segment Reorganization  



        HP has made certain organizational realignments in order to more closely align its financial reporting with its business structure. These realignments are
immaterial in size and reflect primarily revenue shifts among business units within the same business segment. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings
from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share. 

        HP
has revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 to provide improved visibility and comparability
with the current year presentation. This change does not affect previously reported subtotals within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or previously reported results of operations for any
period presented. 



 Use of Estimates  



        The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 



 Revenue Recognition  



        HP recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, HP allocates revenue to
each element based on its relative fair value, or for software, based on vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first
allocates revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. Where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined, HP defers
revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered. HP limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future
delivery of products or services or subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges. 


        HP
ceases revenue recognition on delinquent accounts based upon a number of factors, including customer credit history, number of days past due and the terms of the customer agreement.
HP resumes revenue recognition and recognizes any associated deferred revenue when appropriate customer actions are taken to remove accounts from delinquent status. 

78




 



 Products  



        Under HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and revenue
is recognized accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other offerings
that occur under sales programs established by HP directly or with HP's distributors and resellers. HP uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license
term when VSOE for all undelivered elements, such as Post Contract Support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under
sales-type leases as product revenue at the inception of the lease. HP accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties, based on
historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue. 



 Services  



        HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-customer support
contracts, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue and costs as services are
rendered. HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price consulting arrangements over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual labor costs incurred
to date to the estimated total contract labor costs, with estimates regularly revised during the life of the contract. For outsourcing contracts, HP recognizes revenue ratably over the contractual
service period for fixed price contracts and on the output or consumption basis for all other outsourcing contracts. HP recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such
costs relate to the transition phase of the outsourcing contract, in which case HP generally amortizes those costs over the contractual service period. In addition, under the provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," if the revenue for a delivered item is not recognized because it is not separable from the
outsourcing arrangement, then HP also defers the cost of the delivered item. HP recognizes both the revenue and associated cost for the delivered item ratably over the remaining contractual service
period. HP recognizes losses on consulting and outsourcing arrangements in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable. HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of
revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed-price contracts as trade
receivables. HP recognizes revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period. 



 Financing Income  



        Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the lease term. 



 Shipping and Handling  



        HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of sales for all periods presented. 



 Advertising  



        HP expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2006,
$1.1 billion in fiscal 2005 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2004. 

79




 


 Taxes on Earnings  



        HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. 



 Cash and Cash Equivalents  



        HP classifies investments as cash equivalents if the maturity of an investment is three months or less from the purchase date. Interest income was approximately
$623 million in fiscal 2006, $424 million in fiscal 2005 and $238 million in fiscal 2004. 



 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  



        HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. HP maintains bad debt
reserves based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions,
significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors and
the financial condition of customers. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, HP would further adjust estimates of the recoverability of
receivables. 



 Inventory  



        HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. 



 Property, Plant and Equipment  



        HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions, improvements and major renewals. HP expenses maintenance,
repairs and minor renewals as incurred. HP provides depreciation using straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are 5 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements
over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. 



 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets  



        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), prohibits the amortization of
goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. HP reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually at the beginning of its fourth
fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS 142. For goodwill, HP performs a
two-step impairment test. In the first step, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. HP determines the fair value of its reporting units based on a
weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, HP calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. 

80




 

Under
the market approach, HP estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of
the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the
reporting unit, then HP must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, HP records an impairment loss equal to the difference. 

        SFAS 142
also requires that the fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets be estimated and compared to the carrying value. HP estimates the fair value of
these intangible assets using an income approach. HP recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value. 



 Long-Lived Assets Including Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets  



        HP amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging
from one to ten years. 

        HP
evaluates long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." HP
assesses the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow
expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When HP identifies an impairment, HP
reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. 



 Capitalized Software  



        HP capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system
interfaces and installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from one
to three years. 



 Derivative Financial Instruments  



        HP uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. HP also may use
other derivative instruments not designated as hedges such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. See Note 9 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies, which is incorporated herein by reference. 



 Investments  



        HP's investments consist principally of time deposits, other debt securities, money market securities and equity securities of publicly-traded and
privately-held companies. HP classifies investments with maturities of less than one year as short-term investments. 

81




 

        HP
classifies its investments in debt securities and its equity investments in public companies as available-for-sale securities and carries them at fair value.
HP determines fair values for investments in public companies using quoted market prices. HP records the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of
taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

        HP
carries equity investments in privately-held companies at the lower of cost or fair value. HP may estimate fair values for investments in privately-held
companies based upon one or more of the following: pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information and current market rates; liquidation values; the values of recent rounds of
financing; and quoted market prices of comparable public companies. 



 Losses on Investments  



        HP monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the
decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, HP records an impairment charge and establishes a new cost basis for the investment at its current fair value. In
order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, HP evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the
carrying value; the financial condition of and business outlook for the company, including key operational and cash flow metrics, current market conditions and future trends in the company's industry;
the company's relative competitive position within the industry; and HP's intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair
value. 

        HP
determined the declines in value of certain investments to be other-than-temporary. Accordingly, HP recorded impairments of
approximately $8 million in fiscal 2006, $43 million in fiscal 2005 and $26 million in fiscal 2004. HP includes these impairments in gains/(losses) on investments in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depending on market conditions, HP may record additional impairments on its investment portfolio in the future. 



 Concentrations of Credit Risk  



        Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
accounts receivable from trade customers and from contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives. 

        HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographical regions and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one institution. As part of its cash and risk management processes, HP
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. HP utilizes
forward contracts and other derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty,
which could result in a material loss. 

        HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors and resellers deteriorate substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller
receivable balances collectively, which were concentrated primarily in North America, represented approximately 21% of gross accounts 

82




 


receivable
at October 31, 2006 and 22% at October 31, 2005. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable
and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographical regions. HP
performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and requires collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in
certain circumstances. HP generally has experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in its emerging markets, in particular Asia Pacific and Latin America, compared to its United States
and European markets. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles in emerging markets significantly deteriorate or one or more of HP's larger resellers in these regions fail, HP's
operating results could be adversely affected. 



 Other Concentration  



        HP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a
single source supplier, the deterioration of its relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single
source supplier could adversely effect HP's revenue and gross margins. 



 Stock-Based Compensation  



        Effective November 1, 2005, HP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"
("SFAS 123R"), using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense in
fiscal 2006 included stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provision of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. HP recognizes these compensation
costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of four years. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, HP
recognized stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). In
March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") regarding the SEC's interpretation of SFAS 123R and the
valuation of share-based payments for public companies. HP has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R. 

        In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 123(R)-3, "Transition Election Related to
Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards" ("FSP 123R-3"). HP has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R-3 for
calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional
paid-in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
further discussion on stock-based compensation. 

83




 



 Foreign Currency Transactions  



        HP uses the U.S. dollar predominately as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured into U.S.
dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities, and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, cost of sales and expenses are remeasured at
average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those net revenue, cost of sales and expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which HP remeasures at historical
exchange rates. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in net earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and HP records
the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). 



 Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans  



        HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of participants. The measurement date for all plans is September 30 for fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2005. See Note 15 for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies, which is incorporated herein by reference. 



 Recent Pronouncements  



        In May 2005, FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" ("SFAS 154"), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20
"Accounting Changes" and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28." SFAS 154 provides guidance on
the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in
accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact. 

        In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying FIN 48 will be
recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated
results of operations and financial condition and is not yet in a position to determine such effects. 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. It also responds to investors' requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair
value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or 

84




 


liabilities
to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition and is not yet in a position to determine such effects. 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87,
88, 106 and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company's balance sheet, and changes in the funded
status be reflected in
comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, which HP expects to adopt effective October 31, 2007. SFAS also requires companies to measure the funded
status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. HP expects to adopt the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 effective
October 31, 2009. Based upon the October 31, 2006 balance sheet and pension disclosures, the impact of adopting SFAS 158 is estimated to be a decrease in assets of
$821 million, a decrease in liabilities of $4 million and a pretax increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $817 million. The effect of adoption will differ from
the estimate due to actual plan asset and liability experience in fiscal 2007. 

        In
September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements"
("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company's balance sheet and statement of operations
and the related financial statement disclosures. Early application of the guidance in SAB 108 is encouraged in any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after
November 15, 2006, and will be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. HP does not expect the adoption of SAB 108 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition. 

        In
addition, HP is reviewing the following Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") consensuses and does not currently expect that the adoption of these will have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition: 



•EITF
05-5, "Accounting for Early Retirement or Postemployment Programs with Specific Features (Such as Terms Specified in Altersteilzeit Early Retirement Arrangements."
Issued in June 2005 and effective for HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, this EITF applies to early retirement programs which create incentives for employees, within a specific age group, to
transition from full or part-time employment to retirement before legal retirement age.
•EITF
06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits." Issued in June 2006 and effective for HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, this EITF applies to
compensated absences that require a minimum service period but have no increase in the benefit even with additional years of service.
•EITF
06-9, "Reporting a Change in (or the Elimination of) a Previously Existing Difference between the Fiscal Year End of a Parent Company and That of a Consolidated Entity
or between the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee." Issued in November 2006 and effective for HP in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, this EITF requires certain
disclosures whenever a change is made to modify or eliminate the time lag (usually three 

85




 



months
or less) used for recording results of consolidated entities or equity method investees that have a different fiscal year end than HP's. 




        In
fiscal 2006, HP adopted FSP No. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments"
("FSP 115-1"). This adoption did not have a material impact on HP's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation  

        At October 31, 2006, HP has the stock-based employee compensation plans described below. The total compensation expense before taxes related to these plans
was $536 million in fiscal 2006, excluding a $14 million credit adjustment in restructuring charges as disclosed below. Prior to November 1, 2005, HP accounted for those plans
under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, HP generally recognized compensation expense only when it granted options with a discounted exercise price. Any resulting
compensation expense was recognized ratably over the associated service period, which was generally the option vesting term. 

        Prior
to November 1, 2005, HP provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), as if the fair value method defined by SFAS 123 had been applied to its stock-based compensation. 

        Effective
November 1, 2005, HP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated
prior periods' results. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 included compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of, November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. HP recognizes these
compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation costs for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period of the award, which is generally the
option vesting term of four years. HP estimated the forfeiture rate in fiscal 2006 based on its historical experience for fiscal grant years where the majority of the vesting terms have been
satisfied. 

        As
a result of adopting SFAS 123R, earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2006 and net earnings in fiscal 2006 were lower by $448 million and $318 million,
respectively, than if we had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 was $0.11 per share. In addition,
prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, HP presented the tax benefit of stock option exercises as operating cash flows. Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, the tax benefit resulting from tax
deductions in excess of the tax benefit related to compensation cost recognized for those options are classified as financing cash flows.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

        HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, also known as the Share Ownership Plan (the "ESPP"), pursuant to which eligible
employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock. Prior to November 1, 2005, employees were able to purchase
stock semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value at certain plan-defined dates. As of November 1, 2005, HP changed the ESPP so that employees will
purchase stock semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Since the price of the shares is now determined at the purchase date and there is no
longer a look-back period, HP recognizes the expense based on the 15% discount at purchase. In fiscal 2006, ESPP compensation expense was $53 million, net of taxes. At
October 31, 2006, approximately 147,000 employees were eligible to participate and approximately 53,000 employees were participants in the ESPP. In fiscal 2006, participants purchased
11,076,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $30 per share. In fiscal 2005, participants purchased 20,673,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $17 per
share. In fiscal 2004, participants purchased 25,868,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $14 per share. 


Incentive Compensation Plans  

        HP stock option plans include principal plans adopted in 2004, 2000, 1995 and 1990 ("principal option plans"), as well as various stock option plans assumed
through acquisitions under which stock options are outstanding. All regular employees meeting limited employment qualifications were eligible to receive stock options in fiscal 2006. There were
approximately 110,000 employees holding options under one or more of the option plans as of October 31, 2006. Options granted under the principal option plans are generally
non-qualified stock options, but the principal option plans permit some options granted to qualify as "incentive stock options" under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The 

87




 


exercise
price of a stock option is equal to the fair market value of HP's common stock on the option grant date (as determined by the average of the highest and lowest reported sale prices of HP's
common stock on that date). The contractual term of options granted since fiscal 2003 was generally eight years, while the contractual term of options granted prior to fiscal 2003 was generally ten
years. Under the principal option plans, HP may choose, in certain cases, to establish a discounted exercise price at no less than 75% of fair market value on the grant date. HP has not granted any
discounted options since fiscal 2003. 

        Under
the principal option plans, HP granted certain employees cash, restricted stock awards, or both. Restricted stock awards are nonvested stock awards that may include grants of
restricted stock or grants of restricted stock units. Cash and restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the
release of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During that period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same cash
dividend and voting rights as other common stock and is considered to be currently issued and outstanding. Restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights equal to the cash dividend paid on
restricted stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying the restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding. HP expenses the
cost of the restricted stock awards, which HP has determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. In fiscal
2006, HP granted 1,492,000 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $32. In fiscal 2005, HP granted 6,773,000 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average
grant date fair value of $21. HP had 5,492,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2006, 7,099,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2005 and
1,533,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2004. In fiscal 2006, HP granted 33,000 shares of restricted stock units with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $30. In
fiscal 2005, HP granted 1,820,000 shares of restricted stock units with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $21. HP had restricted stock units covering 873,000 shares outstanding at
October 31, 2006, 1,780,000 shares outstanding at October 31, 2005 and no shares outstanding at October 31, 2004. 

        In
light of new accounting guidance under SFAS 123R, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 HP reevaluated its assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee
options granted. As part of this assessment, management determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded
options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility. Therefore, expected volatility in fiscal 2006 and 2005 was based on a
market-based implied volatility. 

        As
part of its SFAS 123R adoption, HP also examined its historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on
certain employee populations. From this analysis, HP identified three employee populations. HP used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the options for each of the employee populations.
The table below presents the weighted average expected life in months of the combined three identified employee populations. The expected life computation is based on historical exercise patterns and
post-vesting termination behavior within each of the three populations identified. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between HP's closing stock price on the last trading day of
fiscal 2006 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their
options on October 31, 2006. This amount changes based on the fair market value of HP's stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2006 was $1,190 million. Total fair
value of options vested and expensed in fiscal 2006 was $265 million, net of taxes.

        As
of October 31, 2006, $677 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.30 years. 

        Cash
received from option exercises and purchases under the ESPP in fiscal 2006 was $2,538 million. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of
the share-based payment awards in fiscal 2006 totaled $420 million.

        As
of October 31, 2006, there was $90 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.46 years. 

        In
fiscal 2006, HP recorded $58 million of stock-based compensation expense, net of taxes, relating to options assumed through acquisitions and restricted stock awards. HP
recorded $144 million and $33 million of stock-based compensation expense, net of taxes, relating to options assumed through acquisitions and restricted stock awards in fiscal years 2005
and 2004, respectively. 

        In
fiscal 2006, HP allocated stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP and the principal option plans under SFAS 123R as follows:

        In
addition, as part of its fiscal 2005 restructuring plans, HP accelerated the vesting on options held by terminated employees and included a one-year
post-termination exercise period on the options. This modification resulted in compensation expense of $107 million that HP included in the restructuring charges. In fiscal 2006, an
adjustment of $14 million was recorded as a reduction to the $107 million restructuring charges to reflect actual stock-based compensation expense related to employees who left the
company. 

        Stock-based
compensation expense recognized under incentive compensation plans was approximately $522 million in fiscal 2006 (including the $14 million credit in
restructuring charges referred to above), $211 million in fiscal 2005 (including the $107 million in restructuring charges referred to above), and $48 million in fiscal 2004.

Shares Reserved  

        Shares available for the ESPP and stock-based compensation plans were 217,556,000 at October 31, 2006, including 39,151,000 shares under the assumed Compaq
plans, 260,669,000 at October 31, 2005, including 32,449,000 shares under the assumed Compaq plans; and 257,554,000 at October 31, 2004, including 29,123,000 shares under the assumed
Compaq plans. 

        HP
had 664,267,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2006, 794,750,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2005, and 808,855,000 shares of common
stock reserved at October 31, 2004 for future issuance under all stock-related benefit plans. Additionally, HP had 21,494,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2006, 2005,
and 2004 for future issuances related to conversion of its outstanding zero-coupon subordinated notes. 


Note 3: Net Earnings Per Share ("EPS")  

        HP calculates basic EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS includes the effect from
potential issuance of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and the assumed conversion of convertible notes. 

        The

        In
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, HP excluded options with exercise prices that were greater than the average market price for HP's common stock to purchase approximately
130 million, 255 million and 408 million, respectively, shares from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect was anti-dilutive. Also, as a result of
adopting SFAS 123R on November 1, 2005, HP excluded an additional

48 million
options in fiscal 2006, whose combined exercise price, unamortized fair value and excess tax benefit were greater than the average market price for HP's common stock as these shares
were also anti-dilutive. In addition, HP excluded approximately 8 million shares of HP stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of zero-coupon subordinated notes from
the calculation of diluted EPS in fiscal 2005 because the effect was antidilutive.

has revolving trade receivables based facilities permitting it to sell certain trade receivables to third parties on a non-recourse basis. The aggregate maximum capacity
under these programs was approximately $477 million as of October 31, 2006 and there was approximately $150 million available under these programs. In fiscal 2006, HP had another
facility that was subject to a maximum amount of 525 million euros (the "Euro Program"), which was terminated on October 31, 2006. HP sold approximately $8.6 billion of trade
receivables during fiscal 2006, including approximately $5.9 billion under the Euro Program. Fees associated with these facilities do not generally differ materially from the cash discounts
offered to these customers under the previous alternative prompt payment programs.

Note 6: Acquisitions  

        HP has recorded acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, included the results of operations in HP's consolidated results as of the
date of each acquisition. HP allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and
development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations
using management's estimates and assumptions. HP does not expect goodwill recorded on a majority of these acquisitions to be deductible for tax purposes. 



 Peregrine  



        On December 19, 2005, HP acquired the outstanding shares of Peregrine Systems, Inc. ("Peregrine") in a cash merger for $26.08 per share. The
purchase price was approximately $538 million, consisting of $442 million of cash paid, which includes direct transaction costs, as well as the assumption of certain liabilities in
connection with the transaction. The acquisition of Peregrine adds key asset and service management components to the HP OpenView portfolio, a distributed management software suite for business
operations and IT. In connection with this acquisition, HP recorded approximately $342 million of goodwill and $162 million of amortizable intangible assets. HP also expensed
$34 million for IPR&D. HP is amortizing the purchased intangibles, principally customer relationships and developed technology, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives ranging from five to six years.

 Other Acquisitions in fiscal 2006  



        HP also completed seven other acquisitions during fiscal 2006. Total consideration for these acquisitions and the buyout of a minority interest was approximately
$473 million, which included direct transaction costs. The largest of these transactions was the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Scitex Vision Ltd ("Scitex"). The
Scitex asset acquisition is expected to expand HP's leadership in printing into the industrial wide-format market. 

        HP
recorded approximately $193 million of goodwill and $205 million of purchased intangibles in connection with these other acquisitions. HP also recorded approximately
$18 million of IPR&D related to these acquisitions in fiscal 2006. 


        In
addition, HP paid approximately $17 million for the balance of the outstanding shares of Digital Globalsoft Limited, a consolidated subsidiary of HP ("DGS"), and as a result
increased HP's ownership from 98.5% to 100%. This subsidiary has enhanced HP's capability in IT services, including expertise in life cycle services such as migration, technical and application
services. 

        HP
has included the results of operations of these transactions prospectively from the respective date of the transaction. HP has not presented the pro forma results of operations of the
acquired businesses
because the results are not material to HP's results of operations on either an individual or an aggregate basis. 



 Mercury Acquisition  



        On November 2, 2006, HP completed its tender offer for Mercury Interactive Corporation ("Mercury"), a leading IT management software and services company,
and acquired approximately 96% of Mercury shares for cash consideration of $52 per common share. On November 6, 2006, HP acquired the remaining outstanding shares, and Mercury became a wholly
owned subsidiary of HP. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, consisting of cash paid for outstanding stock, the value of vested employee stock options and estimated
direct transaction costs. The acquisition will combine Mercury's application management, application delivery and IT governance capabilities with HP's broad portfolio of management solutions. 

        The
acquisition will be recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the results of operations will be included in HP's consolidated results as of the acquisition
date. The purchase price will be allocated to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. These fair values will be determined based on
independent third-party valuations and management estimates which have not yet been completed. The excess purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. The goodwill will not be
deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets consist primarily of developed and core technologies, customer relationships, maintenance agreements and IPR&D. The IPR&D will be expensed in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2007. The remaining intangibles will be amortized over their estimated useful lives, currently estimated to range from three to seven years. Pro forma
results of operations have not been presented as these results are not material to HP's consolidated results of operations. 

        Management
is currently assessing and formulating product roadmap decisions and integration plans which may result in additional costs, including asset impairments and costs to terminate
or relocate employees. Exit costs related to Mercury activities and employees will be accrued by HP as a liability in conjunction with recording the purchase of Mercury, which will result in an
increase to 

96




 


goodwill.
In addition, HP will incur charges related to payments to Mercury executive officers and key employees under a retention plan adopted in connection with the acquisition, as well as costs
related to integration efforts. 



 Pending Acquisitions  



        In December 2006, HP agreed to acquire Knightsbridge Solutions Holdings Corporation, a privately held services company specializing in the information
management areas of business intelligence, data warehousing, data integration and information quality. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed during
the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Upon completion, the business is expected to be fully integrated into HP Services. 

        Also
in December 2006, HP agreed to acquire Bitfone Corporation, a privately held global software and services company that develops software solutions for mobile device
management for the wireless industry. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed by February 2007. Following the close of the acquisition, the
business is expected to be fully integrated into the Handheld Business Unit of HP's Personal Systems Group. 



 Acquisitions in fiscal 2005  



        In fiscal 2005, HP acquired five companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $648 million, which includes direct transaction costs and
certain liabilities recorded in connection with these acquisitions. The largest of these transactions were the acquisitions of SAC, LLC, doing business as "Snapfish," and AppIQ, Inc. ("AppIQ"),
which HP completed on April 15, 2005 and October 24, 2005, respectively. 

        Snapfish
is a leading online photo service. The acquisition of Snapfish enables HP to capitalize on the growing market for online photo printing, with customers benefiting from a more
affordable, simpler and more comprehensive digital photography experience. 

        AppIQ
is a leading provider of open storage area network management and storage resource management solutions. The acquisition of AppIQ strengthens HP's ability to give customers a
single integrated console that controls and better manages their storage and server infrastructure. 

        HP
recorded approximately $537 million of goodwill and $108 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets in connection with these five acquisitions. HP also recorded
approximately $2 million of IPR&D charges related to these five acquisitions. 

        In
fiscal 2005, HP paid approximately $8 million in cash for additional shares of DGS, a consolidated subsidiary of HP, to increase HP's ownership from approximately 97.2% to
approximately 98.5%. HP recorded approximately $7 million and $281 million of goodwill in connection with the share purchases in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

        The
goodwill adjustments for acquisitions made prior to fiscal 2006, as shown above, related primarily to revisions of acquisition-related tax and other estimates for all acquisitions
and the reduction of a restructuring liability associated with restructuring plans of Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq") prior to its acquisition by HP. These reductions resulted from adjusting
original estimates to actual costs incurred at various locations throughout the world. 

        Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2006 or August 1, 2005. However, future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in
circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

        Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of the Compaq trade name existed as of August 1, 2006 or August 1, 2005. However,

fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment. 

        The
finite-lived purchased intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements, which have weighted average useful lives of approximately eight
years, and developed and core technology, patents and product trademarks, which have weighted average useful lives of approximately six years.

Note 8: Restructuring Charges  



 Fiscal 2005 Restructuring Plans  



        In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, HP's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to simplify HP's structure, reduce costs and place greater
focus on its customers. HP included original estimates of 15,300 positions in the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan. Subsequent to the initial estimate, HP reduced the number of total positions to
15,200. The initial charge for these actions totaled $1.6 billion. After completion of HP's voluntary severance programs in Europe and Asia, total charges in connection with this plan, coupled
with other final adjustments, are expected to exceed the original charge by $108 million. During fiscal 2006, HP recognized charges of approximately $167 million relating to employee
severance and other benefits charges, including adjustment related to reduce non-cash stock-based compensation by $14 million. HP also recognized a $6 million termination
benefit expense and a $3 million settlement and curtailment loss from the non-U.S. pension plans. These charges were offset by settlement gains of $46 million from the U.S. pension plans
and
curtailment gains of $24 million from the U.S. retiree medical program. The $167 million of severance related charge was reflective of higher population of employees participating in
higher cost early retirement and voluntary programs with the greatest impact in Europe. 

        The
charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 included approximately $400 million related to employee severance and other benefits associated with the early retirement of 3,200
U.S. employees who left HP by October 31, 2005. The majority of these costs were funded by HP's pension plan assets. The remaining charges of approximately $1.2 billion, which include
approximately $100 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, are related to severance and other benefits for approximately 

99




 


12,000
employees. Pursuant to the plan, approximately 9,500 positions were eliminated during fiscal 2006, bringing the total to 14,200 as of October 31, 2006. The majority of the remaining
1,000 positions are expected to be eliminated during fiscal 2007. HP expects to pay out the majority of the remaining costs relating to severance and other employee benefits before the end of fiscal
2007. 

        In
the third quarter of fiscal 2005, HP's management approved a restructuring plan and HP recorded restructuring charges of $109 million related to severance and related costs
associated with the termination of approximately 1,450 employees, all of whom left HP as of October 31, 2005. Of the initial restructuring amount, HP has paid substantially all of it as of
October 31, 2006. 



 Fiscal 2005 Workforce Rebalancing  



        In addition to the restructuring activities described above, HP incurred approximately $236 million for the six months ended April 30, 2005 in
workforce rebalancing charges within certain business segments, primarily for severance and related costs. As a result of these workforce rebalancing actions, approximately 3,000 employees left HP as
of October 31, 2005. Of the initial restructuring amount, HP has paid substantially all of it as of October 31, 2006. 



 Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Plans  



        During fiscal 2006, HP recorded adjustments of $4 million in additional restructuring charges. Of the initial restructuring amount of $752 million,
HP has paid substantially all of it as of October 31, 2006. 



 Fiscal 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Plans  



        The 2002 and 2001 restructuring plans are substantially complete, although HP records minor revisions to previous estimates as necessary. During fiscal 2006, HP
recorded additional adjustments of $48 million. These charges pertained to facility lease obligations and severance. In addition, an adjustment during fiscal 2006 includes a $25 million
reduction of goodwill pertaining to severance and other related restructuring true-ups. The aggregate $103 million restructuring liability with respect to these plans as of
October 31, 2006 relates primarily to facility lease obligations and severance. HP expects to pay out these obligations over the life of the related obligations, which extend to the end of
fiscal 2010.

        Corporate
debt consists primarily of loans to the other companies that are guaranteed by standby letters of credit issued by third party banks. Other debt securities consist primarily of
fixed-interest securities invested for early retirement purposes as required by German laws. Equity securities in public companies are primarily common stock. 


        HP
estimated the fair values based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values that could
have been realized as of year-end or that will be realized in the future. 

        The
gross unrealized losses as of October 31, 2006 were associated with other debt securities with a fair value of $18 million and had been in a continuous loss position
for fewer than 12 months. The gross unrealized losses as of October 31, 2005 were associated with investments in public equity securities with a fair value of $10 million and had
been in a continuous loss position for fewer than 12 months.

$31 million and $1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005. Gross realized gains and losses totaled $27 million and $4 million, respectively, in fiscal 2004. The specific
identification method is used to account for gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.

investments consist primarily of marketable securities held to generate returns that HP expects to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation
arrangements. HP includes gains or losses from changes in fair value of these securities, offset by losses or gains on the related liabilities, in interest and other, net, in HP's Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. The balance consists of cost basis and equity method investments. 



 Derivative Financial Instruments  



        HP is a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of
its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, swaps and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. HP's objective is to offset
gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and
liabilities. HP does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. HP applies hedge accounting based upon the criteria established by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), whereby HP designates its derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
a foreign operation ("net investment hedges"). HP recognizes all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and reports them in other current assets, long-term financing
receivables and other assets, other accrued liabilities, and other liabilities. HP classifies cash flows from the derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. 



 Fair Value Hedges  



        HP may enter into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to both interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. HP issues
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP may then use interest rate or cross currency swaps to modify the market
risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense and to manage exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The swap
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments, and, when the underlying debt is denominated in a foreign currency, exchange of the foreign currency principal and
interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a
larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. HP may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with its foreign currency denominated debt if this debt acts as a natural
hedge for foreign currency assets denominated in the same currency. When investing in fixed rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest returns into
variable interest returns and would classify these swaps as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item in interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the current period. When HP terminates an
interest rate swap before maturity, the resulting gain or loss from the termination is amortized over the remaining life of the underlying hedged item.

 Cash Flow Hedges  



        HP may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income HP receives on certain variable-rate investments. HP may enter
into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns. For interest rate swaps that HP designates and that qualify as cash flow hedges, HP
records changes in the fair values in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassifies such changes into earnings in the period
during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. 

        HP
uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue
and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within six months. However, certain leasing
revenue-related forward contracts extend for the duration of the lease term, which can be up to five years. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially
records the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassifies
these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item
as the changes in value of the hedged item. As of October 31, 2006, amounts related to derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges amounted to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of
$46 million, net of taxes, of which $45 million is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted
transactions. In addition, during fiscal 2006 and 2005 HP did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. 



 Net Investment Hedges  



        HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local
currency. For derivative instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, HP records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument together with changes in the hedged
items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Cumulative translation adjustment decreased as result of an unrecognized net loss on net investment hedges
of $31 million and $56 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 



 Other Derivatives  



        Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 consist primarily of forward contracts HP uses to hedge foreign currency balance
sheet exposures. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133, HP recognizes changes in the fair values in earnings in the period of change. HP recognizes the
gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in interest and other, net in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities. Interest and other, net, included net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $54 million in fiscal 2006, and gains of approximately
$70 million in fiscal 2005 and losses of approximately $142 million in fiscal 2004. 

104




 


 Hedge Effectiveness  



        For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged debt and investments with
the change in fair value of the derivative. For interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in the variable portion of the interest rate
swaps with the changes in expected interest income received due to the fluctuations in the LIBOR based interest rate. For foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net
investment hedges, HP measures effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP
recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2006, the
portion of hedging instruments' gains or losses excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value,
cash flow and net investment hedges was not material in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 

        HP
estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The
gross notional and fair market value of derivative financial instruments and the respective SFAS 133 classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows for the following fiscal

 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments  



        For certain of HP's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, financing receivables,
notes payable and short-term borrowings, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value
of HP's short-and long-term debt was approximately $5.1 billion at October 31, 2006, compared to a carrying value of $5.2 billion at that date. The estimated fair
value of the debt is based primarily on quoted market prices, as well as borrowing rates currently available to HP for bank loans with similar terms and maturities. 

Note 10: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases  

        Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the marketing of HP's and third-party products. These
receivables typically have terms from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from
operating leases. The components of net financing receivables, which are included in financing receivables and long-term financing receivables and other assets, were as follows for the

Note 11: Guarantees  



 Indemnifications  



        In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. 



 Warranty  



        HP provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service
delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation. If actual product
failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

        HP
may redeem some or all of the Global Notes and the Series A Medium-Term Notes (collectively, the "Notes"), as set forth in the above table, at any time at the
redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. The Notes are senior unsecured debt. 

        In
May 2006, HP filed a shelf registration statement (the "2006 Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC to enable HP to offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more
offerings, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. On May 23, 2006, HP issued $1.0 billion in Floating Rate Global Notes under this registration
statement. The Floating Rate Global Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.125% per annum. HP used a portion of the proceeds received to repay its 5.25% Euro
Medium-Term Notes due July 2006 at maturity and the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 

        HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of debt or global securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement in
March 2002 (the "2002 Shelf Registration Statement"). In December 2002, HP filed a supplement to the 2002 Shelf Registration Statement, which allows HP to offer from time to time up to
$1.5 billion of Medium-Term 

109




 


Notes,
Series B, due nine months or more from the date of issuance (the "Series B Medium-Term Note Program"). As of October 31, 2006, HP has not issued
Medium-Term Notes pursuant to the Series B Medium-Term Note Program. 

        HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of Medium-Term Notes under its Euro Medium-Term Note Programme filed with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. HP
can denominate these notes in any currency, including the euro. These notes have not been and will not be registered in the United States. In July 2006, HP repaid the previously issued
750 million euro notes at maturity under this programme. 

        The
LYONs are convertible by the holders at an adjusted rate of 15.09 shares of HP common stock for each $1,000 face value of the LYONs, payable in either cash or common stock at HP's
election. At any time, HP may redeem the LYONs at book value, payable in cash only. In December 2000, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for the LYONs that allowed HP to
repurchase the LYONs from time to time at varying prices. The last repurchase under this program occurred in fiscal 2002. 

        On
December 15, 2006, HP repaid $1.0 billion Global Notes due December 2006 at maturity. 

        HP
has a U.S. commercial paper program with a $6.0 billion capacity. Its subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to an additional $1.0 billion of commercial paper, of which
$500 million of capacity is currently available to be used by Hewlett-Packard International Bank PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP for its Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit
Programme. 

        Until
December 15, 2005, HP had two U.S. credit facilities consisting of a $1.5 billion 364-day credit facility expiring in March 2006 and a
$1.5 billion 5-year credit facility expiring in March 2009. The credit facilities were subject to a weighted average commitment fee of 7.25 basis points per annum. On
December 15, 2005, HP replaced the two credit facilities with a $3.0 billion 5-year credit facility that is subject to a commitment fee of 6.5 basis points per annum.
Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facility vary, based on HP's external credit ratings. The credit facility is a senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangement primarily
to support the issuance of U.S. commercial paper. No amounts are outstanding under the credit facility. 


        HP
also maintains lines of credit of approximately $2.1 billion from a number of financial institutions that are uncommitted and available through various foreign subsidiaries. 

        Included
in Other, including capital lease obligations, are borrowings that are collateralized by certain financing receivable assets. As of October 31, 2006, the carrying value
of the assets approximated the carrying value of the borrowings of $16.4 million. 

        At
October 31, 2006, HP had up to $12.5 billion of available borrowing resources under the 2002 Shelf Registration Statement and other programs described above. HP also may
issue additional debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement.

        At
October 31, 2006, HP had a deferred tax asset of $558 million related to loss carryforwards, of which $336 million relates to foreign net operating losses. HP has
provided a valuation allowance of $315 million on those foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which HP does not expect to utilize. The remaining $222 million deferred tax asset
relates to various state net operating losses and losses 

112




 


from
acquired companies. HP has provided $158 million in valuation allowance for such losses. In addition, HP has provided $86 million in valuation allowance on unrealized domestic
capital losses. 

        Of
the total tax credit carryforwards of $2.2 billion, HP had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.5 billion, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2012. HP had
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $92 million, which do not expire, and research and development credit carryforwards of $330 million, of which $24 million will
expire in fiscal 2013 and the remainder will expire after fiscal 2018. HP also had tax credit carryforwards of $363 million in various states and foreign countries, on which HP has provided a
valuation allowance of $281 million. 

        Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2006 and 2005 were reduced by valuation allowances of $840 million and $812 million, respectively. The total valuation
allowance increased by $28 million. This valuation allowance increase was comprised of a $95 million increase to acquired net operating losses and tax credits, which was partially offset by a decrease
in the valuation allowances of state net operating losses and tax credits of $25 million, foreign net operating losses and tax credits of $35 million, and other miscellaneous items of $7 million. Of
the $840 million in valuation allowances at October 31, 2006, $236 million was related to deferred tax assets for Compaq and other acquired companies that existed at the time of
acquisition. In the future, if HP determines that the realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not, the reversal of the related valuation allowance will reduce goodwill instead of
the provision for taxes. 

        Of
the total tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs, the amounts booked to stockholders' equity were approximately
$356 million in fiscal 2006, $30 million in fiscal 2005 and $35 million in fiscal 2004.

        In
fiscal 2006, HP recorded $599 million of net income tax benefit related to items unique to the year. This included net favorable tax adjustments of $565 million to
income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examinations of HP's U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998. The reductions to the net income
tax accruals for these years related
primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to Puerto Rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives, and other issues involving our non-U.S. operations. 


        In
December 2006, The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law, which includes a retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit. The retroactive
amount 

113




 


will
be recorded in HP's financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the quarter in which the Act was signed into law. While HP is still evaluating the Tax Relief and Health Care Act,
the retroactive research credit is not expected to have a material impact on HP's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 


        In
fiscal 2005, HP recorded $697 million of net income tax expense related to items unique to the year. The tax expense was the result primarily of $792 million associated
with the repatriation of $14.5 billion under the Jobs Act and $76 million related to additional distributions received from foreign subsidiaries. These tax expenses were offset in part
by tax benefits of $177 million resulting from agreements with the IRS and other governmental authorities, which were reflected in "Lower rates in other jurisdictions, net" and "Other, net." 

        In
fiscal 2004, the tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities of $207 million, which decreased the provision for taxes. The most
significant favorable adjustments related to the resolution of a California state income tax audit, a net favorable revision to estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2003 U.S. income tax return and a
reduction in taxes on foreign earnings due to a change in regulatory policy. These favorable adjustments were offset in part by the net effect of smaller adjustments to income tax liabilities in
various jurisdictions. 

        As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing activities of subsidiaries in certain countries is subject to reduced tax
rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes through fiscal 2019. The gross income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately
$876 million ($0.31 per diluted share) in fiscal 2006, $1,051 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in fiscal 2005 and $947 million ($0.31 per diluted share) in fiscal 2004. The gross
income tax benefits were offset partially by accruals of U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings. 

        The
IRS has completed its examination of the income tax returns of HP for all years through 1998. These years have been settled with the IRS's Appeals Division and the settlements have
been approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation. These tax years remain open for net operating loss and foreign tax credit carrybacks from subsequent years if the IRS's audits of those years approve
such carrybacks. As of October 31, 2006, the IRS was in the process of examining HP's income tax returns for years 1999 through 2003. HP expects that the IRS will begin an audit of its 2004 and
2005 income tax returns in
2007. In addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state and foreign tax authorities. HP believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all HP open tax years. 

        All
Compaq tax years through the merger date with HP, May 3, 2002, have been audited and agreed with the IRS. HP expects that substantially all of the remaining tax accruals for
Compaq will be reclassified as a reduction of goodwill during fiscal 2007 upon closing of the statute of limitations. 

        HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31,
2006 because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to
reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit non-indefinitely
reinvested earnings of its non-US subsidiaries where excess cash has accumulated and it determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash reasons.

 American Jobs Creation Act of 2004—Repatriation of Foreign Earnings  



        The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("the Jobs Act"), enacted on October 22, 2004, provided for a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain
foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005,
HP's CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the Jobs Act to repatriate $14.5 billion in foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. 

        HP
recorded tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $792 million related to this $14.5 billion dividend under the Jobs Act. The additional tax expense consists of federal taxes of
$744 million, state taxes, net of federal benefits, of $73 million, and a net tax benefit of $25 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on both repatriated
and unrepatriated foreign earnings. 

Note 14: Stockholders' Equity  



 Dividends  



        The stockholders of HP common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HP's Board of Directors. Dividends are paid quarterly. Dividends
were $0.32 per common share in each of fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. 



 Stock Repurchase Program  



        HP's share repurchase program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions. In fiscal 2006, HP completed share repurchases of approximately
188 million shares. Approximately 190 million shares were settled for $6.1 billion, which included 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal
2005 but settled in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, HP completed share repurchases of approximately 150 million shares, of which approximately 148 million shares were settled for
$3.5 billion. In fiscal 2004, HP completed share repurchases of approximately 172 million shares for $3.3 billion. Shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2006 were all open
market repurchases. Shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2005 included open market repurchases of 37 million shares for $1.0 billion and 111 million shares for
$2.5 billion from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation (the "Packard Foundation"). Shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2004 included open market repurchases of 66 million shares
for $1.3 billion, 72 million shares for $1.3 billion under an accelerated share repurchase program with an investment bank (the "Accelerated Purchase") and 34 million
shares for $679 million from the Packard Foundation. 

        In
addition to the above transactions, HP entered into a prepaid variable share purchase program ("PVSPP") with a third-party investment bank during the first quarter of 2006 and prepaid
$1.7 billion in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of its common stock weekly over a one year period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and ending during
the second quarter of fiscal 2007. HP recorded the payment as a prepaid stock repurchase in the stockholders' equity section of its Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the payment was included in the cash
flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with this program, the investment bank has purchased and will continue to trade shares of HP's common stock
in the open market over time. The prepaid funds will be expended ratably over the term of the program. 

115




 


        Under
the PVSPP, the prices at which HP purchases the shares are subject to a minimum and maximum price that was determined in advance of any repurchases being completed under the
program, thereby effectively hedging HP's repurchase price. The minimum and maximum number of shares HP could receive under the program are 52 million shares and 70 million shares,
respectively. The exact number of shares to be repurchased is based upon the volume weighted average market price of HP's shares during each weekly settlement period, subject to the minimum and
maximum price as well as regulatory limitations on the number of shares HP is permitted to repurchase. HP decreases its shares outstanding each settlement period as shares are physically received. HP
will retire all shares repurchased under the PVSPP, and HP will no longer deem those shares outstanding. In fiscal 2006, HP had received approximately 34 million shares for an aggregate price
of $1.1 billion under the PVSPP. 

        The
Accelerated Purchase began on September 2004 and was completed in November 2004. Upon completion of the Accelerated Purchase HP paid a $51 million price
adjustment based on the difference between the $18.82 weighted average price of the open market stock purchases by the investment bank and the initial purchase price of $18.11 per share. The price
adjustment also included certain amounts reflecting the investment bank's carrying costs or benefits from purchasing shares at prices other than the initial price and its benefits from receiving the
$1.3 billion payment in advance of its purchases. HP accounted for the Accelerated Purchase as an equity transaction on the cash settlement dates. 


        HP
repurchased shares from the Packard Foundation under a memorandum of understanding dated September 9, 2002 and amended and restated September 17, 2004 that, among other
things, priced the repurchases by reference to the volume weighted-average price for composite New York Stock Exchange transactions on trading days in which a repurchase occurred. Either HP or the
Packard Foundation may suspend or terminate sales under the amended and restated memorandum of understanding at any time. 

        HP's
Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion, $4.0 billion and $5.0 billion for future repurchases of outstanding common stock in fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. As of October 31, 2006, HP had remaining authorization of $5.6 billion for future share repurchases. Previously authorized share repurchases also will be made
under the PVSPP until the remaining available balance is exhausted in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Note 15: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans  



 Plan Design Changes  



        In conjunction with management's plan to restructure certain of its operations, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, HP
modified its U.S. retirement programs to align more closely to industry practice. Effective January 1, 2006, HP no longer offers U.S. defined benefit pension plans and subsidized retiree
medical programs to new U.S. hires. In addition, HP ceased pension accruals and eliminated eligibility for the subsidized retiree medical program for current 

117




 

employees
who did not meet defined criteria based on age and years of service (calculated as of December 31, 2005). 

        Additionally,
the HP subsidy for the retiree medical program will be capped upon reaching two times the 2003 subsidy levels. 


        During
fiscal 2006, HP recognized curtailment gains of $24 million for the HP subsidized U.S. retiree medical program. The gains reflected the reduction in the eligible plan
population stemming from the U.S. Enhanced Early Retirement program and the restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2005. HP recorded such gains as reductions of restructuring charges. As subsequent
headcount reductions take place under the restructuring program, HP expects additional curtailment accounting to occur for U.S. pension and post-retirement plans during the first quarter
of fiscal 2007. 

        During
fiscal 2006, HP also recognized settlement gains of $46 million for the U.S. pension plans. During the measurement period between October 1, 2005 and
September 30, 2006, lump-sum benefit payments were made primarily to pension plan participants who left HP under the U.S. Enhanced Early Retirement program and the restructuring
plans. These lump sum benefit payments represent a reduction in the projected benefit obligation. As a result, a portion of the unrecognized gain was recognized in fiscal 2006. The gain was recorded
in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," which requires that a settlement event be
recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. HP recorded the gain as a reduction of restructuring charges in fiscal 2006. 


        Effective
January 1, 2006, HP increased its matching 401(k) contribution to 6% from 4% of eligible salary for those employees who had their pension and retiree medical-program
benefits frozen and for all new employees. 



 Defined Benefit Plans  



        HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. The HP Retirement Plan (the "Retirement
Plan") is a defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees hired on or before December 31, 2002. Benefits under the Retirement Plan generally are based on pay and years of service, except for
eligible pre-acquisition Compaq employees, who do not receive credit for years of service prior to January 1, 2003. Effective December 31, 2005, participants whose
combination of age plus years of service was less than 62 ceased accruing benefits under the Retirement Plan. For U.S employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003, HP sponsors the
Hewlett-Packard Company Cash Account Pension Plan (the "Cash Account Pension Plan"), under which benefits accrue pursuant to a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus
interest. Effective December 31, 2005, the Cash Account Pension Plan was closed to new participants, and participants whose combination of age plus years of service is less than 62 ceased
accruing benefits. 

        Effective
November 30, 2005, HP merged the Cash Account Pension Plan into the Retirement Plan; the merged plan is treated as one plan for certain legal and financial purposes,
including funding requirements. The merger has no impact on the separate benefit structures of the plans. 

        HP
reduces the benefit payable to a U.S. employee under the Retirement Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("the DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan 

118




 


obligations
are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Retirement Plan when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and
projected benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans combined with the DPSP as of the September 30 measurement date is as follows for the following fiscal years ended
October 31:

 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans  



        Through fiscal 2005, substantially all of HP's U.S. employees at December 31, 2002 could become eligible for partially subsidized retiree medical benefits
and retiree life insurance benefits under the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program (the "Pre-2003 Program") and certain other retiree medical programs. Plan participants in the
Pre-2003 Program make contributions based on their choice of medical option and length of service. U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003 may be eligible to
participate in a post-retirement medical plan, the HP Retiree Medical Program but must bear the full cost of their participation. Effective January 1, 2006, employees whose
combination of age and years of service was less than 62 no longer will be eligible for the subsidized Pre-2003 Program, but instead will be eligible for the HP Retiree Medical Program.
Employees no longer eligible for the Pre-2003 Program, as well as employees hired on or after January 1, 2003, are eligible for certain credits under the HP Retirement Medical
Savings Account Plan ("RMSA Plan") upon attaining age 45. Upon retirement, former employees may use credits under the RMSA Plan for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including
premiums required for participation in the HP Retiree Medical Program. 



 Defined Contribution Plans  



        HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was $430 million in fiscal
2006, $422 million in fiscal 2005 and $405 million in fiscal 2004. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan (the "HP 401(k) Plan") when they
meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. On May 3, 2002, HP assumed sponsorship of the Compaq Computer Corporation 401(k) Investment Plan (the "Compaq 401(k) Plan").
Effective January 1, 2004, HP merged the Compaq 401(k) Plan into the HP 401(k) Plan. 


        During
fiscal 2006, HP matched employee contributions to the HP 401(k) Plan with cash contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2006
newly-hired employees, rehired employees and employees who are no longer eligible to participate in defined benefit plans were eligible for a 6% HP matching contribution. 

        Effective

may
receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the HP Stock Fund. HP paid approximately $10 million, $12 million and $13 million in dividends for the HP common
shares held by the HP Stock Fund in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. HP records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. The
HP Stock Fund held approximately 31 million shares of HP common stock at October 31, 2006.

        As
a result of the restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2005, HP re-measured its U.S. defined benefit plan and post-retirement benefit plan obligations
during fiscal 2006.
The 2006 discount rates outlined in the table above are those rates used by HP in conducting each of the respective plan re-measurements and reflect the weighted average rate across all
measurement periods.

 Investment Policy  



        HP's investment strategy for worldwide plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk. The majority of the plans'
investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset
classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment purposes, and HP
occasionally utilizes derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment exposures. 

        The
target asset allocation selected for each plan reflects a risk/return profile HP feels is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP regularly
conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plan assets in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP invests
a portion of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as venture capital funds, private debt and private equity to
provide diversification and higher expected returns. 

124




 


        Outside
the United States, local regulations require different approaches to target asset allocations, resulting in a higher percentage allocation in fixed income securities. For each
country outside the U.S., the local pension board decides on the target allocation after consideration of local regulations and results from periodic asset-liability studies. HP's corporate office
acts in a governance role in periodically reviewing investment strategy and providing a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan. 



 Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets  



        The expected long-term rate of return on assets for each U.S. plan reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests,
the weight of each asset class in the target mix, the correlations among asset classes and their expected volatilities. Expected asset class returns reflect the current yield on U.S. government bonds
and risk premiums for each asset class. In evaluating the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets in the United States, HP considers factors such as historical risk premiums
and current valuations, dividend yields, inflation and expected earnings growth rates. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active
investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the asset class expected returns were adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees. 

        The
approach used to arrive at the expected rate of return on assets for the non-U.S. plans reflects the asset allocation policy of each plan to the expected country real
returns for equity and fixed income investments. On an annual basis, HP gathers empirical data from the local country subsidiaries to determine expected long-term rates of return for
equity and fixed income securities. HP then weights these expected real rates of return based on country specific allocation mixes adjusted for inflation. 



 Future Contributions and Funding Policy  



        In fiscal 2007, HP expects to contribute approximately $120 million to its pension plans and approximately $15 million to cover benefit payments to
U.S. non-qualified plan participants. HP expects to pay approximately $80 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans. HP's funding policy is
to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government and funding and taxing authorities. 


        In
August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Act") was enacted into law. While HP is still evaluating the Act and more IRS guidance is required before HP can fully evaluate
its impact, at this time HP does not expect it to have any significant effect on its current funding strategy for its U.S. pension plans.

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies  

        HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities,
employment, employee benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," HP records a provision
for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and HP can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. HP believes it has adequate provisions for
any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information
and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP's
potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that cash
flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management's
attention and the creation of significant expenses. 

Pending Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations  

        Copyright levies.    As described below, proceedings are ongoing against HP in certain European
Union ("EU") member countries, including litigation in Germany, seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as multifunction devices ("MFDs") and printers) and alleging that these devices enable
producing private copies of copyrighted materials. The total levies due, if imposed, would be based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary.
Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member
countries are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations are opposing the extension of
levies to the digital environment and advocating compensation to rights holders through digital rights management systems. 

        VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP in
June 2001 in Germany before the arbitration board of the Patent and Trademark Office. The proceedings relate to whether and to what extent copyright levies for photocopiers should be imposed in
accordance with copyright laws implemented in Germany on MFDs that allegedly enable the production of copies by private persons. Following unsuccessful arbitration, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against HP
in May 2004 in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on MFDs sold from 1997 to 2001. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments
regarding MFDs sold in Germany and ordered HP to pay VG Wort an amount equal to 5% of the outstanding levies claimed plus interest on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. VG Wort appealed
this decision. On July 6, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals ordered HP to pay VG Wort levies based on the published tariffs for photocopiers in Germany (which range from EUR 38.35 to
EUR 613.56 per unit) plus interest on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. HP has appealed the Stuttgart Court of Appeals' decision to the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal
Supreme Court). On September 26, 2005, VG Wort filed an additional lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on MFDs sold in Germany between 1997 and
2001, as well as for products sold from 2002 onwards. HP filed a response rejecting the claim in January 2006. 

127




 


        In
July 2004, VG Wort filed a separate lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies on printers. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable
for payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable per unit. HP appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Higher Regional Court of
Baden Wuerttemberg. On May 11, 2005, the Higher Regional Court issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On June 6, 2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Supreme Court in
Karlsruhe. 

        In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in Munich State Court seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry test case in Germany, and
HP has undertaken to be bound by a final decision. On December 23, 2004, the Munich State Court held that PCs are subject to a levy and that FSC must pay 12 euros plus compound interest for
each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. FSC appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Higher Regional Court of Bavaria. On December 15, 2005, the Higher Regional Court
affirmed the Munich State Court decision. FSC filed a notice of appeal with the German Supreme Court in February 2006. 

        On
December 29, 2005, ZPU, a joint association of various German collection societies, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP before the arbitration
board of the Patent and Trademark Office demanding reporting of every PC sold by HP in Germany from January 2002 through December 2005 and seeking a levy of 18.42 euros plus tax for each
PC sold during that period. HP filed a notice of defense in connection with these proceedings in February 2006 and the grounds for its defense in May 2006. 

        Based
on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the units impacted and levies, HP
has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters, including the number of units impacted, the amount of
levies imposed and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

SIZE=2>Alvis v. HP is a defective product consumer class action filed in the District Court of Jefferson
County, Texas in April 2001. In February 2000, a similar suit captioned LaPray v. Compaq was filed in
the District Court of Jefferson County, Texas. The basic allegation is that HP and Compaq sold computers containing floppy disk controllers that fail to alert the user to certain floppy disk
controller errors. That failure is alleged to result in data loss or data corruption. The complaints in Alvis and  LaPray seek injunctive
relief, declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. In July 2001, a
nationwide class was certified in the LaPray case, which the Beaumont Court of Appeals affirmed in June 2002. The
Texas Supreme Court reversed the certification and remanded to the trial court in May 2004. On March 29, 2005, the  Alvis trial court certified a Texas-wide class action for injunctive
relief only, which HP appealed on
April 15, 2005. HP's appeal in the Alvis case is still pending. On June 4, 2003, each of  Barrett v. HP and <FONT
SIZE=2>Grider v.
Compaq was filed in the District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma, with factual allegations similar to those in  Alvis and <FONT
SIZE=2>LaPray. The complaints in  Barrett and Grider seek, among other things,
specific performance, declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. On December 22, 2003, the District Court entered an order staying the  Barrett case until the conclusion of
Alvis. On
September 23, 2005, the District Court granted the Grider plaintiffs' motion to certify a nationwide class action
which the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed on October 13, 2006. On November 5, 2006, HP filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Oklahoma Supreme Court seeking reversal
of the lower courts' decisions. On November 5, 2004, Batiste v. HP (formerly  Scott v. HP), and on January 27, 2005,
Schultz v.
HP (formerly Jurado v. HP), 

128




 


were
filed in state court in San Joaquin County, California, with factual allegations similar to those in LaPray and  Alvis, seeking certification
of a California-only class, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (including
punitive damages), restitution, costs, and attorneys' fees. On November 27, 2006, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification and certified the  Schultz case as a
California-only class. HP intends to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate with the California Court of
Appeal seeking reversal of the trial court's class certification decision. In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General
and other Federal agencies are conducting an investigation of allegations that HP and Compaq made, or caused to be made, false claims for payment to the United States for computers known by HP and
Compaq to contain defective parts or otherwise to perform in a defective manner relating to the same alleged floppy disk controller errors. HP agreed with the Department of Justice to extend the
statute of limitations on its investigation until December 6, 2006. HP is cooperating fully with this investigation.

SIZE=2>Barbara's Sales, et al. v. Intel Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, et al. and  Neubauer, et al. v. Compaq Computer Corporation are separate
lawsuits filed on June 3, 2002 in the Circuit
Court, Third Judicial District, Madison County, Illinois, alleging that HP and Compaq (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged material fact that systems that use
the Intel Pentium 4 processor are less powerful and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and
certification of a nationwide class. The trial court in the HP action certified an Illinois class as to Intel but denied a nationwide class. Both parties appealed the trial court's decision. On
July 25, 2006, the Fifth District Appellate Court ruled that the trial court erred in applying Illinois law in deciding to certify the Illinois class and to deny certification of the nationwide
class and directed the trial court to reconsider those decisions applying California law instead. On August 28, 2006, Intel appealed the Fifth District's decision to the Illinois Supreme Court,
and the Illinois Supreme Court granted Intel's petition for appeal on November 29, 2006. Proceedings against HP have been stayed pending resolution of the parties' appeal of this decision. The
class action certification against Compaq has been stayed pending resolution of the parties' appeal in the HP action. Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation
and Hewlett-Packard Company is a lawsuit to which HP was joined on June 14, 2004 that was initially filed in state court in Alameda County, California,
based upon factual allegations similar to those in the Illinois cases. The plaintiffs in the Skold matter also seek
unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and certification of a nationwide class. The Skold case has
since been transferred to state court in Santa Clara County, California. 

        <FONT
SIZE=2>Feder v. HP (formerly Tyler v. HP) is a lawsuit filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California on June 16, 2005 asserting breach of express and implied warranty, unjust enrichment, violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and
deceptive advertising and unfair business practices in violation of California's Unfair Competition Law. Among other things, plaintiffs alleged that HP employed a "smart chip" in certain inkjet
printing products in order to register ink depletion prematurely and to render the cartridge unusable through a built-in expiration date that is hidden, not documented in marketing
materials to consumers, or both. Plaintiffs also contend that consumers received false ink depletion warnings and that the smart chip limits the ability of consumers to use the cartridge to its full
capacity or to choose competitive products. On September 6, 2005, a lawsuit captioned Ciolino v. HP was filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The allegations in the Ciolino case are substantively
identical to those in Feder, and the two cases have been formally consolidated in a single proceeding in the District 

129




 


Court
for the Northern District of California under the caption In Re: HP Inkjet Printer Litigation. The plaintiffs seek
class certification, restitution, damages (including enhanced damages), injunctive relief, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. Three related lawsuits filed in California state court,  Tyler v. HP<FONT
SIZE=2> (filed in Santa Clara County on February 17, 2005), Obi v.
HP (filed in Los Angeles County on February 17, 2005), and Weingart v. HP
(filed in Los Angeles County on March 18, 2005), have been dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs. In addition, two related lawsuits filed in federal court, namely  Grabell v. HP
(filed in the District of New Jersey on March 18, 2005) and Just
v. HP (filed in the Eastern District of New York on April 20, 2005), have been dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs. Substantially similar
allegations have been made against HP and its subsidiary, Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Co., in four Canadian class actions, one commenced in British Columbia in February 2006, two commenced in
Quebec in April 2006 and May 2006, respectively, and one commenced in Ontario in June 2006, all seeking class certification, restitution, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and
unspecified statutory, compensatory and punitive damages. 

        On
December 27, 2001, Cornell University and the Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. filed a
complaint, amended on September 6, 2002, against HP in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that HP's PA-RISC 8000 family of microprocessors,
and servers and
workstations incorporating those processors, infringe a patent assigned to Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. that describes a way of executing microprocessor instructions. The complaint seeks
declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On March 26, 2004, the court issued a ruling interpreting the disputed claim terms in the patent at issue. Trial is expected to
commence in mid- to late 2007. The patent at issue in this litigation, United States Patent No. 4,807,115, expired on February 21, 2006. Therefore, the plaintiffs are no
longer entitled to seek injunctive relief against HP. 

        <FONT
SIZE=2>Miller, et al. v. Hewlett-Packard Company is a lawsuit filed on March 21, 2005 in the United States
District Court for the District of Idaho on behalf of a putative class of persons who were employed by third-party temporary service agencies and who performed work at HP facilities in the United
States. Plaintiffs claim that they were incorrectly classified as contractors or contingent workers and, as a result, were wrongfully denied employee benefits covered by the Employment Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and benefits not covered by ERISA. Plaintiffs claim they were denied participation in HP's Share Ownership Plan, service award program, adoption assistance
program, credit union, dependent care reimbursement program, educational assistance program, time off programs, flexible work arrangements, and the 401(k) plan. On May 22, 2005, plaintiffs
filed their first amended complaint, which added a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") claim and defined the class to include those persons who have been, or now are, hired by
HP through agencies to work at HP facilities in the United States from March 21, 2000 through the present who have been deprived of the full benefit of employee status by being misclassified as
contractors, contingent workers or temporary workers or were otherwise misclassed. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, an injunction, retroactive and prospective benefits and compensation, unspecified
damages and enhanced damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. HP successfully moved to dismiss the ERISA and WARN claims. The sole remaining claim being advanced by the remaining plaintiffs in
this case is a breach of contract claim. 

        <FONT
SIZE=2>Digwamaje et al. v. Bank of America et al. is a purported class action lawsuit that names HP and numerous
other multinational corporations as defendants. It was filed on September 27, 2002 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of current and former South
African citizens and their survivors who suffered violence and oppression under the apartheid regime. 

130




 


The
lawsuit alleges that HP and other companies helped perpetuate, profited from, and otherwise aided and abetted the apartheid regime during the period from 1948-1994 by selling products
and services to agencies of the South African government. Claims are based on the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture Victims Protection Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and
state law. The complaint seeks, among other things, an accounting, the creation of a historic commission, compensatory damages in excess of $200 billion, punitive damages in excess of
$200 billion, costs and attorneys' fees. On November 29, 2004, the court dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs' complaint. In May 2005, the plaintiffs filed an amended notice of
appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On January 24, 2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral argument on the plaintiffs' appeal but has not yet
issued a decision. 

        CSIRO Patent Litigation.    Microsoft Corporation,
Hewlett-Packard Company, et al. v. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Australia is an action filed by HP and two other
plaintiffs on May 9, 2005 in the District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a declaratory judgment against Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of
Australia ("CSIRO") that HP's products employing the IEEE 802.11a and 8.02.11g wireless protocol standards do not infringe CSIRO's US patent no. 5,487,069 relating to wireless
transmission of data at frequencies in excess of 10GHz. On September 22, 2005, CSIRO filed an answer and counterclaims alleging that all HP products which employ those wireless protocol
standards infringe the CSIRO patent and seeking damages, including enhanced damages and attorneys fees and costs, and an injunction against sales of infringing products. On December 12, 2006,
CSIRO successfully moved to have the case transferred to the District Court of the Eastern District of Texas, a court that has granted CSIRO's motions for summary judgment on the issues of validity
and patent infringement in a patent infringement action brought by CSIRO against a third party vendor of wireless networking products based on the same patent. 

        Leak Investigation Proceedings.    As described below, HP is the subject of various governmental
inquiries concerning the processes employed in an investigation into leaks of HP confidential information to members of the media: 



•In
August 2006, HP was informally contacted by the Attorney General of the State of California requesting information concerning the processes employed in the leak
investigation.
•Beginning
in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives (the "Committee") for records and
information concerning the leak investigation, securities transactions by HP officers and directors, including an August 25, 2006 securities transaction by Mark Hurd, HP's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and related matters. HP has responded and is continuing to respond to those requests. In addition, Mr. Hurd voluntarily gave testimony before the Committee regarding the leak
investigation on September 28, 2006.
•In
September 2006, HP was informally contacted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California requesting similar information concerning the
processes employed in the leak investigation. HP is responding to that request.
•Beginning
in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission for records and information and interviews
with current and former HP directors and officers relating to the leak investigation, the resignation of 

131




 



Thomas J.
Perkins from HP's Board of Directors, HP's May 22, 2006 and September 6, 2006 filings with the Commission on Form 8-K, stock repurchases by HP and securities
transactions by its officers and directors that occurred between May 1 and October 1, 2006, and HP's policies, practices and approval of securities transactions. The Commission has
issued a formal order of investigation in connection with its inquiry. HP has responded and is continuing to respond to those requests. 



•In
September 2006, HP received a request from the Federal Communications Commission for records and information relating to the processes employed in the leak investigation.
HP is responding to that request. 


HP
is continuing to cooperate fully with all ongoing inquiries and investigations. 

        On
December 7, 2006, HP announced that it has entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve civil claims arising from the leak investigation, including
a claim made by the California Attorney General in a Santa Clara County Superior Court action filed on December 7, 2006 that HP committed unfair business practices under California law in
connection with the leak investigation. As a result of this agreement, which includes an injunction, the California Attorney General will not pursue civil claims against HP or its current and former
directors, officers and employees. Under the terms of the agreement, HP will pay a total of $14.5 million and implement and maintain for five years a series of measures designed to ensure that
HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards. Of the $14.5 million, $13.5 million will be used to create a
Privacy and Piracy Fund to assist California prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting consumer privacy and information piracy violations, $650,000 will be used to pay statutory damages and
$350,000 will reimburse the California Attorney General's office for its investigation costs. There was no finding of liability against HP as part of the settlement. 


        In
addition, four stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in California purportedly on behalf of HP stockholders seeking to recover damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty
and to require HP to improve its corporate governance and internal control procedures as a result of the activities of the leak investigation: Staehr v.
Dunn, et al. was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 18, 2006; Worsham v. Dunn, et
al. was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 14, 2006; Tansey v. Dunn, et
al. was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 20, 2006; and Hall v. Dunn, et
al. was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 25, 2006. On October 19, 2006, the Santa Clara County Superior Court consolidated
the four California cases under the caption In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation. The consolidated complaint
filed on November 19, 2006 also seeks to recover damages in connection with sales of HP stock alleged to have been made by certain current and former HP officers and directors while in
possession of material non-public information. An additional stockholder derivative lawsuit, Pifko v. Babbio, et
al., was filed in Chancery Court, County of New Castle, Delaware, on September 19, 2006 seeking to recover damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty
and to obtain an order instructing the defendants to refrain from further breaches of fiduciary duty and to implement corrective measures that will prevent future occurrences of the alleged breaches
of fiduciary duty. The HP Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee consisting of independent Board members authorized to investigate, review, and evaluate the facts and
circumstances asserted in these derivative matters and to determine how HP should proceed in these matters. 

132




 


        European Commission OEM Investigation.    In May 2002, the European Commission of the EU publicly stated that it was
considering conducting an investigation into original equipment manufacturer activities concerning the sales of printers and supplies to consumers within the EU. The European Commission contacted HP
requesting information on the printing systems businesses. HP has cooperated fully with this inquiry. 


Settled and Concluded Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations  

        Compression Labs Patent Litigation.    On October 25, 2006, HP and 22 other companies
entered into a Patent License and Settlement Agreement with Compression Labs, Inc., a subsidiary of Forgent Networks ("CLI"), to resolve all outstanding patent infringement litigation with CLI
related to U.S. Patent No. 4,698,672 (the "'672 Patent"). The settlement agreement results in the dismissal with prejudice of Compression
Labs, Inc. v. HP et al., a lawsuit filed by CLI on April 22, 2004 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and
subsequently consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Northern District of California with nine other similar lawsuits between CLI and one or more of the defendants. CLI sought
unspecified damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees for alleged infringement of the '672 Patent, which CLI asserted was infringed by the JPEG still-image compression standard. Under the
terms of the settlement agreement, the defendants agreed to pay CLI an aggregate of $8 million (a portion of which was paid by HP), and CLI
granted HP and the other defendants a worldwide, nonexclusive, fully paid-up and irrevocable license in exchange. 

Environmental  

        HP is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by United States or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former
operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and
outside the United States, even if not subject to regulations imposed by local governments. 

        The
European Union ("EU") has enacted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially
responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. The deadline for the individual member states of the EU to enact the directive in their
respective countries was August 13, 2004 (such legislation, together with the directive, the "WEEE Legislation"). Producers participating in the market were financially responsible for
implementing these responsibilities under the WEEE Legislation beginning in August 2005. Implementation in certain of the member states has been delayed into 2006 and 2007. Similar legislation
has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. HP is continuing to evaluate the impact of the WEEE Legislation and similar
legislation in other jurisdictions as individual countries issue their implementation guidance. 

        The
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued amounts in
conjunction with the foregoing environmental issues that we believe was adequate as of October 31, 2006. These accruals were not material to our operations or financial position, and we do not
currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

 Segment Data  



        HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies HP uses to derive business segment
results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations.
Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. HP does not allocate to its business segments certain operating
expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense related to
HP-granted employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, certain acquisition-related charges and charges for purchased IPR&D, as well as certain corporate governance costs. 

        HP
does not allocate to its business segments restructuring charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions. Workforce rebalancing charges, which include
involuntary workforce 

136




 


reductions
and voluntary severance incentives, recorded in the six months ended April 30, 2005 have been included in business segment results.

of products, cost of services and financing interest.
(2)EPS
for each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter, while EPS for the fiscal year is computed using the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the EPS for each of the four quarters may not equal the EPS for the fiscal year.

Controls and Procedures  

        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to HP, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and
(ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
