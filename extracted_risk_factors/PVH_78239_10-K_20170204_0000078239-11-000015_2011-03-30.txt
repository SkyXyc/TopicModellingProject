Item 1A. Risk Factors




Recent and future economic conditions, including turmoil in the financial and credit markets, may adversely affect our business.

 

Economic conditions may adversely affect our business, our customers and our financing and other contractual arrangements. Recent and future economic developments may lead to a reduction in consumer spending overall, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Such events could also adversely affect the businesses of our wholesale and retail customers, which may, among other things, result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, and may cause such customers to reduce or discontinue orders of our products. Financial difficulties of customers may also affect the ability of our customers to access credit markets or lead to higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers.




Recent or future turmoil in the financial and credit markets could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises or on terms that would be acceptable to us.




A substantial portion of our revenue and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue.

 

A few of our customers, including Macy’s, J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 22.6% of our revenue in 2010, 31.0% of our revenue in 2009 and 31.7% of our revenue in 2008. Macy’s, our largest customer, accounted for 10.1% of our revenue in 2010, 11.9% of our revenue in 2009 and 11.5% of our revenue in 2008.




Tommy Hilfiger is party to a strategic alliance with Macy’s providing for the exclusive wholesale distribution in the United States of most men’s, women’s and children’s sportswear under the Tommy Hilfiger brand. The current term of the agreement with Macy’s ends on January 31, 2014 and is renewable at the option of Macy’s for up to two additional renewal terms of three years each. Prior to our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, Macy’s represented approximately 14% of Tommy Hilfiger’s North America revenue and 6% of its total revenue. As a result of this strategic alliance, the success of Tommy Hilfiger’s North American wholesale business is substantially dependent on this relationship and on Macy’s ability to maintain and increase sales of Tommy Hilfiger products. Upon the expiration of the current term of the Macy’s agreement and each subsequent three-year term, Macy’s may be unwilling to renew the Macy’s agreement on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, our and Tommy Hilfiger’s United States wholesale businesses may be affected by any operational or financial difficulties that Macy’s experiences, including any deterioration in Macy’s overall ability to attract customer traffic or in its overall liquidity position.




Other than Tommy Hilfiger’s strategic alliance with Macy’s, we do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability. During the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes to be ongoing. In addition, store closings by our customers decrease the number of stores carrying our apparel products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.





We may not be able to continue to develop and grow our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses in terms of revenue and profitability.





A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. Our realization of revenue and profitability growth from Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger will depend largely upon our ability to:









·  


continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identity of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands;








  



18







  









  

 







·  


retain key employees at our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses;















·  


continue to maintain good working relationships with Calvin Klein’s and Tommy Hilfiger’s licensees;















·  


continue to enter into new (or renew or extend existing) licensing agreements for the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, both domestically and internationally; and















·  


continue to strengthen and expand the Tommy Hilfiger business.








We cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for these brands, nor can we assure you that the launch of any additional product lines or businesses by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space and/or add additional product lines, our ability to develop new relationships with retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to continue to develop and grow either the Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger business in terms of revenue and profitability, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.





The success of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger depends on the value of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, and if the value of either of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely affected.


 

Our success depends on our brands and their value. The Calvin Klein name is integral to the existing Calvin Klein business, as well as to our strategies for continuing to grow and expand Calvin Klein. The Calvin Klein brands could be adversely affected if Mr. Klein’s public image or reputation were to be tarnished. We have similar exposure with respect to the Tommy Hilfiger brands. Mr. Hilfiger is closely identified with the Tommy Hilfiger brand and any negative perception with respect to Mr. Hilfiger could adversely affect the Tommy Hilfiger brand. In addition, under Mr. Hilfiger’s employment agreement, if his employment is terminated for any reason, his agreement not to compete with Tommy Hilfiger will expire two years after such termination. Although Mr. Hilfiger could not use any Tommy Hilfiger trademark in connection with a competitive business, his association with a competitive business could adversely affect Tommy Hilfiger.





Our level of debt could impair our financial condition.





In connection with the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, we borrowed term loans (of which $1.7 billion in principal amount was outstanding as of January 30, 2011) under our senior secured credit facility and issued $600 million in high-yield notes. We also have $100 million of secured debentures outstanding. Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:








·  


requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;











·  


limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;











·  


increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;











·  


limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans and general corporate requirements;











·  


placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, contributions to pension plans and general corporate requirements; and







  



19







  





·  with respect to any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including under our revolving credit facility, leaving us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.






Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.





Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increased significantly as a result of the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, as the Tommy Hilfiger business has a substantial international component. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Canadian dollar, will have a significantly larger negative impact on our results of operations than prior to the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Our Tommy Hilfiger business purchases the majority of the products that it sells in United States dollars, which exposes the international Tommy Hilfiger business to foreign exchange risk as the United States dollar fluctuates. As such, we currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with United States dollar denominated purchases by the Tommy Hilfiger international business.




We are also exposed to market risk for changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar in connection with our licensing businesses, particularly our Calvin Klein business. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee’s local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to exchange rate changes during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign license agreements expose us to exchange rate changes up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be adversely impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted.




We have licensed businesses in countries that are or have been subject to exchange rate control regulations and have, as a result, experienced difficulties in receiving payments owed to us when due, with amounts left unpaid for extended periods of time. Although the amounts to date have been immaterial to us, as our international businesses grow and if controls are enacted or enforced in additional countries, there can be no assurance that such controls would not have a material and adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.





We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.





All of our apparel and footwear products, excluding handmade and handfinished neckwear, are produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in Europe, the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, South America, the Caribbean and Central America. We believe that we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. Although no single supplier or country is expected to be critical to our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:








·  


political or labor instability in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;











·  


political or military conflict involving the United States, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;











·  


heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;











·  


a significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials or the inability to use raw materials produced in a country that is a major provider due to political, human rights, labor, environmental, animal cruelty or other concerns;











·  


a significant decrease in factory and shipping capacity;











·  


a significant increase in wage and shipping costs;







  



20







  








  

 







·  


disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;











·  


the migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;











·  


imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;











·  


imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;











·  


significant fluctuation of the value of the United States dollar against foreign currencies; and











·  


restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located.








If our manufacturers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, our business could suffer.





We require our manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers to determine compliance. However, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices. If one of our manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.




We are dependent on third parties to source and/or manufacture our products and any disruption in the relationship with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our businesses.






We rely upon independent third parties for the vast majority of our apparel and footwear products. A manufacturer’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.




In addition, we are a party to a non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung to carry out most of our sourcing for Tommy Hilfiger products. Li & Fung is one of the world’s largest buying agencies for apparel and related goods and is our largest buying office for Tommy Hilfiger products. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of our global sourcing needs for Tommy Hilfiger products. The buying agency agreement with Li & Fung is terminable by us upon 12 months’ prior notice for any reason, and is terminable by either party (i) upon six months’ prior notice in the event of a material breach by the other party and (ii) immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to the other party. We also use other third-party buying offices for a portion of our sourcing for Tommy Hilfiger products and have retained a small in-house sourcing team. Any interruption in the operations of Li & Fung or other buying offices, or the failure of Li & Fung or other buying offices to perform effectively their services for us, could result in material delays, reductions of shipments and increased costs. Furthermore, such events could harm our wholesale and retail relationships. Although alternative sourcing companies exist, we may be unable to source Tommy Hilfiger products through other third parties, if at all, on terms commercially acceptable to us and on a timely basis. Any disruption in our relationship with our buying offices or businesses, particularly Li & Fung, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations.





We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.





We operate a limited number of distribution facilities. Our ability to meet the needs of our retail customers and of our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of our primary facilities. If any of our primary facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could have a substantial loss of inventory and/or




  



21







  




disruptions of deliveries to our customers and our stores, and/or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.





A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on royalties and licensing.





Royalty, advertising and other revenue from Calvin Klein’s three largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 69% of its royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2010. From the date of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger through January 30, 2011, royalty, advertising and other revenue from Tommy Hilfiger’s three largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 36% of its royalty, advertising and other revenue. We also derive licensing revenue from our Van Heusen, IZOD, Bass, G.H. Bass & Co. and ARROW brand names, as well as from the sublicensing of Geoffrey Beene. The operating profit associated with our royalty, advertising and other revenue is significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss of a significant licensing partner, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the licensing partner’s operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the partner), without an equivalent replacement, could materially affect our profitability.

 

While we generally have significant control over our licensing partners’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Our licensing partners’ failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing licensing partners could materially and adversely affect our revenue both directly from reduced royalty and advertising and other revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with our licensing partners’ ability to obtain capital; execute their business plans, including timely delivery of quality products; manage their labor relations; maintain relationships with their suppliers; manage their credit risk effectively; and maintain relationships with their customers.





Our licensing business makes us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.





We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we make every attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. The misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Calvin Klein in the past has been involved in legal proceedings with Warnaco with respect to certain quality and distribution issues. Warnaco is entitled to control design and advertising related to the sale of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing the Calvin Klein marks, although to date, it continues to work with Calvin Klein’s in-house advertising agency while exercising its rights with respect to design. We cannot assure you that Warnaco will continue to maintain the same standards of design and, if it assumes control, advertising that has been maintained by Calvin Klein, although we believe they are generally obligated to do so.





Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.





Our North American retail stores are located principally in outlet malls, which are typically located in or near vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. As a result, reduced travel resulting from economic conditions, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including adverse weather conditions, disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse affect on us. In 2008 and 2009, certain of our and Tommy Hilfiger’s businesses and those of certain of our and Tommy Hilfiger’s licensees were adversely affected by the curtailment of travel that accompanied the global economic slowdown. Other factors which could affect the success of our stores include:








·  


the location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;











·  


the other tenants occupying space at the mall;











·  


increased competition in areas where the outlet malls are located; and











·  


the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls.










  



22







  





           We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.





Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. Since our acquisitions of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, we are more susceptible to infringement of our intellectual property rights, as the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the generally higher pricing of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger branded products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenue. We cannot assure you that the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license and/or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar marks. For example, in the past we were involved in proceedings relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to the IZOD mark in Mexico and to another company’s claim of prior rights to the Calvin Klein mark in Chile. We are currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to marks similar to some of our brands, both domestically and internationally.





Our success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.





Our business strategy is to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. This strategy is designed to provide stability should market trends shift. As part of this strategy we license the names and brands of recognized designers and celebrities, including Kenneth Cole, Sean “Diddy” Combs (Sean John), Donald J. Trump, Michael Kors, Joseph Abboud, Donna Karan (DKNY), Ike Behar, Elie Tahari and Robert Graham. In entering into these license agreements, we target our products towards certain market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution in order to minimize competition between our own products and maximize profitability. If any of our licensors determines to “reposition” a brand we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as products may be personally associated with these designers and celebrities, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individual’s images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.





We face intense competition in the apparel industry.





Competition is intense in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, some of which are significantly larger or more diversified or have greater resources than we do. In addition, through their use of private label programs, we compete directly with our wholesale customers. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:








·  


anticipating and responding to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;











·  


maintaining favorable brand recognition;











·  


appropriately pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;











·  


providing strong and effective marketing support;











·  


ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and











·  


obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.







The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we misjudge the market for our products, we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others.




  



23







  




           The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.




We depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.





Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies.





One component of our growth strategy contemplates our making select acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. However, these benefits may not be realized due to, among other things:








·  


delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;











·  


higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;











·  


diversion of the attention and resources of management;











·  


consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;











·  


inability to retain key employees in acquired companies; and











·  


assumption of liabilities unrecognized in due diligence.







We cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.





A significant shift in the relative sources of our earnings, adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.


 

We have direct operations in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong and China, and the applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction. As a result, our overall effective tax rate could be materially affected by the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which our earnings are subject. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the various countries in which we operate may be subject to change and there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws, regulations or treaties in the jurisdictions in which we operate are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner.

 

In addition, various national and local taxing authorities periodically examine us and our subsidiaries. The resolution of an examination or audit may result in us making a payment in an amount that differs from the amount for which we may have reserved with respect to any particular tax matter, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.






We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place which should be respected for tax purposes, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional tax becoming due.

 


If we are unable to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, our profitability could be reduced.





Our deferred income tax assets are valuable to us. These assets include tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on a number of factors, including whether there will be adequate levels of taxable income in future periods to offset the tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen. Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. In assessing the adequacy of our valuation allowances, we consider various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, forecasted future taxable income, and potential tax planning strategies. In




  



24







  




addition, the United States tax rules impose an annual limit on the amount of certain loss carryovers of Tommy Hilfiger that we can use following the acquisition, and, depending on our taxable income in tax years following the acquisition, such limit may be material. These factors could reduce the value of the deferred tax assets, which could have a material effect on our profitability.




Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.




Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain provisions, including provisions requiring supermajority voting (80% of the outstanding voting power) to approve certain business combinations with beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding stock entitled to vote for election of directors, permitting the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board and authorizing the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of deterring changes of control.




In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors.




Item 1B
