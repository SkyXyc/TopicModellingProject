. Risk Factors.We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.2Table of ContentsPART IItem 1. BusinessOverviewMarathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009. We have 127 years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the Ohio Oil Company in 1887. We are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the United States and the largest east of the Mississippi. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.•Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway® business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast.•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX LP.See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 for operating segment and geographic financial information, which is incorporated herein by reference.Corporate History and StructureMPC was incorporated in 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”). On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing & Transportation Business (“RM&T Business”) into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock on June 30, 2011 (the “Spinoff”). Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. All subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by Marathon Oil to MPC remained with Marathon Oil and, together with Marathon Oil, are referred to as the “Marathon Oil Companies.” On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “MPC.” Recent DevelopmentsOn September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess Corporation (“Hess”) all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) on Colonial Pipeline, for $2.82 billion. We refer to these assets as “Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 mbpd of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets. In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.’s Southern Access Extension (“SAX”) pipeline, which will run from Flanagan, Ill. to Patoka, Ill. and is expected to be operational in late 2015. This option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the SAX pipeline and our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project as discussed below. During 2014, we made contributions of $120 million to Illinois Extension Pipeline Company, LLC (“Illinois Extension Pipeline”) to fund our portion of the construction costs incurred-to-date on the SAX pipeline project.On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio from Felda Iffco Sdn Bhd, Malaysia for $40 million. The plant currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million gallons per year. 3Table of ContentsIn March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (“Explorer”) for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.In November 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”) to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $192 million during 2014 and have contributed $216 million since project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service, which is expected to be in 2017. Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. On August 1, 2013, we acquired from Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests in three ethanol companies for $75 million. Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional 24 percent interest in The Andersons Clymers Ethanol LLC (“TACE”), bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent; a 34 percent interest in The Andersons Ethanol Investment LLC (“TAEI”), which holds a 50 percent ownership in The Andersons Marathon Ethanol LLC (“TAME”), bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to 67 percent; and a 40 percent interest in The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC (“TAAE”), which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. On October 1, 2013, our ownership interest in TAAE increased to 43 percent as a result of TAAE acquiring one of the owner’s interest. On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP Products North America Inc. and BP Pipelines (North America) Inc. (collectively, “BP”) the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.” We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP $180 million for the first period’s contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 26 for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project and the Sandpiper pipeline project. MPLX LPIn 2012, we formed MPLX LP (“MPLX”), a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19.9 million common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. As of December 31, 2014, we owned a 71.5 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest. MPLX’s initial assets consisted of a 51 percent general partner interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LP (“Pipe Line Holdings”), which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings.On May 1, 2013, we sold a five percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for $100 million, which was financed by MPLX with cash on hand.On March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. 4Table of ContentsOn October 30, 2014, we announced plans to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX, which is expected to provide unitholders an average annual distribution growth rate percentage in the mid-20s over the next five years as we build meaningful scale more quickly. We believe this increased scale provides MPLX greater flexibility to fund organic projects and to pursue acquisition opportunities. On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling 30.5 percent to MPLX for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million MPLX common units valued at $200 million. MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.On December 8, 2014, MPLX completed a public offering of 3.5 million common units at a price to the public of $66.68 per common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million. MPLX used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. On December 10, 2014, we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in MPLX by purchasing 130 thousand general partner units for $9 million.On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed its initial underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information on MPLX.Our Competitive StrengthsHigh Quality Refining AssetsWe believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the fourth largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. We own a seven-plant refinery network, with approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day (“mmbpcd”) of crude oil throughput capacity. Our refineries process a wide range of crude oils, including heavy and sour crude oils, which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil, and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates, specialty chemicals and other refined products. While we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils, our refineries have the ability to process up to 68 percent light sweet crude oils.Strategic LocationThe geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages. Located in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) II and PADD III, which consist of states in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources, including domestic, Canadian and other foreign sources, which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs. For example, geographic proximity to various United States shale oil regions and Canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to price-advantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors. Our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key end-user markets across the United States quickly and cost-effectively. 5Table of Contents  *As of December 31, 2014Extensive Midstream Distribution NetworksOur assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions, including weather-related and marketplace disruptions. We believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and products pipelines. Through our ownership interests in MPLX, we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volume delivered. We also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, as well as trucking and rail assets. We operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network, which enables us to optimize feedstock and other raw material supplies and refined product distribution, and further allows for important economies of scale across our system.6Table of ContentsGeneral Partner and Sponsor of MPLXOur investment in MPLX should allow us to enhance our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests which tend to receive higher market multiples. MPLX also provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets. MPLX’s significant liquidity and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business. Our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks. We have an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX, providing MPLX with a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2014, these assets included:•approximately 5,400 miles of crude oil and products pipelines that MPC owns, leases or has an ownership interest;•19 owned or leased inland towboats and 211 owned or leased inland barges;•63 owned and operated light product terminals with approximately 20 million barrels of storage capacity and 192 loading lanes;•18 owned and operated asphalt terminals with approximately 5 million barrels of storage capacity and 65 loading lanes;•one leased and two non-operated, partially-owned light product terminals;•2,210 owned or leased railcars;•59 million barrels of tank and cavern storage capacity at our refineries;•25 rail and 24 truck loading racks at our refineries;•seven owned and 11 non-owned docks at our refineries;•a condensate splitter at our Canton refinery; and•approximately 20 billion gallons of fuels distribution.We continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of midstream assets, including investments in the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects and a condensate splitter project at our Catlettsburg refinery. We broadly estimate these assets and growth projects can generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $1.6 billion. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on these pipeline investments.Competitively Positioned Marketing OperationsWe are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area. We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,750 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, comprised of approximately 5,460 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states as of December 31, 2014. In addition, as part of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in 2013 and Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets in 2014, we obtained retail marketing contracts that provide us with the opportunity to convert the associated retail outlets to the Marathon brand. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding retail marketing contract assignments for approximately 590 retail outlets. We believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost.Attractive Growth OpportunitiesWe believe we have attractive growth opportunities. Our capital and investment budget for 2015 of $2.53 billion includes $1.28 billion for the Refining & Marketing segment (which includes $234 million for midstream investments), $452 million for the Speedway segment and $659 million for the Pipeline Transportation segment. Our Refining & Marketing segment’s midstream investments include building condensate splitters at our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries to increase our capacity to process condensate from the Utica Shale region. The condensate splitter at our Canton refinery began operation at the end of 2014 and we expect to complete the condensate splitter at our Catlettsburg refinery in 2015. Our Refining & Marketing segment’s investments also include refining margin enhancement projects, including projects to further capture synergies at our Galveston Bay refinery, increase our distillate production, expand our export capacity and increase our capacity to process condensates and light crude oils.Our Speedway segment investments include converting and integrating Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets, constructing new convenience stores and rebuilding existing locations. We also anticipate acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions. 7Table of ContentsOur Pipeline Transportation segment’s midstream investments include investments in equity interests in the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects that will transport crude oil from growing North American hydrocarbon production regions to our refineries. MPLX is also pursuing the Cornerstone pipeline project, which will connect the Utica Shale production to our Canton, Ohio refinery. There are also potential opportunities for additional build-out projects to provide transportation solutions from the Utica Shale region to a wide range of markets. Established Track Record of Profitability and Diversified Income StreamWe have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle. We believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results. Income generated by our Speedway segment, which was significantly expanded with the acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets, and our Pipeline Transportation segment is less sensitive to business cycles while our Refining & Marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable. Strong Financial PositionAs of December 31, 2014, we had $1.49 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.80 billion in unused committed borrowing facilities, excluding MPLX’s credit facility. We had $6.64 billion of debt at year-end, which represented 37 percent of our total capitalization. This combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies.Our Business StrategiesAchieve and Maintain Top-Tier Safety and Environmental PerformanceWe remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. We have a history of safe and reliable operations, which was demonstrated again in 2014 with a solid performance compared to the industry average. Four of our refineries have earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”) Star site. In addition, we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations. We proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance, with our 2014 designated environmental incidents showing an additional 15 percent reduction over 2013 results. Our Robinson, Illinois refinery had no significant designated environmental incidents in 2014, and our Galveston Bay refinery achieved further reduction of approximately 87 percent in designated environmental incidents since we acquired it on February 1, 2013. Grow Higher-Valued, Stable Cash Flow BusinessesWe intend to allocate significantly more capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses. These businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows. Our capital and investment budget for 2015 includes investments in both our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments related to midstream assets. We have budgeted $234 million for midstream assets that are part of the Refining & Marketing segment, $659 million for the Pipeline Transportation segment and $452 million for the Speedway segment. We plan to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX and intend to evolve it into a large cap, diversified MLP. We intend to increase revenue on the MPLX network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets, by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of MPC’s operations and from increased third-party activity in MPLX’s areas of operations. We also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets through MPLX, both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas. We expect there will continue to be significant investments in infrastructure to connect growing North American crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers. We intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure build-out and grow our midstream business primarily through MPLX. We significantly expanded Speedway’s presence along the East Coast and Southeast through our acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets. We intend to continue growing Speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of these locations, from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies. We also remain focused on organic growth through constructing new stores, rebuilding old stores, acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations. We have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, western Pennsylvania and Tennessee. In addition, our highly successful Speedy Rewards® customer loyalty program, which has more than 3.9 million active members as of December 31, 2014, provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our Speedway customer base with existing and new Speedway locations, including the stores recently acquired from Hess. 8Table of ContentsDeliver Top Quartile Refining PerformanceOur refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in North America, including the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Utica Shale regions, along with the Canadian oil sands. We are also well positioned to export distillates, gasoline and other products.We intend to enhance our margins in the Refining & Marketing segment by capturing synergies at our Galveston Bay refinery, increasing our condensate and light crude oil processing capacity, growing our distillate production and expanding our exports. For example, we recently completed construction of a condensate splitter at our Canton refinery and we have a project underway to increase condensate processing capacity at our Catlettsburg refinery. We also have projects to increase light crude oil processing capacity at our Robinson refinery, to increase distillate production at our Garyville, Louisiana; Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries and to expand the export capacity at our Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base, with an emphasis on increasing distillate production, light crude oil processing and export capabilities and synergistic opportunities at our Galveston Bay refinery.Sustain Focus on Shareholder ReturnsWe intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. We have increased our quarterly dividend by 150 percent since becoming a stand-alone company in June 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling $8.0 billion. Through open market purchases and two accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, we repurchased 89 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.27 billion, representing approximately 25 percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a stand-alone company in June 2011. After the effects of these repurchases, $1.73 billion of the $8.0 billion total authorization was available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2014.Increase Assured Sales Volumes at our Marathon Brand and Speedway LocationsWe consider assured sales as those sales we make to Marathon brand customers, our Speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts. We believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems, provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries, our pipelines and our terminals. The Marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets. The acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 mbpd of assured sales from our refining system.Utilize and Enhance our High Quality Employee WorkforceWe utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills. In addition, we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety, environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our competitive strengths and business strategies, including our expected investments, share repurchase authorizations, pursuit of potential acquisitions and other growth opportunities as well as the earnings potential of our portfolio of midstream assets and growth projects that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX. There can be no assurance that we will be successful, in whole or in part, in carrying out our business strategies, including our expected investments, share repurchase program or pursuit of potential acquisitions and other growth opportunities, or that our portfolio of midstream assets and growth projects that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX will achieve expected earnings. Factors that could affect our investments include, but are not limited to, the actual amounts invested, which could differ materially from those estimated, and our success in making such investments. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect the pursuit of potential acquisitions and other growth opportunities include, but are not limited to, our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives, availability of liquidity, actions taken by competitors, regulatory approvals and operating performance. Factors that could affect the earnings of our portfolio of midstream assets and growth projects that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX include, but are not limited to, the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for crude oil, refined products, feedstocks or other hydrocarbon-based products and volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and . Risk Factors. We estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products. Additionally, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable.Our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized.For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs.AirWe are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to this endangerment finding, in April 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources (cars and other light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the CAA, and the EPA’s so-called “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including refineries. Legal challenges filed against these EPA actions were overruled by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In June 2014, the Supreme Court limited the EPA’s greenhouse gas permitting authority to only those sources that also trigger Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) conventional pollutants. A few MPC projects triggered greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spend will likely not be significant. Legal challenges continue in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. The EPA has proposed New Source Performance Standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units. This could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations and could impose new requirements on the combined heat and power unit we operate. Congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax. Private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but such suits have been largely unsuccessful. We have not been named in any of those lawsuits. Private-party litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. In sum, requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. These requirements may also significantly affect MPC’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented.21Table of ContentsIn 2013, the Obama administration developed the social cost of carbon (“SCC”). The SCC is to be used by the EPA and other federal agencies in regulatory cost-benefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases. The SCC was first issued in 2010. In 2013, the Obama administration significantly increased the estimate to $36 per ton. In response to the regulated community and Congress’ critiques of how the SCC was developed, the Office of Management and Budget provided an opportunity to comment on the SCC, but ultimately did not make any significant revisions. In December 2014, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), adding for the first time language that requires the analyses to also include the impact of climate change on projects, including using the SCC when analyzing costs and benefits of a project. While the impact of a higher SCC in future regulations is not known at this time, it may result in increased costs to our operations.The EPA has reviewed and has revised, or will propose to revise, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for criteria air pollutants. The NAAQS are subject to multiple court challenges, making compliance planning uncertain. The EPA promulgated a revised ozone standard in March 2008 and commenced a multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the CAA. On December 17, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise the NAAQS for ozone. If the ozone standard is revised, it is expected to be effective in December 2015 after which states will begin developing implementation plans that will take several years to receive final EPA approval. The impact of a stricter standard cannot be accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding the final standard and the additional requirements that states may impose. Also, in 2010, the EPA adopted new short-term standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, and in December 2012 issued a more stringent fine particulate matter standard (“PM 2.5”). In December 2014, the EPA finalized the non-attainment areas for PM 2.5. None of our refineries are located in the non-attainment areas for PM 2.5, however, our Cincinnati Renewable Fuels LLC facility is located in Cincinnati, OH, which was designated as a non-attainment area. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised NAAQS standards until the standards are finalized, individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved.The EPA finalized the Boiler and Process Heater Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“Boiler MACT”) in March 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment. Subsequently, in January 2013 the EPA made certain revisions to the March 2011 final rule in response to petitions for reconsideration. In December 2014, the EPA proposed reconsideration of limited issues and proposed to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunctions. Currently, litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit Court on both the 2011 and 2013 rule-makings. We anticipate litigation to continue through 2015. We are in the process of implementing the work practice standards. Final financial impacts of the Boiler MACT rule cannot be determined at this time because the ongoing litigation could affect the final rule. On June 30, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise existing refinery air emissions standards. The final rule is expected to be issued by June 17, 2015 and allows for implementation through June 2018. EPA’s periodic review and possible revision of these standards is required under the CAA. This rule may require additional controls, lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring. Due to the present uncertainty regarding final standards, we cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with this rule.WaterWe maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements.Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service. All barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.22Table of ContentsIn 2013, the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers proposed significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the US” (WOTUS) used in numerous programs under the CWA. The proposed changes have the potential to expand permitting, planning and reporting obligations and extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities. Some man-made water bodies on our plant sites (firewater ponds, stormwater systems, and green infrastructure systems) may become WOTUS, which may require new permits requiring the control of liquids entering and exiting these water bodies. A final rule is anticipated in early 2015.In May 2014, the EPA issued the final rule regarding cooling water intake structures which impacts three of our refineries. The final rule established closed-loop cooling as one of eight required technologies. The final rule also requires company engagement with Fish and Wildlife to determine if any endangered species are at risk in the locations during the next NPDES permit cycle. This rule will apply with the next NPDES renewal at our Catlettsburg, Garyville, and Robinson refineries. This rule is not anticipated to have a material impact on our operations. Solid WasteWe continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs, however, are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows.RemediationWe own or operate, or have owned or operated, certain convenience stores and other locations where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery, terminal and pipeline locations. Penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance.Claims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA; however, we do not believe such costs will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Mileage Standards, Renewable Fuels and Other Fuels RequirementsIn 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS2”). In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking). New or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations.23Table of ContentsThe RFS2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to reach 16.55 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. EPA has not finalized the 2014 volumes at this time. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”), but blending more than E10 could be required if the RFS2 standards are not modified. The RFS2 has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. Within the overall 36.0 billion gallon RFS2, EISA established an advanced biofuel RFS2 volume of 2.0 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to 21.0 billion gallons in 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuel RFS2 include biomass-based diesel, which was set at 1.0 billion gallons in 2012, 1.28 billion gallons in 2013, and at least 1.0 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 (to be determined by the EPA through future rulemaking), and cellulosic biofuel, which was set at 0.5 billion gallons in 2012 and 1.0 billion gallons in 2013, increasing to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022. In 2013, the EPA used its waiver authority under the CAA to reduce the amount of cellulosic biofuel required under the statute from 1.0 billion gallons to 6.0 million gallons. Currently, litigation is on-going in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to the EPA’s determination of the 2013 cellulosic biofuel requirement. Subsequently, industry has requested the EPA to use its waiver authority for 2014, requesting reductions for total renewable fuel, advanced biofuels and cellulosic biofuels volumetric obligations.On November 29, 2013, the EPA issued a proposed rule for the 2014 renewal fuel volume requirements. On November 21, 2014, the EPA announced the rule would not become final until sometime in 2015. This continues the lack of clarity and timeliness that has become common place with the EPA’s administration of the RFS2 requirements. This proposed rule has substantially reduced the RFS2 requirements from the statutory numbers as follows: total renewables has been reduced from 18.15 to 15.21 billion gallons, the advanced requirement has been reduced from 3.75 to 2.20 billion gallons, the biomass-based diesel requirement has remained flat from 2013 at 1.28 billion gallons, and the cellulosic requirement has been reduced from 1.75 billion to 17 million gallons. If these proposed requirements become final, it will allow the obligated parties to comply in 2014 without needing any substantial volumes of 85 percent ethanol-blended or 15 percent ethanol-blended (“E15”) gasolines and postpone the issues and concerns of having to blend ethanol past the E10 “blendwall” at least for 2014. Likewise, the EPA has not finalized the 2015 renewable fuel volumes as required by the November 30, 2014 statutory deadline. As a result, the future of the RFS still remains undecided and is in need of a legislative re-write or repeal to provide a stable business platform for the obligated parties. With potentially uncertain supplies, the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel. Additionally, the EPA did not finalize the 2013 RFS2 renewable fuel obligations until August 2013. Therefore, it is uncertain how industry will comply with meeting the advanced biofuels obligation. The continued delay of the final rule for 2014 has also delayed the day when compliance reports are due for 2013. In 2012 and 2013, the EPA also discovered that 173 million biodiesel renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties, including MPC. The EPA finalized a rule establishing a quality assurance program for RINs purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. The program is aimed at reducing the risks that RINs are fraudulently created or sold. We have already instituted internal procedures to help mitigate that risk.We made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel RFS2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product, and by buying needed biodiesel RINs in the EPA-created biodiesel RINs market. On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, which currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million gallons per year. As a producer of biodiesel, we now generate RINs, thereby reducing our reliance on the external RIN market. On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from E10 to E15 for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. On January 21, 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model year 2001-2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines.There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in EISA and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million (“ppm”) beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. 24Table of ContentsTrademarks, Patents and LicensesOur Marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations, and our Speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the ownership of our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Risks Relating to our BusinessA substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend. Our operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. The measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, or crack spread, is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins. Historically, refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. We do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. The price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions. Any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins. Many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control. These factors include: •worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products; •the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks to be manufactured into refined products; •the prices realized for refined products; •utilization rates of refineries; •natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries; •the ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls; •political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; •local weather conditions; •seasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months; •natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; •the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; •domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and •local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions. Some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain. We purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. Price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. Significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend. 28Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. Failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, or other natural or man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism. For example, pipelines provide a nearly-exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. In such instances, a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations, profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery. Explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.We do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.We maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates. We rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems involve data network and telecommunications, Internet access and website functionality, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business. These systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We also face various other cyber-security threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. To protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans. There can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.The retail market is diverse and highly competitive, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business. We face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. Our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices. Several non-traditional retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, experienced management and greater financial resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. In addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. These activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts, adversely affecting our profit margins. Additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The development, availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business. We compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers. Increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability.29Table of ContentsWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products. We utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. A prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions. We currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future. A failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions. To the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective, we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred. We have significant debt obligations; therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally. At December 31, 2014, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were $6.7 billion. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future. Our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including: •increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions; •limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; •limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders; •limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes. A decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and/or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $1.3 billion depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables. In periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.30Table of ContentsHistoric or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate. We currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Approximately 38 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our Texas City and Detroit refineries are scheduled to expire in March 2015 and January 2019, respectively. The contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our Canton, Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries expired on January 31, 2015 and no successor agreements have been negotiated. In addition, three agreements scheduled to expire on September 14, 2015, March 14, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, cover certain Speedway LLC hourly employees at certain outlets in New York and New Jersey. These contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us. In addition, we have experienced, or may experience, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. Any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, MPLX, which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations. One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of MPLX, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of MPLX may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to MPLX. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels, we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which we refer to collectively as the Maritime Laws, generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of Marathon Oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with Marathon Oil that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Spinoff occurred in mid 2011, certain liabilities of Marathon Oil could become our obligations. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Marathon Oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and Marathon Oil. However, if Marathon Oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities. 31Table of ContentsAlso pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, following the Spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the Spinoff. We also agreed to be responsible for, and indemnify Marathon Oil with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the Spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the Spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. In addition, we agreed to indemnify Marathon Oil for specified tax-related liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from Ashland Inc. Our indemnification obligations to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. At this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts. The tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.The Spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction, and Marathon Oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Marathon Oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement. Marathon Oil received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the Spinoff qualifies as tax-free to Marathon Oil, us and Marathon Oil stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a) and related provisions of the Code. If the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then Marathon Oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling, the Spinoff were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, Marathon Oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares. With respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on Marathon Oil in connection with the Spinoff (and certain related transactions) as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling, we would be liable to Marathon Oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us, any of our affiliates, or any person that, after the Spinoff, is our affiliate. We may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement. If we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil for taxes incurred as a result of the Spinoff (or certain related transactions) being taxable to Marathon Oil, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with Marathon Oil in connection with the Spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Marathon Oil that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the Spinoff, certain conditions to the Spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and Marathon Oil with respect to and resulting from the Spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spinoff, as well as certain obligations of Marathon Oil assumed by us. Our obligations to indemnify Marathon Oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities. Marathon Oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by Marathon Oil, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Marathon Oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, that Marathon Oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that Marathon Oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the Spinoff. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Marathon Oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. If Marathon Oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 32Table of ContentsSignificant acquisitions involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.Significant transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses present potential risks, which may include, among others:•Inaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;•An inability to successfully integrate assets or businesses we acquire;•A decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;•A significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;•The assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;•The diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•The incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.Risks Relating to Our IndustryChanges in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations, which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin. Laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:•the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, •solid and hazardous waste management, •pollution prevention, •greenhouse gas emissions,•characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels,•public and employee safety and health, and•facility security.The specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes. We may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention, with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations. The U.S. pledge in 2009, as part of the Copenhagen Accord, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the President’s 2013 Climate Action Plan. Meetings of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, however, have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the U.S. Also in 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to the endangerment finding, in April 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and other light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding, the mobile source standard and the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources, but as a result of the EPA’s “tailoring rule,” permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries. Legal challenges were filed against these EPA actions. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration program for new and modified stationary sources is not triggered by greenhouse gas emissions alone. The U.S. Supreme Court did, however, uphold the requirement for new or modified stationary sources that will also emit a criteria pollutant to control greenhouse gas emissions through Best Available Control Technology. Implementing Best Available Control Technology may result in increased costs to our operations.33Table of ContentsIn 2013, the Obama administration developed the social cost of carbon (“SCC”). The SCC is to be used by the EPA and other federal agencies in regulatory cost-benefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases. The SCC was first issued in 2010. In 2013, the Obama administration significantly increased the estimate to $36 per ton. In response to the regulated community and Congress’ critiques of how the SCC was developed, the Office of Management and Budget provided an opportunity to comment on the SCC, but ultimately did not make any significant revisions. In December 2014, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), adding for the first time language that requires that analyses also include the impact of climate change on projects, including using the SCC when analyzing costs and benefits of a project. While the impact of a higher SCC in future regulations is not known at this time, it may result in increased costs to our operations.In 2013, the EPA proposed carbon emission standards for new power plants built in the future. In June 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants. Through the Plan, the EPA proposes to reduce nationwide carbon emissions from the power generation sector by 30 percent below 2005 levels. These standards, if finalized, could increase our electricity costs and potentially reduce the reliability of our electricity supply.In the future, Congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax. Other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the U.S. These measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions. Private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. These actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. In November 2014, the EPA proposed a tightening of the primary (health) ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) to within the range of 65 to 70 parts per billion (“ppb”), while accepting comments on levels as low as 60 ppb and an option of maintaining the current ozone level of 75 ppb. In addition, the EPA is asking for comment on a new secondary (welfare) ozone NAAQS using a three-month seasonal index. The final rule is expected to be promulgated in late 2015. If timely finalized, the EPA would then implement a revised ozone NAAQS with attainment and nonattainment designations by late 2017, using 2014-2016 air quality monitor data. A lower primary ozone standard may not by attainable in many areas and could result in the cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities.The EISA, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard commonly referred to as RFS2. In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking). Increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) may reduce demand for refined products. Governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations.The RFS2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to reach 16.55 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The RFS2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries, and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. Gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the EPA, which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met. As a result, the EPA delayed issuance of the 2014 RFS2 standards and has not finalized the 2015 renewable fuel volumes as required by the November 30, 2014 statutory deadline. The advanced biofuels program, a subset of the RFS2 requirements, creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply, and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations. Tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been, which may further reduce refined product margins. On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million (“ppm”) beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm, while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards.34Table of ContentsWe have in the past owned or operated, and currently own and operate, convenience stores and other locations with USTs in various states. The operation of USTs poses risks, including soil and groundwater contamination, at our previously or currently operated locations. Such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs, fines or civil liabilities. We have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites. Environmental laws, including CERCLA, and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed. Any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment.Plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.Our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. A portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets. However, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence of environmental and other special interest groups. The construction of new refinery processing units or crude oil or refined products pipelines, or the extension or expansion of existing assets, involve numerous political and legal uncertainties, many of which may cause significant delays or cost increases and most of which are beyond our control. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.Large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities  could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: •denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;•unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;•disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;•adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;•shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;•market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and•nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 35Table of ContentsThe availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins. The profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. A portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from Canada, the Middle East and various other international locations. The market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market. We are, therefore, subject to the attendant political, geographic and economic risks of such a market. If one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated, we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our operations, sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected, materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies, political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult and/or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. For example, the U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties. Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.The U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets in general, including the nation’s refining, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. The threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attacks on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.An easing or lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban could adversely affect crack spreads or crude oil price differentials and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Since the 1970s, the U.S. has restricted the ability of producers to export domestic crude oil. As total crude oil production has increased in the U.S. in recent years, primarily due to the increase in shale crude oil production, there have been increasing calls by crude oil producers and others for an easing or lifting of the crude oil export ban. If the export ban were to be significantly eased or lifted, the price of domestic crude oil would likely rise, potentially impacting crack spreads and price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils. A deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results or operations and cash flows.36Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common StockProvisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity. The existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions: •providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board; •providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms; •providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies; •limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders; •prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; •establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; •establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our amended and restated bylaws; •providing that our directors may only be removed for cause; •authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and •authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt. We believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. Finally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 23 percent. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. 37Table of ContentsItem 1B
