Additional information about the Merger Transaction and the Merger Agreement is set forth in the definitive registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-209869) (as amended, the Registration Statement) that includes a joint proxy statement of Dow and DuPont and that also constitutes a prospectus of DowDuPont and the company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2015.Spin-off of Performance ChemicalsOn July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).  In connection with the separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), the financial position and results of operations of the Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Productivity and Cost Savings InitiativesOn December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them.  In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs.  The restructuring actions associated with the charge are substantially complete and the plan delivered the target cost reductions in 2016 versus prior year.  Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions.  DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment.  Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign were essentially completed during 2015 and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $440 million year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Business SegmentsThe company consists of 7 businesses which are aggregated into 6 reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment.  The company's reportable segments are Agriculture, Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition & Health, Performance Materials and Protection Solutions. The company includes certain businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as pre-commercial programs, nonaligned businesses and pharmaceuticals in Other.  Additional information with respect to business segment results is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 31 of this report and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Effective January 1, 2016, the DuPont Packaging & Industrial Polymers business consolidated with the DuPont Performance Polymers business within the Performance Materials segment, and the DuPont Protection Technologies business consolidated with the DuPont Building Innovations business within the former Safety & Protection segment (now Protection Solutions).  The consolidations were undertaken to create greater efficiency and enhanced capabilities in the two segments where these businesses operate.  These changes did not result in a change in reportable segments.    3Part IITEM 1.  BUSINESS, continuedDuPont Sustainable Solutions, previously within the company's former Safety & Protection segment (now Protection Solutions), was comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions.  Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit became part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes.  The company is exploring a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 is reported within Other. Agriculture Agriculture businesses, DuPont Pioneer (Pioneer) and DuPont Crop Protection (Crop Protection), leverage the company's technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry.  Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area.  The segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and to enhance the value of grains and oilseeds through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.  Agriculture accounted for 57 percent of the company's total research and development expense in 2016. Sales of the company's products in this segment are affected by the seasonality of global agriculture markets and weather patterns. Sales and earnings performance in the Agriculture segment are significantly stronger in the first versus second half of the year reflecting the northern hemisphere planting season. As a result of the seasonal nature of its business, Agriculture's inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables in the Agriculture segment are at a low point at year-end and increase through the northern hemisphere selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.Pioneer is a world leader in developing, producing and marketing hybrid corn seed and soybean seed varieties which improve the productivity and profitability of its customers.  Additionally, Pioneer develops, produces and markets canola, sunflower, sorghum, wheat and rice seed, as well as silage inoculants.  As the world's population grows and the middle class expands, the need for crops for animal feed, food, biofuels and industrial uses continues to increase. The business competes with other seed and plant biotechnology companies.  Pioneer seed sales amounted to 27 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Pioneer's research and development focuses on integrating high yielding germplasm with value added proprietary and/or licensed native and biotechnology traits with local environment and service expertise.  Pioneer uniquely develops integrated products for specific regional application based on local product advancement and testing of the product concepts.  Research and development in this arena requires long-term commitment of resources, extensive regulatory efforts and collaborations, partnerships and business arrangements to successfully bring products to market. To protect its investment, the business employs the use of patents covering germplasm and native and biotechnology traits in accordance with country laws. Pioneer holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business.  The biotechnology traits licensed by Pioneer from third parties are contained in a variety of Pioneer crops, including corn hybrids and soybean varieties.  The majority of Pioneer’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long term licenses.                       Pioneer is actively pursuing the development of innovations for corn hybrids, soybean varieties, and canola, sunflower, wheat and rice seed based on market assessments of the most valuable opportunities.  In corn seeds, programs include innovations for insect protection, drought, yield and yield stability.  In soybean seeds, programs include products with enhanced end-use value and insect protection.  Pioneer has seed production facilities located throughout the world. Seed production is performed directly by the business or contracted with independent growers and conditioners. Pioneer's ability to produce seeds primarily depends upon growing conditions and availability of reliable contract growers.Pioneer markets and sells seed product primarily under the Pioneer® brand but also sells and distributes products utilizing additional brand names.  Pioneer promotes its products through multiple marketing channels around the world. In the corn and soybean markets of the U.S. Corn Belt, Pioneer® brand products are sold primarily through a specialized force of independent sales representatives. Outside of North America, Pioneer's products are marketed through a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures and independent producer-distributors.  4Part IITEM 1.

Protection Solutions net sales outside the U.S. accounted for 56 percent of the segment's total sales in 2016.BacklogIn general, the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand.  Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.Intellectual Property As a science and technology based company, DuPont believes that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting its research. Some DuPont businesses operate in environments in which the availability and protection of intellectual property rights affect competition.  Information on the importance of intellectual property rights to Pioneer is included in Item 1 Agriculture business discussion beginning on page 4 of this report. Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property.  Many of the processes used to make DuPont products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties.  DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets.  When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate.  In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment. Patents & Trademarks:  DuPont continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed.  DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country.  This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across segments.  At December 31, 2016, the company owned about 6,500 active U.S. patents and about 10,000 active patents outside of the U.S., of which about 55 and 30 percent, respectively, relate to the Agriculture segment. 7Part IITEM 1.

Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. Research and DevelopmentDuPont’s investment in research and development (R&D) was $1.6 billion in 2016, $1.9 billion in 2015 and $2.0 billion in 2014. DuPont conducts R&D activities to renew our portfolio, create new product lines, and transform markets to deliver results in the short, mid and long term. Each business in the company directs R&D activities that support its business objectives, and the company supports cross-business and cross-functional investment to incubate new science-intensive growth opportunities additive to the existing business portfolios. The R&D portfolio is managed by senior business and R&D leaders to ensure consistency with the corporate and business strategies and to capitalize on the application of emerging science. DuPont’s R&D leverages the company's unique world-class science, technology and engineering capabilities, deep understanding of markets and value chains, and research collaborations, to drive revenue and profit growth. The company protects its R&D investment through its intellectual property strategy.  See discussion under “Intellectual Property” beginning on page 7.Additional information with respect to R&D related to Agriculture is included on page 4.Environmental MattersInformation related to environmental matters is included in several areas of this report: (1) Environmental Proceedings beginning on page 18, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on pages 43, 48-50 and (3) Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Available InformationThe company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

RISK FACTORSRisks relating to the Mergers The risk factors below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other information related to the Mergers set forth in the Registration Statement and the risk factors related to the company’s operations set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.Before the Mergers may be completed, various approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objection must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Dow and DuPont have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as possible following the date of the Merger Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the foregoing, "reasonable best efforts" includes (i) the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of either party or its subsidiaries or affiliates and (ii) restrictions or actions that after the Effective Time would limit DowDuPont's or its subsidiaries' or affiliates' freedom of action or operations with respect to retaining, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries' businesses, product lines or assets. These regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals and if such regulatory and governmental entities seek to impose such conditions, lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, DuPont and Dow. Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Mergers and such conditions may not be satisfied for an extended period of time. Such conditions may also impose additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the completion of the Mergers, including the requirement that the respective Dow and DuPont businesses divest certain assets if necessary in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals, and may limit the ability of the combined company to integrate parts of the DuPont and Dow businesses and negatively impact the ultimate composition of the entities we expect to constitute in connection with the Intended Business Separations. These conditions may therefore reduce the anticipated benefits of the Mergers, which could also have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business and cash flows and results of operations, and DuPont cannot predict what, if any, changes may be required by regulatory or governmental authorities whose approvals are required. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, and may contain conditions on the completion of the Mergers.DuPont or Dow may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.DuPont or Dow may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to its obligations to consummate the Mergers. DuPont or Dow currently expect to evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on DuPont stockholders or Dow stockholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of the Registration Statement or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to waive any condition to the Mergers or as to re-soliciting stockholder approval or amending the Registration Statement as a result of the waiver will be made by DuPont or Dow, as applicable, at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Mergers may not be completed. The completion of the Mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Those conditions include: (i) the receipt of certain domestic and foreign regulatory approvals under competition laws, including the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) the absence of certain governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing completion of the DuPont Merger or the Dow Merger; (iii) the approval of the shares of DowDuPont Common Stock to be issued to DuPont stockholders and Dow stockholders for listing on the NYSE; (iv) the reasonable determination by DuPont and Dow that neither the DuPont Merger nor the Dow Merger will constitute an acquisition of a 50 percent or greater interest in Dow or DuPont, under Section 355(e) of the Code; (v) the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties made by both parties (generally subject to certain “materiality” and “material adverse effect” qualifiers); (vi) the performance by DuPont and Dow of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and (vii) the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels with respect to the tax-free nature of each of the Mergers. 9Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThese conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Mergers may not be completed. In addition, if the Mergers are not completed by March 15, 2017 (subject to extension to June 15, 2017, by either party if certain antitrust-related conditions to the closing have not been satisfied), either DuPont or Dow may choose not to proceed with the Mergers, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Mergers. In addition, DuPont or Dow may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, Dow and DuPont may incur substantial fees in connection with termination of the Merger Agreement and will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers.Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact DuPont. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Mergers are not consummated, the ongoing businesses of DuPont may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. DuPont's respective businesses may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Mergers, by the failure to obtain the anticipated benefits of completing the Mergers, by payment of certain costs relating to the Mergers, and by the focus of DuPont's management on the Mergers for an extended period of time rather than on management opportunities or other issues. The market price of DuPont common stock might decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Mergers will be completed.In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, DuPont or Dow may be required to pay a termination fee of $1.9 billion to the other party, depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. DuPont may also be negatively impacted if the Merger Agreement is terminated and it seeks but is unable to find another business combination or strategic transaction offering equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Mergers, or if DuPont becomes subject to litigation related to entering into or failing to consummate the Mergers, including direct actions by DuPont stockholders against the directors and/or officers of DuPont for breaches of fiduciary duty, and stockholder derivative actions. There can be no assurance that the expected benefits of the Mergers, including the Intended Business Separations, will occur or be fully or timely realized.The success of the Mergers will depend, in part, on the combined company’s ability to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow. If the combined company is not able to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow in an efficient and effective manner, including if the Intended Business Separations are delayed or ultimately not consummated, the anticipated benefits, synergies, operational efficiencies and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of common stock, the revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations of the combined company may be adversely affected.The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time consuming process, and the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, including, without limitation:•latent impacts resulting from the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the Mergers and resulting performance shortfalls;•ongoing diversion of the attention of management from the operation of the combined company’s business as a result of the Intended Business Separations;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects; •difficulties in managing a larger combined company addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process, including with respect to the Intended Business Separations;•unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company and the Intended Business Separations;•coordinating geographically separate organizations; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Mergers. 10Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedSome of these factors will be outside of the control of management and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenues which could materially impact the company’s business, financial conditions and results of operations. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Mergers may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom DuPont and Dow have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of DuPont and Dow could harm the reputation of the combined company.If the combined company is not able to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Mergers (including the Intended Business Separations) may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of DowDuPont common stock, the revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to integrate successfully DuPont’s and Dow’s operations, effect the Intended Business Separations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions.DuPont will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions until the Mergers are consummated.Uncertainty about the completion or effect of the Mergers on employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and licensees as well as regulatory permits, licenses, contracts and other agreements, particularly for which the Mergers could be deemed a “change-in-control” under the applicable  terms and conditions may have an adverse effect on DuPont, Dow and consequently on the combined company.  Changes to existing business relationships, including termination or modification, could negatively affect each of DuPont’s and/or Dow's revenues, earnings and cash flow, as well as the market price of its common stock.  These uncertainties may impair each party’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the consummation of the Mergers, and could cause suppliers, customers and others that deal with the parties to seek to change existing business relationships with them. Retention of employees could be challenging during the pendency of the Mergers due to uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company’s business following the consummation of the Mergers could be negatively impacted. Further, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of DuPont and Dow to the same extent that DuPont and Dow have previously been able to attract or retain their employees.In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts each of DuPont and Dow, without the consent of the other party, from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds, repurchasing or issuing securities outside of existing share repurchase and equity award programs, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the Mergers or the termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions may prevent or delay pursuit of strategic corporate or business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Mergers. Adverse effects arising during the pendency of the Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement.Inability to access the debt capital markets could impair DuPont's liquidity, business or financial condition.DuPont has relied and continues to rely on access to the debt capital markets to finance its day-to-day and long-term operations. In connection with the Mergers, Dow and DuPont do not intend for DowDuPont to incur debt obligations or guarantee the debt obligations of Dow or DuPont. Any limitation on DuPont’s ability to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity. Access to the debt capital markets in amounts adequate to finance DuPont's activities could be impaired as a result of the existence of material nonpublic information about the Intended Business Separations and other potential factors, including factors that are not specific to DuPont, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations.DuPont expects to incur substantial transaction-related costs in the connection with the Mergers. DuPont expects to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the company incurred transaction-related costs of $386 million and $10 million, respectively.  The substantial majority of these costs are and will continue to be expenses relating to the Mergers and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning.  These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operation of DuPont prior to the Mergers and of the combined company following the Mergers. 11Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThe determination to proceed with the Intended Business Separations will not be made at the time of the consummation of the Mergers, and the expected benefits of such transactions, if they occur, will be uncertain.In connection with the Mergers, Dow and DuPont have announced their intention that the combined company will pursue the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, material science business and specialty products business through one or more tax-efficient transactions, resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. However, consummation of the Mergers is not conditioned on the Intended Business Separations, and the determination as to whether to pursue such transactions will be made by the DowDuPont Board following the consummation of the Mergers. Following the consummation of the Mergers, the DowDuPont Board may ultimately determine to abandon one or more of the Intended Business Separations, and such determination could have an adverse impact on the value of the combined company. Additionally, there are many determinations with respect to the Intended Business Separations that, by their nature, cannot be determined until the completion of the Mergers, including definitive determinations with regard to the capital structure of the various businesses and allocation of liabilities among them. As such, there are many factors that could, through the closing and prior to the determination by the DowDuPont Board to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, impact the structure or timing of, the anticipated benefits from, or determination to ultimately proceed with, the Intended Business Separations, including, among others, global economic conditions, instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates, tax considerations, and other challenges that could affect the global economy, specific market conditions in one or more of the industries of the businesses proposed to be separated, and changes in the regulatory or legal environment. Such changes could adversely impact the value of one or more of the Intended Business Separations to the combined company’s stockholders. Additionally, to the extent the DowDuPont Board determines to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, the consummation of such transactions is a complex, costly and time consuming process, and there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of such transactions will be achieved. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Intended Business Separations, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the agriculture business, the specialty products business, the material science business and/or the combined company.Risks Related to the Company’s Operations The company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the company believes that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect its businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.The company’s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.The company’s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, including fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad.  Although DuPont has operations throughout the world, sales outside the U.S. in 2016 were principally to customers in Eurozone countries, China, Brazil, and Japan. Further, the company’s largest currency exposures are the European euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real, and the Japanese yen.  Market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for the company’s products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on DuPont’s results of operations.  In addition, changes in exchange rates may affect the company’s results from operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.  The company actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, committed currency purchases and sales, foreign currency-denominated revenues and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.  Volatility in energy and raw materials costs could have a significant impact on the company's sales and earnings.The company's manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the company. Significant variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil, natural gas, and raw materials affect the company's operating results from period to period. Legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility.  12Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedWhen possible, the company purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Additionally, the company enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. The company takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If the company is not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs, it could have a significant impact on the company's financial results.The company's results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.Business and/or supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm the company's operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could result in misuse of the company's assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance.  Like most major corporations, the company is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. The company has determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to at least certain confidential business information. However, to date, the company has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or business operations that it attributes to these attacks. Although management does not believe that the company has experienced any material losses to date related to security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. The company actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, the company may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact sales and earnings from the company’s Agriculture segment.The agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors, which can vary unpredictably from period to period. Weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and, accordingly, can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products, including the mix of products used. The weather also can affect the quality, volume and cost of seeds produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Seed yields can be higher or lower than planned, which could lead to higher inventory and related-write-offs and affect the ability to supply.Inability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company's financial results.The company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property estates, including intellectual property rights supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products, particularly agricultural and bio-based products. Speed in discovering, developing and protecting new technologies and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage. Failure to predict and respond effectively to this competition could cause the company's existing or candidate products to become less competitive, adversely affecting sales. Competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact the company's ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.Intellectual property rights, including patents, plant variety protection, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and other forms of trade dress, are important to the company's business. The company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported.  However, the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions. 13Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThe company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property. Despite these precautions, the company's intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, the company reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. Accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant. See Part I, Item 1 for additional details on the company's intellectual property.Market acceptance, government policies, rules, regulations and competition could affect the company's ability in certain markets to generate and sustain sales or affect profitability from products based on biotechnology.The company is using biotechnology to create and improve products, particularly in its Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences segments. The company is also using biotechnology in the development of certain products and pre-commercial programs in Other.  These products enable cost and process benefits, better product performance and functionality, and improve environmental outcomes in a broad range of products, technologies and processes such as seeds, enzymes, animal nutrition, detergents, food ingredients, ethanol production and industrial applications. The company's ability to generate and sustain sales from such products could be impacted by market acceptance, including perception of benefits and costs relative to products based on conventional technologies, as well as governmental policies, laws and regulations that affect the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, particularly the testing and planting of seeds containing biotechnology traits and the import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds.In order to maintain its right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products containing biotechnology traits, particularly seed products, the company must be able to demonstrate its ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies. Sales into and use of seeds with biotechnology traits in jurisdictions where cultivation has been approved could be affected if key import markets have not approved the import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds. If import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds containing such biotechnology traits occurs in these markets, it could lead to disruption in trade and potential liability for the company.In addition, the company’s regulatory compliance could be affected by the detection of low level presence of biotechnology traits in conventional seed or products produced from such seed. Furthermore, the detection of biotechnology traits not approved in the country of cultivation may affect the company’s ability to supply product and could affect exports of products produced from such seeds and even result in crop destruction or product recalls.DuPont’s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for some of its products in the Agriculture segment could limit sales or affect profitability in certain markets.In most jurisdictions, the company must test the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of its Agricultural products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the necessary approvals. In certain jurisdictions the company must periodically renew its approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards. The regulatory environment is lengthy, complex and in some markets unpredictable,  with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. The regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance.  Responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability.  The failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products. 14Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our future results.From time to time, the company evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit its business and/or growth objectives. If the company is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, the company could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. The company continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. However, the company may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the company’s earnings. Moreover, the company might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings.The company's business, including its results of operations and reputation, could be adversely affected by process safety and product stewardship issues. Failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with the company's products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, the environment, the company's reputation and its results of operations. Public perception of the risks associated with the company's products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which the company operates. While the company has procedures and controls to manage process safety risks, issues could be created by events outside of its control including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and substandard performance by third parties with which the company collaborates.As a result of the company's current and past operations, including operations related to divested businesses, the company could incur significant environmental liabilities.The company is subject to various laws and regulations around the world governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result of its operations, including its past operations and operations of divested businesses, the company could incur substantial costs, including remediation and restoration costs. The costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. The company's accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs. At December 31, 2016, the company had recognized a liability of $457 million related to the matters. Since considerable uncertainty exists, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $900 million above the amount accrued at December 31, 2016. As described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement in connection with the spin-off of Chemours on July 1, 2015.  Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $457 million, that have an estimated liability of $250 million as of December 31, 2016 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $500 million above the amount accrued.  As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $250 million corresponding to the company’s accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2016. If the company could no longer continue to recognize the related indemnification asset due to potential disputes related to recovery or solvency of Chemours, it could adversely impact DuPont’s financial position and results of operations. Additional details on the company’s risks associated with environmental laws, regulations and environmental liabilities can be found in Part I, Item 1, Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 48 of this report and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 15Part IITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS, continuedThe company's results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.The company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability, patent infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries. The company also has noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company's financial results.In the ordinary course of business, the company may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations. If the company were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting the company's results of operations.Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Chemours indemnifies DuPont against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. If the company could no longer continue to recognize the related indemnification asset due to potential disputes related to recovery or solvency of Chemours, it could adversely impact DuPont’s financial position and results of operations.  16Part IITEM 1B
