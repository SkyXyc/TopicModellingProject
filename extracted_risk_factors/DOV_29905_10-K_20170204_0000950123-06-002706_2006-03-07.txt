    Risk
    Factors





 


    Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash
    flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not
    limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause
    our actual results to vary materially

    from recent results or from anticipated future results. For a
    discussion identifying additional risk factors and important
    factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those anticipated, see the discussion in “SPECIAL
    NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” included
    in this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Cyclical
    Economic Conditions May Affect our Financial
    Performance


 


    A meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue, most notably
    from the Circuit Assembly and Test group in the Technologies
    segment, is derived from companies in capital goods markets that
    are subject to inherently unpredictable business cycles. As a
    result, the revenue and operating performance of these companies
    in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their
    revenue and operating performance in other periods, and could
    have a material impact on Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.


 


    In addition, Dover is subject to substantially the same risk
    factors as other
    U.S.-based
    industrial manufacturers. However, except as noted above, the
    structure of Dover and the many different markets its companies
    serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors
    will materially impact Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.
