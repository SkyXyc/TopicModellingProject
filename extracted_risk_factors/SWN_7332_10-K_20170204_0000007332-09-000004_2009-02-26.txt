name="ITEM 1. BUSINESS">ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Southwestern Energy
Company is an independent energy company primarily engaged in natural gas and
crude oil exploration, development and production (E&P) within the United
States.  We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value
through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as
Midstream Services.  

Exploration and
Production - Our primary business is the exploration for and production of
natural gas within the United States, with our current operations being
principally focused on development of the unconventional gas reservoir located
on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which we refer to as the Fayetteville
Shale play.  We are also actively engaged in exploration and production
activities in Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania.  We primarily conduct our
exploration and production operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
SEECO, Inc. and Southwestern Energy Production Company, or SEPCO. SEECO has
historically operated exclusively in Arkansas. It holds a large base of both
developed and undeveloped gas reserves in Arkansas and conducts the drilling
programs for the Fayetteville Shale play and the conventional drilling program
in the Arkansas part of the Arkoma Basin. SEPCO conducts development drilling
and exploration programs in the Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma Basin, Texas and
Pennsylvania.  DeSoto Drilling, Inc., or DDI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
SEPCO, operates drilling rigs in the Fayetteville Shale play and in East
Texas.

Midstream Services
- Our Midstream Services segment primarily supports our E&P operations
and is currently concentrated on the Fayetteville Shale play. Midstream Services
generates revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of
natural gas to market and through the marketing of our own gas production and
some third-party natural gas.  We engage in gas gathering activities in
Arkansas and Texas through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company,
L.L.C. and Angelina Gathering Company, L.L.C. Our gas marketing subsidiary,
Southwestern Energy Services Company, or SES, captures downstream opportunities
which arise through marketing and transportation activity.

align=justify>The vast majority of our operating income and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or EBITDA, is derived
from our E&P business.  In 2008, 92% of our operating income and 89% of
our EBITDA were generated from our E&P business<A
name=OLE_LINK34>, compared to 94% of our operating income and 95% of our
EBITDA in 2007 and 96% of our operating income and 93% of our EBITDA in 2006.
 In 2008, 7% of our operating income and 5% of our EBITDA were generated
from Midstream Services, compared to 3% of our operating income and 3% of our
EBITDA in 2007 and 2% of our operating income and 1% of our EBITDA in 2006.
 In 2008, 1% of our operating income and 1% of our EBITDA were generated
from our Gas Distribution business which was sold effective July 1, 2008,
compared to 3% of our operating income and 2% of our EBITDA in 2007 and 2% of
our operating income and 3% of our EBITDA in 2006.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP
measure.  We refer you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation of
Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that
reconciles EBITDA with our net income.
Our Business
Strategy
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We are focused on providing long-term growth in the net asset
value of our business.  In our E&P business, we prepare an economic
analysis for each investment opportunity based upon the expected present value
added for each dollar to be invested, which we refer to as Present Value Index,
or PVI.  The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is
determined using a 10% discount rate.  We target creating at least $1.30 of
discounted pre-tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P projects.
 Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of
our future capital investments.  The key elements of our business strategy
are:

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 24px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Exploit and Develop Our Position in the Fayetteville Shale.
 We seek to maximize the value of our significant acreage position in the
Fayetteville Shale play, which we believe provides us with significant
production and reserve growth potential.  We intend to continue to develop
our acreage position and improve our well results through the use of advanced
technologies and detailed technical analysis of our properties.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 24px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Maximize Efficiency through Economies of Scale.
 In our key operating areas, the concentration of our properties allows
us to achieve economies of scale that result in lower costs.  In our
Fayetteville Shale play, we have achieved significant cost savings by operating
a fleet of drilling rigs designed specifically for the play.  We seek to
serve as the operator of the wells in which we have a significant interest.
 As the operator, we are better positioned to control the timing and plans
for future enhancement and exploitation efforts, the costs of enhancing,
drilling, completing and producing the wells, and the marketing negotiations for
our gas production to maximize both production volumes and realized price.

align=justify>Enhancing Our Overall Returns through Expanding Our Midstream
Operations.  We seek to maximize profitability by exercising
control over the delivery of natural gas from the areas where we have
production.  We seek to achieve this by continuing to improve upon and add
to our gas gathering infrastructure, which we believe allows us to better manage
the physical movement of our production and the costs of our operations. As of
December 31, 2008, we have invested approximately $342.3 million in building a
gas gathering system in the Fayetteville Shale play which was gathering
approximately 802 MMcf per day through 843 miles of gathering lines. We intend
to invest $220 million in our Midstream operations in 2009 to continue the
expansion of our infrastructure. We have also been pro-active in encouraging the
construction of interstate pipelines to provide access to additional markets for
our production. Our marketing subsidiary is a “foundation shipper” on two
pipeline projects being developed for the Fayetteville Shale play. These
projects will provide access to the eastern United States which will provide new
opportunities for us to maximize the realized price for our production.

align=justify>Grow through New Exploration and Development Activities.
 We actively seek to find and develop new oil and gas plays with
significant exploration and exploitation potential, which we refer to as “New
Ventures.” New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on repeatability,
multi-well potential and land availability as well as other criteria, and can be
located both inside and outside of the United States.  Our Fayetteville
Shale play began as a New Venture project in 2002.  As of December 31,
2008, we held 138,638 net undeveloped acres in New Ventures projects, which
includes approximately 114,738 net undeveloped acres targeting the Devonian-aged
Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In addition to New Ventures prospects, we also
seek to enter into and develop oil and gas resources through strategic
opportunities to expand existing operations including joint ventures, farm-ins
or farm-outs.
Recent
Developments
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Marcellus Shale Acreage Acquisition.  In the first
quarter of 2009, we purchased approximately 21,715 net acres in Lycoming County,
Pennsylvania, for approximately $8.2 million. Including this acreage
acquisition, we currently have approximately 137,000 net undeveloped acres in
Pennsylvania as of February 23, 2009, under which we believe the Marcellus Shale
is prospective.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>2009 Planned Capital Investments and Production Guidance.
 Our planned capital investment program for 2009 is $1.9 billion, which
includes approximately $1.6 billion for our E&P segment, $220 million for
our Midstream Services segment, and $40 million for other corporate purposes.
 Our 2009 capital program is expected to be primarily funded by net cash
flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our $1 billion revolving credit
facility. The planned capital program for 2009 is flexible and can be modified,
including downward, if the low natural gas price environment persists for an
extended period of time.  We will reevaluate our proposed investments as
needed to take into account prevailing market conditions. Based on our capital
program, we also announced our targeted 2009 gas and oil production of
approximately 280 to 284 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 45% over our 2008
production.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Pipeline Precedent Agreement.  On October 1, 2008, our
marketing subsidiary, SES, signed a precedent agreement pursuant to which it
will contract as a “foundation shipper” for firm transportation services on a
proposed new natural gas pipeline of Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, which is
jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer
Partners, L.P. SES will use the new pipeline primarily to deliver gas volumes
produced from our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.  Pending
regulatory approvals, the pipeline is expected to be in-service by late 2010 or
early 2011. 
Exploration and
Production
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our operations are primarily focused on the Fayetteville Shale, an
unconventional reservoir located in the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas.  In
addition to our significant position in the Fayetteville Shale, we conduct
conventional operations in the Arkoma Basin where we target Atokan-age gas
reservoirs and in East Texas where we primarily target the James Lime formation.
We also hold a significant acreage position in northeastern Pennsylvania, under
which we believe the Marcellus Shale is prospective.  We will continue to
actively seek to develop conventional and unconventional natural gas and oil
resource plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Operating income from our E&P segment was $813.5 million in
2008, compared to $358.1 million in 2007 and $237.3 million in 2006.
 EBITDA from our E&P segment was $1.2 billion in 2008, compared to
$640.5 million in 2007 and $386.4 million in 2006.  The increases in both
our operating income and EBITDA in 2008 and 2007 were due to increased
production volumes and higher realized prices, partially offset by increases in
operating costs and expenditures.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer
you to “Business — Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1
of Part I of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of EBITDA with our net
income.

align=justify>Our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves were 2,185 Bcfe
at year-end 2008, compared to 1,450 Bcfe at year-end 2007 and 1,026 Bcfe at
year-end 2006. The overall increase in total estimated proved reserves in the
past three years is primarily due to the discovery and development of the
Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas.  The after-tax PV-10, or standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas and oil
reserve quantities, was $2.1 billion at year-end 2008, compared to $2.0 billion
at year-end 2007 and $1.0 billion at year-end 2006.  The reconciling
difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is
reconciled in the 2008 Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted
value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our year-end
2008 estimated proved reserves had a present value of estimated future net cash
flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $3.0 billion, compared to $2.6
billion at year-end 2007 and $1.3 billion at year-end 2006.  We
believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our
estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax
PV-10 value.  While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount
factors that are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is
dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.  We
understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the
value of a company’s current proved reserves and to compare relative values
among peer companies without regard to income taxes.  At year-end 2008, the
market prices for natural gas and crude oil that were used to calculate our
PV-10 value were $5.71 per Mcf and $41.00 per barrel, respectively, compared to
$6.80 per Mcf and $92.50 per barrel at year-end 2007 and $5.64 per Mcf and
$57.25 per barrel at year-end 2006.  We refer you to Note 8 in the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure
of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas and oil
reserves, to the risk factor “Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve
data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate”
in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K, and to “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement
about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and
estimated reserve data.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Approximately 100% of our year-end 2008 estimated proved reserves
were natural gas and 62% were classified as proved developed, compared to 96%
and 64%, respectively, in 2007 and 95% and 65%, respectively, in 2006. We
operate approximately 95% of our reserves, based on our pre-tax PV-10 value, and
our average reserve life approximated 11.2 years at year-end 2008. Sales of
natural gas production accounted for 97% of total operating revenues for this
segment in 2008, 94% in 2007 and 91% in 2006. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The reserve replacement ratio is an important analytical measure
used within the E&P industry by investors and peers to evaluate performance
results. There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure as it does
not reflect the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of
the reserve additions. Our reserve replacement ratio has averaged over 400%
during the last three years, primarily driven by increases in the reserves
associated with our Fayetteville Shale play. In 2008, we replaced 523% of our
production volumes with an increase of 920.2 Bcfe of proved natural gas and oil
reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward revisions of 98.1
Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 568.2 Bcfe were proved developed and 352.0
Bcfe were proved undeveloped.  The upward reserve revisions during 2008
were primarily due to improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale
play, partially offset by downward reserve revisions of 58.7 Bcfe due to a
comparative decrease in year-end gas prices and performance revisions in our
conventional Arkoma and East Texas operating areas. Additionally, our reserves
decreased by 89.5 Bcfe as a result of our sale of oil and gas leases and wells
in 2008.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2007, our reserve replacement ratio was 474% (from reserve
additions of 507.9 Bcfe primarily driven by our drilling program in the
Fayetteville Shale play), including net upward revisions of 31.0 Bcfe. Of the
2007 reserve additions, 281.2 Bcfe were proved developed and 226.7 Bcfe
were proved undeveloped.  The upward reserve revisions during 2007 were
primarily due to improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale
play.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2006, our reserve replacement ratio was 386% (from reserve
additions of 365.5 Bcfe primarily driven by our drilling programs in the
Fayetteville Shale play, East Texas and conventional Arkoma), including net
downward reserve revisions of 86.6 Bcfe.  Of the 2006 reserve additions,
153.6 Bcfe were proved developed and 211.9 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The
downward reserve revisions during 2006 were primarily due to a comparative
decrease in year-end gas prices, combined with performance revisions in our East
Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin properties, which were partially offset by
an upward performance revision in our Fayetteville Shale properties. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>For the period ending December 31, 2008, our three-year
average reserve replacement ratio, including revisions, was 483%. Our reserve
replacement ratio for 2008, excluding the effect of reserve revisions, was 473%,
compared to 447% in 2007 and 505% in 2006. Excluding reserve revisions, our
three-year average reserve replacement ratio is 471%.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Since 2005, the substantial majority of our reserve additions have
been generated from our drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play.
 We expect our drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale to continue to be
the primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability
to add reserves is dependent upon a number of factors that are beyond our
control.  We refer you to the risk factors “Our drilling plans for the
Fayetteville Shale play are subject to

change” and “Our
exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may
not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns” in Item 1A of Part I of this
Form 10-K and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking
Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed
discussion of these factors and other risks.

The development of our
proved undeveloped reserves will require us to make significant additional
investments.  We expect that our proved undeveloped reserves of
840 Bcfe as of December 31, 2008, will require us to invest an
additional $1.5 billion in order for those reserves to be brought to
production.  Our 2008 proved undeveloped reserve additions are expected to
be developed and to begin to generate cash inflows over the next five years.
 Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash
inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control.  A
significant decrease in price levels for an extended period of time could result
in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce, leading to both lower
proved reserves and cash flows. We refer you to the risk factors “A substantial
or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse
affect on us,” “We may have difficulty financing our planned capital
investments, which could adversely affect our growth” and “Our future level of
indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect
operations and limit our growth” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K and to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of
Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these factors and
other risks.

Late in 2008, the SEC
adopted major revisions to its required oil and gas reporting disclosures which
become effective as of January 1, 2010.  Among other things, the amendments
provide for the use of the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted
arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the
12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period for purposes of both
the disclosure and full-cost accounting rules. The use of new technologies to
determine proved reserves is permitted under the new rules, and allows companies
to disclose probable and possible reserves to investors unlike current rules
which limit disclosure to only proved reserves. The new disclosure requirements
also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of the
auditor of the reserve estimates and file reports when a third party is relied
upon to prepare reserve estimates. The requirements will be effective for annual
reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009.

The following table
provides information as of December 31, 2008, related to proved reserves, well
count, net acreage and PV-10, and 2008 annual information related to production
and capital investments for each of our operating areas:

Fayetteville
Shale Play
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our Fayetteville Shale play is now the primary focus of our
E&P business.  The Fayetteville Shale is an unconventional gas
reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in thickness
from 50 to 550 feet and ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet.  The
shale is a Mississippian-age shale that is the geologic equivalent of the Caney
Shale found on the Oklahoma side of the Arkoma Basin and the Barnett Shale found
in north Texas.  At December 31, 2008, we held leases for approximately
875,000 net acres in the play area (552,254 net undeveloped acres, 197,481 net
developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale production, 123,442 net developed
acres held by conventional production and an additional 1,930 net undeveloped
acres in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin) down slightly from
approximately 906,700 net acres at year-end 2007 due to the sale of 55,631 acres
to XTO Energy, Inc. Approximately 1,545 Bcf of our reserves at year-end 2008
were attributable to our Fayetteville Shale play, compared to approximately 716
Bcf at year-end 2007 and 300 Bcf at year-end 2006.  Gross production from
our operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play increased from approximately
325 MMcf per day at the beginning of 2008 to approximately 720 MMcf per day by
year-end.  Approximately 8 MMcf per day of our production at December 31,
2008 was from 22 wells producing from conventional reservoirs located in five
counties. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 134.5 Bcf in
2008, compared to 53.5 Bcf in 2007 and 11.8 Bcf in 2006. In 2009, our estimated
production from the Fayetteville Shale play is expected to range between 229 and
232 Bcf.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our leases generally require that we drill at least one producing
well per governmental drilling unit (640 acres) in order to prevent our leases
from expiring upon the expiration date.  At year-end 2008, approximately
26
% of our leasehold acreage was held by production, <A
name=OLE_LINK11>excluding our acreage in the
traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin.  We refer you to the risk
factor “If we fail to drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our
Fayetteville Shale acreage, the initial lease terms could expire, which would
result in the loss of certain leasehold rights” in Item 1A of Part I of this
Form 10-K.  Excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway, our
undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2008 had an average lease term
of 5 years, an average royalty interest of 15% and was obtained at an average
cost of $140 per acre.  For more information about our acreage and well
count, we refer you to “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-K.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>As of December 31, 2008, we had spud a total of 1,230 wells in the
play, 1,015 of which were operated by us and 215 of which were outside-operated
wells.  Of the wells spud, 604 were in 2008, 415 were in 2007 and 196 were
in 2006.  Of the wells spud in 2008, 586 were designated as horizontal
wells.  At year-end 2008, 804 wells had been drilled and completed,
including 726 horizontal wells.  Of the 726 horizontal wells, 678 wells
were fracture stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel stimulation
treatments, or a combination thereof.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>During 2008, we continued to improve our drilling practices in the
Fayetteville Shale play.  Our horizontal wells had an average completed
well cost of $3.0 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 3,619
feet and average time to drill to total depth of 14 days from re-entry to
re-entry.  This compares to an average completed well cost of $2.9 million
per well, average horizontal lateral length of 2,657 feet and average time to
drill to total depth of 17 days from re-entry to re-entry during 2007.  In
2006, our average completed well cost was $2.8 million per well with an average
horizontal lateral length of 2,298 feet and average time to drill to total depth
of 18 days from re-entry to re-entry.  We also continued to improve our
completion practices, as wells placed on production during 2008 averaged initial
production rates

of 2,777 Mcf per
day, compared to average initial production rates of 1,687 Mcf per day and 1,510
Mcf per day in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  During 2008, we began to test
closer perforation cluster spacing in our horizontal wells with positive
results.  We tested this technique on approximately 200 of our wells which
resulted in a 20% to 25% improvement in early production over average initial
production of wells on which we did not utilize this technique.  We
estimate that ultimate recovery on these wells could be improved by a
corresponding 20% to 25% over wells on which we did not utilize this technique
and we are currently planning to utilize this technique on all planned wells in
2009.  As part of our 2009 drilling program, we will also focus on
optimizing the well spacing for the play.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our total proved net gas reserves booked in the play at year-end
2008 were 1,545 Bcf from a total of 1,508 locations, of which 882 were proved
developed producing, 18 were proved developed non-producing and 608 were proved
undeveloped.  Of the 1,508 locations, 1,446 were horizontal. The average
gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells included in our year-end
reserves was approximately 1.9 Bcf, up from 1.5 Bcf per well at year-end 2007
and 1.15 Bcf per well at year-end 2006.  Our gross proved reserves for
wells that were placed on production in the second half of 2008 averaged 2.2 Bcf
per well.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in 2007 totaled
approximately 716 Bcf from a total of 935 locations, of which 497 were proved
developed producing, 14 were proved developed non-producing and 424 were proved
undeveloped.  Total proved gas reserves booked in the play in 2006 totaled
approximately 300 Bcf from a total of 434 locations, of which 162 were proved
developed producing, 9 were proved developed non-producing and 263 were proved
undeveloped.  If the Fayetteville Shale play continues to be successfully
developed, over the next few years, we expect a continued significant level of
proved undeveloped reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2008, we invested approximately $1.2 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which included approximately $1.0 billion to spud 604
wells, and increased our reserves by 984 Bcf, which included upward reserve
revisions of 159 Bcf due primarily to improved well performance in our
Fayetteville Shale play.  Included in this total was $23 million for
leasehold acquisition, $61 million for seismic, and $83 million in capitalized
costs and other expenses.  In 2007, we invested approximately $960 million
in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included $789 million to spud 415 wells,
$25 million for leasehold acquisition, $97 million for 3-D seismic, and $49
million in capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2006, we invested
approximately $388 million, which included $316 million to spud 196 wells, $29
million for leasehold acquisition, $14 million for seismic and $29 million in
capitalized costs and other expenses.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2009, we plan to invest approximately $1.3 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which includes participating in approximately 650
horizontal wells, 500 of which will be operated by us. At December 31, 2008, we
had acquired approximately 961 square miles of 3-D seismic data and plan to
acquire approximately 139 square miles of 3-D seismic data during 2009, the
total of which will give us seismic data on approximately 41% of our net acreage
position in the Fayetteville Shale, excluding our acreage in the traditional
Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We believe that our Fayetteville Shale acreage holds significant
development potential. Our strategy going forward is to increase our production
through development drilling as well as increase the amount of acreage we hold
by production while determining the economic viability of the undrilled portion
of our acreage.  Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville
Shale play is flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including
the results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the
most effective and economic fracture stimulation methods and well spacing, the
extent to which we can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville
Shale wells in other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas commodity
price environment.  As we continue to gather data about the Fayetteville

 Production over the last few years from the basin has risen as new
production stemming from our drilling program has more than offset the natural
production decline from existing wells.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our strategy in the Arkoma Basin is to identify trends using our
extensive expertise in the area.  In recent years, we have extended our
development program into other areas of the basin that had previously been less
explored, primarily the Ranger Anticline area and the Midway area, which was our
primary focus in 2008.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We began drilling at our Midway prospect area located
approximately 11 miles north of Ranger in 2005 and, through year-end 2008, we
had drilled a total of 59 wells.  Our wells at Midway have primarily
targeted the Basham and Borum tight gas sands between 3,500 and 6,000 feet in
depth, and net production from the area was 2.7 Bcf in 2008, compared to 0.8 Bcf
in 2007 and 0.1 Bcf in 2006.  At year-end 2008, we held approximately
31,000 gross acres in our Midway prospect area.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Ranger Anticline is located at the southern edge of the
Arkansas portion of the basin.  From 1997 through year-end 2008, we had
successfully drilled 215 wells at Ranger.

 Net production from the field was 9.5 Bcf in
2008, compared to 9.5 Bcf in 2007 and 5.7 Bcf in 2006.  At December 31,
2008, we held approximately 96,640 gross acres at Ranger, of which 24,320 acres
were developed.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In 2009, we plan to invest approximately $60 million in our
conventional Arkoma program and will drill approximately 25 wells.

align=justify>East Texas.  Our East Texas operations are primarily
located in the Overton Field in Smith County, Texas, and our Angelina River
Trend area located in Angelina, Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Shelby Counties
in Texas.  At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 351 Bcfe of reserves
in East Texas, compared to 353 Bcfe at year-end 2007 and 383 Bcfe at year-end
2006.  In 2008, we invested approximately $160 million in East Texas and
participated in 50 wells, of which 42 were successful and 8 were in progress at
year-end, resulting in a 100% success rate and adding new reserves of 53 Bcfe.
This area recorded net downward revisions of approximately 23 Bcfe primarily due
to a comparative decrease in year-end gas prices and negative performance
revisions. Net production from East Texas was 31.6 Bcfe in 2008, compared to
29.9 Bcfe in 2007 and 32.0 Bcfe in 2006.  Production during 2008 grew
primarily due to our successful drilling program in the James Lime formation in
the Angelina River Trend area which more than offset the natural production
decline in our Overton Field.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our original interest in the Overton Field (which was
approximately 10,800 gross acres) was acquired in April 2000 for $6 million.
 Our wells in the Overton Field produce from four Taylor series sands in
the Cotton Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet.  At December 31,
2008, we held approximately 24,400 gross acres in the Overton Field with an
average working interest of 85% and an average net revenue interest of 68%.
 Our proved reserves in the Overton Field were 273 Bcfe at year-end 2008,
compared to 315 Bcfe at year-end 2007 and 367 Bcfe at year-end 2006.  In
2008, we invested approximately $16 million to drill nine wells at the Overton
Field, all of which were successful.  Net production from our Overton Field
was 19.9 Bcfe in 2008, compared to 25.1 Bcfe in 2007 and 29.8 Bcfe in 2006. We
expect our production from the Overton field to continue to decline in 2009 due
to the continued lack of significant investment in the further development of
the field and the natural production decline in existing wells.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our Angelina River Trend properties, collectively referred to as
Angelina, are concentrated in several separate development areas located
primarily in four counties in East Texas targeting the Travis Peak, Pettet and
James Lime formations. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately 86,400 gross
undeveloped acres and 16,700 gross developed acres at Angelina with an average
working interest of 67% and an average net revenue interest of 52%.  In
2008, we invested approximately $112 million to drill 41 wells at Angelina, all
of which were successful or in progress at December 31, 2008.  Our 2008
drilling program was primarily focused on developing the James Lime formation in
our Jebel prospect area located in Shelby County, Texas.  During 2008, we
participated in 32 James Lime horizontal wells (20 of which we operated) and
placed 15 wells that we operated on production at an average gross initial
production rate of 9.1 MMcfe per day.  Our proved reserves in the Angelina
area were 74 Bcfe at year-end 2008, compared to 33 Bcfe at year-end 2007 and 16
Bcfe at year-end 2006.  Net production from our Angelina properties was
11.3 Bcfe in 2008, compared to 2.5 Bcfe in 2007 and 1.8 Bcfe in 2006.

align=justify>We actively seek to find and develop new oil and gas plays with
significant exploration and exploitation potential, which we refer to as “New
Ventures.” We have been focusing on unconventional plays (including coalbed
methane, shale gas and basin-centered gas) as well as determining the
technological methods best suited to developing these plays, such as horizontal
drilling and fracture stimulation techniques. New Ventures prospects are
evaluated based on repeatability, multi-well potential and land availability as
well as other criteria and may be located both inside and outside of the United
States.  At December 31, 2008, we held 138,638 net undeveloped acres in the
United States outside of our core operating areas in connection with New
Ventures prospects.  This compares to 156,465 net undeveloped acres held at

play in Pennsylvania.  At year-end 2008, we had approximately 114,738 net
acres in Pennsylvania under which we believe the Marcellus Shale is prospective
at a total cost of $530 per acre.  During 2008, we drilled our first four
wells (three vertical and one horizontal) on our acreage in Bradford and
Susquehanna Counties, three of which have been production tested.  In the
first quarter of 2009, we purchased approximately 21,715 net acres in Lycoming

play.  We also invested approximately $10.5 million in 2007 to spud 25
wells in our Riverton coalbed methane project in Caldwell Parish, Louisiana, of
which all were successful.  We have approximately 35,200 net acres in this
project area targeting the Tertiary-age lower Wilcox coals at a depth of
approximately 2,800 feet.  Additionally in 2007, we invested $5.2 million
to participate in 5 outside-operated Woodford Shale wells in Oklahoma.  In
2006, we invested approximately $46 million as part of our New Ventures program
to purchase acreage and drill 7 exploration wells, of which 5 were successful.

11 were dry and 260 were in progress at year-end.  Of the 260 wells in
progress at year-end, 236 were located in our Fayetteville Shale play.  Our
investments focused primarily on our active drilling programs in the
Fayetteville Shale play, East Texas and the conventional Arkoma Basin, which
accounted for 76%, 10% and 8% of our E&P capital investments in 2008,
respectively.  We invested approximately $1.2 billion in our Fayetteville
Shale play, $160 million in East Texas, $133 million in our conventional Arkoma

 Additionally, we invested approximately $36 million in drilling rig
related and ancillary equipment.  In 2007, we invested approximately $1.4
billion in our primary E&P business activities and participated in drilling
653 wells.  Of the $1.4 billion invested in 2007, approximately $1.1
billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $66

million for producing property acquisitions and $77 million in capitalized
interest and expenses and other technology-related expenditures.  In 2006,
we invested approximately $767 million in our primary E&P business
activities and participated in drilling 382 wells. Additionally, we invested $94
million for the purchase of drilling rigs and related equipment which were sold
in December 2006 as part of a sale and leaseback transaction. Of the $767
million invested in 2006, approximately $196 million was invested in exploratory

 SEECO’s sales to AWG were 4.3 Bcf in 2008, compared to 4.8 Bcf in 2007 and
4.7 Bcf in 2006.  In connection with the sale of AWG to SourceGas effective
on July 1, 2008, SEECO signed a five-year natural gas services agreement with
AWG pursuant to which AWG, among other things, will transport SEECO’s production
on its gathering system to industrial and commercial end-users on AWG’s system.
 SEECO’s sales to AWG are dependant upon its ability to successfully bid
for AWG gas supply contracts in a competitive bidding process.  SEECO also
owns an unregulated natural gas storage facility connected to AWG’s distribution
system that has historically been utilized to help meet its peak seasonal sales
commitments and has in the past provided a competitive advantage in the bidding
process.  Future sales to AWG will be dependent upon SEECO’s success in
obtaining gas supply contracts from them.  Sales to
AWG accounted for approximately 2% of total E&P revenues in 2008, 4% in 2007

arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude
oil production in order to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to
minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit
speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with
appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2008, we had hedges in place on
135 Bcf, or approximately 48% of our targeted 2009 gas production, and 50 Bcf of
our expected 2010 gas production. We intend to hedge additional future
production volumes in the event that natural gas prices rise to levels that

natural gas production in 2008, compared to $6.80 per Mcf in 2007 and $6.55 per
Mcf in 2006, including the effect of hedges.  Our hedging activities
decreased our average gas price $0.21 per Mcf in 2008 and increased our average
price $0.64 per Mcf in 2007 and $0.18 per Mcf in 2006.  Our average oil

align=justify>Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for
our gas production has historically been approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf
lower than average NYMEX spot market prices. However, during 2008, 2007 and
2006, widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price
received for our gas production to be approximately $0.70 to $1.30 per Mcf lower
than spot market prices.  The discount was at its widest point in late 2008
due to the impact that the delay in the completion of Boardwalk Pipeline had
upon the Centerpoint East differential. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of
$6.00 per Mcf of gas for 2009, the average price received for our gas production
is expected to be approximately $0.75 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index
price, including the impact of our basis hedges.  
Impact of
Federal Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas and Oil
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has
been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC.  In 1989, Congress
enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act.  The
Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting
wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers
of natural gas can be made at uncontrolled market prices.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated
and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and
judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the
natural gas industry.  There can be no assurance that the less stringent
regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. <A

pipeline transportation in Arkansas should increase our access to markets for
our gas production, these markets will also be served by a number of other
suppliers.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect
both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. Outside Arkansas, we
are less established and face competition from a larger number of other
producers.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Commencing in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders
(collectively, “Order No. 636”), which require interstate pipelines to provide
transportation separately, or “unbundled,” from the pipelines’ sales of gas.
 Order No. 636 also requires pipelines to provide open-access
transportation on a basis that is equal for all shippers.  Although Order
No. 636 does not directly regulate our activities, the FERC has stated that it
intends for Order No. 636 to foster increased competition within all phases of
the natural gas industry.  Starting in 2000, the FERC issued a series of
orders (collectively, “Order No. 637”), which imposed a number of additional
reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  Among
other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period, and effected
changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity
segmentation, pipeline penalties, rights of first refusal and information
reporting.  The implementation of these orders has not had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations to date. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms
initiated by the FERC or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of
increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing
transparency in markets in which our natural gas is sold.  However, we do
not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other
natural gas producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other
legislative body. 
Midstream
Services
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our Midstream Services segment is well-positioned to complement
our E&P initiatives and to compete with other midstream providers for
unaffiliated business. Our midstream assets support our E&P operations and
are currently concentrated in our Fayetteville Shale play. We generate revenue
from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market
and through the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party natural
gas.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our operating income from this segment was $62.3 million on
revenues of $2.2 billion in 2008, compared to $13.2 million on revenues of
$962.0 million in 2007 and $4.1 million on revenues of $475.2 million in 2006.
The increases in revenues are largely attributable to increased gathering
revenues, increased volumes marketed and higher purchased gas costs.  <A
name=_DV_M435>EBITDA generated by our midstream services segment was $73.9
million in 2008, compared to $18.8 million in 2007 and $5.3 million in 2006.
 The increase in 2008 and 2007 operating income and EBITDA was primarily
due to increased gathering revenues and marketing margins, partially offset by
increased operating costs and expenses.  We expect that the operating
income and EBITDA of our Midstream Services segment will increase significantly
over the next few years as we continue to develop our Fayetteville Shale
acreage.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to “Business —
Other Items — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 1 of Part I of this
Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income.
 
Gas
Gathering
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We engage in gas gathering activities through our gathering
subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company, L.L.C. and Angelina Gathering Company,
L.L.C., which we refer to as DGC and AGC, respectively. DGC engages in gathering
activities in Arkansas primarily related to the development of our Fayetteville
Shale play.  In 2008, we invested 

13

<A

approximately $183.0 million related to these activities
and had gathering revenues of $114.9 million, compared to $107.4 million
invested and revenues of $37.7 million in 2007 and $48.7 million invested and
$7.9 million in revenues in 2006.  DGC is rapidly expanding its network of
gathering pipelines and facilities throughout the Fayetteville Shale region.
During 2008, DGC gathered approximately 208.3 Bcf of gas volumes in the
Fayetteville Shale play area, including 23.8 Bcf of third-party natural gas. In
2007, DGC gathered approximately 78.7 Bcf of gas volumes in the Fayetteville
Shale play area, including 7.6 Bcf of third-party natural gas. In 2006, DGC
gathered approximately 14.6 Bcf of gas. The increase in volumes gathered in 2008
and 2007 was primarily due to our growing production volumes from the
Fayetteville Shale play. At the end of 2008, DGC had approximately 843 miles of
pipe from the individual wellheads to the transmission lines and compression
equipment had been installed at 37 central point gathering facilities in the
field. AGC currently engages in gathering activities in East Texas in connection
with our Angelina properties. AGC provides gathering support for all of our
E&P operations outside of Arkansas. At year-end 2008, AGC had approximately
9 miles of pipeline in Texas. Our gathering revenues are expected to grow
substantially over the next few years largely as a result of increased
development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and the increased
development activity undertaken by other operators in the play area.
 
Gas
Marketing
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our gas marketing subsidiary, SES, allows us to capture downstream
opportunities which arise through marketing and transportation activity. SES not
only purchases, sells and schedules natural gas to be delivered to certain
end-users, but also is involved in basis management, marketing portfolio
management and acquiring transportation rights on pipelines.  Our current
marketing operations primarily relate to the marketing of our own gas production
and some third-party natural gas.  During 2008, we marketed 258.0 Bcf of
natural gas, compared to 145.7 Bcf in 2007 and 72.7 Bcf in 2006.  Purchases
from our E&P subsidiaries accounted for 96% of total volumes marketed in
2008, compared to 89% in 2007 and 85% in 2006.
On December 15, 2006,
due to the significant growth of future production volumes from our operations
in the Fayetteville Shale play, SES signed a precedent agreement with Texas Gas
Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP,
for the construction of two pipeline laterals to serve the Fayetteville Shale
play. Pursuant to the precedent agreement with Texas Gas, in the third quarter
of 2008, SES entered into firm transportation agreements with Texas Gas relating
to its commitments for the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals. SES’ options to
increase the volumes to be transported on each of the laterals were fully
exercised in 2008 and SES has maximum aggregate commitments of 800,000 MMBtu per
day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville
Lateral.

During 2008, the
majority of our gas from the Arkoma Basin was moved to markets in the Midwest
and was sold primarily based on two indices, “NGPL TexOk” and “Centerpoint
East.”   On December 24, 2008, the Phase 1 facilities of the
Fayetteville Lateral portion of the Texas Gas Pipeline began transporting gas to
markets.  We expect the Phase 2 facilities, which include the Greenville
Lateral that originates at the Texas Gas mainline system near Greenville,
Mississippi, and extends eastward to interconnect with various interstate
pipelines, to be placed in-service during the second quarter of 2009.  When
the Phase 2 facilities of the Texas Gas Pipeline are placed in-service, our
transportation agreements will give us access to additional markets east of the
Mississippi river which could result in increasing our average wellhead price.
 The Fayetteville and Greenville laterals will transport our gas to markets
in the eastern United States and will interconnect with Texas Gas Zone 1,
Tennessee Gas Pipeline 100, Trunkline Zone 1A, ANR, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 800,
Columbia Gulf Mainline, TETCO M1 30" and Sonat.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>On September 30, 2008, again due to anticipated significant growth
of future production volumes from our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play,
SES entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which it will contract for
firm gas transportation services on a proposed new pipeline of Fayetteville
Express Pipeline LLC, which is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners,
L.P. and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.  SES will be a “Foundation Shipper”
for the project and will use the new pipeline primarily to deliver gas volumes
produced from our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play to eastern markets.
 Pending regulatory approvals, the pipeline is expected to be in-service by
late 2010 or early 2011.  The proposed pipeline will have an estimated
ultimate capacity of up to 2.0 Bcf per day.  Following the approval of the
pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and subject to
certain conditions, pursuant to the precedent agreement, SES will enter into a
firm transportation agreement to transport up to 1,200,000 Dekatherms per day
for an initial term of ten years.

align=justify>Competition
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies
offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other
resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are affiliates of
companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from
producers to end-users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and
availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of
and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities.  We believe
that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the
future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with
producers and end-users. We also experience competition for our gathering
services from other producers and non-affiliated gathering companies and we
expect this competition to continue in the future.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px"
align=justify>Regulation
On March 15, 2006, the
Department of Transportation, or the DOT, issued new rules pertaining to certain
gathering lines. Compliance with the new rules has not had a material adverse
impact on our operations. We refer you to “Other Items — Environmental Matters”
and the risk factor “We incur substantial costs to comply with government
regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and
could incur even greater costs in the future” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form
10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on our Midstream
Services business.

On November 20, 2008,
the FERC issued a Final Rule in Order No. 720, which requires, in relevant part,
major non-interstate natural gas pipelines to post, on a daily basis, specific
scheduled flow information at each receipt or delivery point with a design
capacity of 15,000 MMBtu per day or more. A “major non-interstate pipeline” is a
pipeline that is not classified as a natural gas company under the National Gas
Act and delivers on average more than 50 million MMBtu of gas annually over a
three year period.  Our gathering system constitutes a “major
non-interstate pipeline” under Order No. 720 and will be required to comply with
the requirements of Order No. 720 once they become effective for major
non-interstate pipelines.  On December 11, 2008, the American Gas
Association filed a Motion for an Extension of Time to Comply with Order No. 720
arguing that some major non-interstate pipelines will need additional time in
which to determine which receipt and delivery points are subject to the posting
requirements, obtain corporate approval for expenditures needed for compliance
and develop internet posting systems. On January 15, 2009, FERC granted an
extension of time for major non-interstate pipelines to comply with the
requirements of Order No. 720 until 150 days following the issuance of an order
addressing the pending requests for rehearing.

Natural Gas
Distribution
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Effective July 1, 2008, we sold all of the capital stock of
Arkansas Western Gas Company (“AWG”) to SourceGas, L.L.C. for $223.5 million
(net of expenses related to the sale). In order to receive regulatory approval
for the sale and certain related transactions, we paid $9.8 million to AWG for
the benefit of its customers.  We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of
$57.3 million in the third quarter of 2008.  As a result of the sale of the
utility, we are no longer engaged in natural gas distribution operations.
AWG provided operating
income for the first half of 2008 of $10.7 million, compared to $10.0 million
for the entire year of 2007 and $4.5 million for the entire year of 2006.

Transportation
and Other
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>On May 2, 2006, we sold our 25% interest in NOARK Pipeline
System, Limited Partnership (NOARK), a partnership that owns a 723-mile
integrated interstate pipeline system known as Ozark Gas Transmission System, to
Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax
gain of $10.9 million. In connection with the sale, we assumed
$39.0 million of partnership debt that we had previously guaranteed. Our
share of NOARK’s results of operations was a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million
in 2006 prior to the sale.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our other operations have primarily consisted of the activities of
our wholly-owned subsidiary, A. W. Realty Company, a company with real estate
development activities concentrated on tracts of land located in Arkansas.
 There were no sales of commercial real estate in 2008, 2007 or 2006. As of
December 31, 2008, A. W. Realty Company owned our office complex in
Fayetteville, Arkansas, an interest in approximately 15 acres of undeveloped
real estate near the Fayetteville complex and 457 acres in or near Conway,
Arkansas, related to our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.

laws and regulations including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air
Act and similar state statutes.  These laws and regulations require permits
for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill
or operate wells and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method
of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon
which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, the prevention
and cleanup of pollutants and other matters.  We maintain insurance against
costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such
risks.  Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have
a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there
can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent
environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material
environmental liabilities or costs.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result
in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties
and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Changes in environmental
laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more
stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal
or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations
and financial position, as well as those in the natural gas and oil
industry in general.  Although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and

will continue in the future.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations
thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties”
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting
from such spills in United States’ waters.  A “responsible party”
includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel,
or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is
located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil
cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  While
liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage
of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful
misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or
operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate
fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses
exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on
a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans
and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and
restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a
“hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and
companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal
of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were
responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to
joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to
natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or the
RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and
production of natural gas and oil.  The RCRA specifically excludes from the
definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural
gas or geothermal energy.”  However, legislation has been proposed in
Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil
exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the
reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and
clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a
significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and
oil industry in general.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as
paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated
as hazardous waste. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased,
onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated
with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  Although
we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the
industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed
of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under
other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In
addition, a portion of these properties have been operated by third parties
whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our
control.  These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be
subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and analogous state laws.
 Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate
previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by
prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater
contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial
plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.   
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA,
imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of
produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters.
 Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to
conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and
similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties
for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges
of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state
discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System general permits issued by the Environmental Protection
Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand,
drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the
natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters.  Although the costs
to comply with zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be
significant, the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs
and we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations or financial position.  The EPA has
adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and
production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs
may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and
implementing storm water pollution prevention plans.

align=justify>We utilize hydraulic fracturing in connection with certain of our
E&P operations.  In hydraulic fracturing, large quantities of water,
sand, and certain additives are injected under high pressure into the target
formation.  As the mixture is forced into the formation, the pressure
causes the rock to fracture and the sand remains behind to prop open the
fractures.  These fractures create a pathway for the gas to flow out of the
formation and into the wellbore.  A 2004 study conducted by the EPA found
that hydraulic fracturing posed no risk to drinking water and Congress exempted
hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act. Recently, there has been
a heightened debate over whether the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing may
contaminate drinking-water supply and proposals have been made to revisit the
environmental exemption for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water
Act or to enact legislation at the state and local government levels that would
regulate the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water supply.  If
the exemption for hydraulic fracturing is removed from the Safe Drinking Water
Act, or if legislation is enacted at the state and local level, it could have a
significant impact on the natural gas industry as a whole and on our financial
condition and results of operation.

of locational differentials for our production from the Arkoma Basin and East
Texas which may widen due to pipeline or other constraints. Price volatility
makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and
development projects involving our natural gas and oil properties and to
estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or
propose to acquire.  In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt
the market for natural gas and oil properties, as buyers and sellers have more
difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.  Our results of
operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things,
variations in natural gas and oil prices and production performance.  In
recent years, natural gas and oil price volatility has become increasingly
severe.

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We use the full cost method of accounting for our natural gas and
oil operations.  Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore
for and develop natural gas and oil properties.  Under the full cost
accounting rules of the SEC, the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil
properties – net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
deferred income taxes – may not exceed a “ceiling limit.”  This is equal to
the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and
oil reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of
unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax
effects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>These rules generally require pricing future natural gas and oil
production at the unescalated natural gas and oil prices in effect at the end of
each fiscal quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges.
 They also require a write-down if the ceiling limit is exceeded, even if
prices declined for only a relatively short period of time.  Once a
write-down is taken, it cannot be reversed in future periods even if natural gas
and oil prices increase. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>If natural gas and oil prices decline below levels at December 31,

Although our
estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our
estimates may still prove to be inaccurate.
Our reserve data
represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision
of our management.  Our reserve estimates are audited each year by
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSA, an independent petroleum
engineering firm.  In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of
NSA study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve
estimates.  NSA’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which
includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately
83% of the present worth of our total proved reserves.  NSA’s audit process
consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting
the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields
account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The
properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are the lowest value
properties and are not reviewed in the audit.  The fields included in
approximately the top 83% present value as of December 31, 2008 accounted for
approximately 83% of our total proved reserves and approximately 92% of our
proved undeveloped reserves.  In the conduct of its audit, NSA did not
independently verify the data that we provided to them with respect to ownership
interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of
operations and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to
current and future operations of the properties and sales of production.
 NSA has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to
its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such
information or data, NSA did not rely on such information or data until it had
satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently
verified such information or data. The estimates of Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. may differ significantly on an individual property basis from
our estimates. When, in the aggregate, such differences are within 10%,
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. is generally satisfied that the
estimates of proved reserves are reasonable.  

Reserve estimates are
prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned
to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property
is located.  These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not
part of the asset management teams and by our President and Chief Operating
Officer.  Finally, the estimates of our proved reserves together with the
audit report of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. are reviewed by our
Board of Directors.  There are numerous uncertainties and risks that are
inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting
future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many
factors are beyond our control.  We incorporate many factors and
assumptions into our estimates including:

Although we believe our
assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time
we prepare our estimates, our actual results could vary considerably from
estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves (in the aggregate
and for a particular geographic location), production, revenues, taxes and
development and operating expenditures.  In addition, our estimates of
reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production
history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing natural gas
and oil prices, severance taxes, operating and development costs and other
factors.  In 2008, our reserves were revised upward by 98.1 Bcfe, primarily
due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties, partially
offset by downward revisions due to lower year-end oil and gas prices combined
with the performance revisions in some of our East Texas and conventional Arkoma
Basin properties. In 2007, our reserves were revised upward by 31.0 Bcfe,
primarily due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties,
which was partially offset by a downward revision in our Overton properties.
 In 2006, our reserves were revised downward by 86.6 Bcfe, primarily due to
lower prevailing oil and gas prices at year-end combined with performance
revisions in some of our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin properties,
which were partially

offset by an upward performance revision in
our Fayetteville Shale properties.  These revisions represented no greater
than 8% of our total reserve estimates in each of these years, which we believe
is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.  Because we
review our reserve projections for every property at the end of every year, any
material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent reserve
reports.

discussed above under “Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale play are
subject to change,” our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors,
including certain factors that are beyond our control.  The number of wells
we will be required to drill to retain our leasehold rights will be determined
by field rules established by the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, or the AOGC.

the Moorefield Shale and the Chattanooga Shale as “unconventional sources of
supply.”  Under the rules, each drilling unit would consist of a
governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators would be permitted
to drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of
supply.  However, current rules are subject to change and could impair our
ability to drill or

maintain our
acreage position.  To the extent that any field rules prevent us from
successfully drilling wells in certain areas, we may not be able to drill the
wells required to maintain our leasehold rights for certain of our Fayetteville
Shale acreage.
If our
Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a significant supply of
natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost and
our commitments for transportation on pipelines could make the sale of our gas
uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>As of December 31, 2008, we had invested approximately $342.3
million in our gas gathering operations and we intend to invest approximately
$220 million in 2009.  Our gas gathering business will largely rely on gas
sourced in our Fayetteville Shale play area in Arkansas.  In addition, we
have signed 10-year firm transportation agreements committing us to
transportation on the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals being built by Texas
Gas Transmission, LLC, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, or Texas
Gas, to service the Fayetteville Shale play area. We have also entered into a
precedent agreement with Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, which is jointly
owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.,
with respect to another pipeline for the Fayetteville Shale play, pursuant to
which we will have significant firm transportation commitments if the pipeline
is built. Our marketing subsidiary has also entered into multiple other firm
transportation agreements relating to gas volumes from our Fayetteville Shale
play.  If our Fayetteville Shale drilling program fails to produce a
significant supply of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering
operations could be lost, and we could be forced to pay transportation fees on
pipeline capacity that we would not be using.  These events could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.
Our
exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may
not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage in
order to further our development efforts.  Exploration, development,
drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk
that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered.  We invest
in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result
in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot assure you that
all prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our
initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that leasehold
acreage acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by
us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or
any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells.  Drilling
for natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry
wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net
reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.
 In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate
of return.  Our ability to achieve our target PVI results are dependent
upon the current and future market prices for natural gas and crude oil, costs
associated with producing natural gas and crude oil and our ability to add
reserves at an acceptable cost.  We rely to a significant extent on seismic
data and other advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects
and in conducting our exploration activities.  The seismic data and other
technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of
leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether natural gas or oil is present or
may be produced economically.  The use of seismic data and other
technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional
drilling strategies.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>In addition, we may not be successful in implementing our business
strategy of controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order
to improve our overall return.  The cost of drilling, completing and
operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the
economics of a project.  Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed,
delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including unexpected
drilling conditions, title problems, pressure or irregularities in formations,
equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, environmental and
other governmental requirements and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.
We incur
substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations
relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the
future.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our exploration, production, development and gas distribution and
marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local
levels.  We have made and will continue to make large expenditures in our
efforts to comply with these regulations, including environmental regulation.
The natural gas and oil regulatory environment could change in ways that might
substantially increase these costs.  Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate
conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights.  These
regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons we may
produce and sell.  In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission regulates interstate transportation of natural gas
under the Natural Gas Act.  Other regulated matters include marketing,
pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments.

properties, and an owner of gas gathering systems, we are subject to various
federal, state and local regulations relating to discharge of materials into,
and protection of, the environment.  These regulations may, among other
things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from
operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require
suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Changes in or
additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could
significantly increase our costs of compliance, or otherwise adversely affect
our business.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>One of the responsibilities of owning and operating natural gas
and oil properties is paying for the cost of abandonment. Effective January 1,
2003, companies were required to reflect abandonment costs as a liability on
their balance sheets. We may incur significant abandonment costs in the future
which could adversely affect our financial results. 
Natural gas and
oil drilling and producing operations involve various risks.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to
the operation and development of natural gas and oil properties, the drilling of
natural gas and oil wells and the sale of natural gas and oil, including but not
limited to encountering well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure,
fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural
gas, brine or well fluids, hydrocarbon drainage from adjacent third-party
production, release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental
hazards and risks and failure of counterparties to perform as agreed.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities
arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and
in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  However, our insurance does not
protect us against all operational risks.  For example, we do not maintain
business interruption insurance.  Additionally, pollution and environmental
risks generally are not fully insurable.  These risks could give rise to
significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a material adverse
effect upon our financial results.  
We cannot
control activities on properties we do not operate.  Failure to fund
capital investments may result in reduction or forfeiture of our interests in
some of our non-operated projects.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We do not operate some of the properties in which we have an
interest and we have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for
these properties or their associated costs.  As of December 31, 2008,
approximately 5% of our gas and oil properties, based on PV-10 value, were
operated by other companies.  Our dependence on the operator and other
working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence
operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the
realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition
activities and our targeted production growth rate.  The success and timing
of drilling, development and exploitation activities on properties operated by
others depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the
operator's expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants for
drilling wells and utilization of technology.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>When we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular
natural gas or oil project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of
capital investments associated with such project.  If we are not willing or
able to fund our capital investments relating to such projects when required by
the majority owner or operator, our interests in these projects may be reduced
or forfeited.
Our ability to
sell our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially harmed if we
fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. 
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>Our ability to bring natural gas and crude oil production to
market depends on a number of factors including the availability and proximity
of pipelines, gathering systems and processing facilities. In some of the areas
where we have operations, we deliver natural gas and crude oil through gathering
systems and pipelines that we do not own.  With respect to our Fayetteville
Shale production, we are relying on third parties to construct additional
interstate pipelines to increase our ability to bring our production to market.
The Fayetteville and Greenville laterals being built by Texas Gas were supposed
to be fully available in January 2009 but are experiencing delays. Delays in the
commencement of operations of the new pipelines, the unavailability of the new
pipelines or other facilities due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or
otherwise could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial condition.  Any significant change affecting these facilities or
our failure to obtain access to existing or future facilities on acceptable
terms could restrict our ability to conduct normal operations.

wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and

significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing
periodic shortages. For example, during the last half of 2006, we had difficulty
obtaining additional well completion services due to a shortage of completion
crews in our Fayetteville Shale play area, which resulted in a higher inventory
of wells that had been drilled but were awaiting completion.  There have
also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and
equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
 These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment,
services and personnel.  Higher natural gas and oil prices generally
stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs,
crews and associated supplies, equipment and services.  In addition, our
E&P operations also require local access to large quantities of water
supplies and disposal services for produced water in connection with our
hydraulic fracture stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs. We
cannot be certain when we will experience shortages or price increases, which
could adversely affect our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or
restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations. 
Our business
could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our
business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better
competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we
frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses,
concessions, marketing agreements, equipment and labor against companies with
financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess.  Many
of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and
productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.
 Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire
additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct
operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in this highly competitive environment.  In addition, many of
our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer
time than we have or have established strategic long-term positions in
geographic regions in which we may seek new entry.
We have made
significant investments in our drilling rig operations and we have significant
commitments with third-party drilling companies.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We have made significant investments in our drilling rig
operations, including lease commitments for 14 drilling rigs and related
equipment and have hired, as of December 31, 2008, 371 employees for our
drilling subsidiary, DeSoto Drilling, Inc. We also own one drilling rig. In
addition to the rigs we are leasing, we have contracts for third-party drilling
companies for use of their rigs which may not be terminable without penalty.
 Our drilling rig operations may have an adverse effect on our
relationships with our existing third-party rig providers or our ability to
secure third-party rigs from other providers.  We may also compete with
third-party rig providers for qualified personnel, which could adversely affect
our relationships with rig providers. If our existing third-party rig providers
discontinue their relationships with us, we may not be able to secure
alternative rigs on a timely basis, or at all.  Even if we are able to
secure alternative rigs, there can be no assurance that replacement rigs will be
of equivalent quality or that pricing and other terms will be favorable to us.
 If we are unable to secure third-party rigs or if the terms are not
favorable to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
We have limited
experience in operating drilling rigs.
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract
and retain qualified field personnel to operate our drilling rigs or to
otherwise effectively conduct our drilling operations.  If we are unable to
retain qualified personnel or to effectively conduct our drilling operations,
our financial and operating results may be adversely affected.
We depend upon
our management team and our operations require us to attract and retain
experienced technical personnel.  
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 13px; TEXT-INDENT: 48px"
align=justify>The successful implementation of our business strategy and
handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy
depends, in part, on our experienced management team, as well as certain key
geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals employed by us.
 The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified
technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results.

align=justify>To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural
gas and oil, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our
expected production.  As of December 31, 2008, we had hedges on
approximately 48% of our targeted 2009 natural gas production.  Our price
risk management activities decreased revenues by $40.5 million in 2008, and
increased revenues by $70.7 million in 2007 and $8.7 million in 2006.  To
the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from
realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges.

Our stockholder rights
plan, together with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, could discourage an effort to acquire us, gain control of the company,
or replace members of our executive management team. These provisions could
potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our
common stock at above-market prices.
