    The Company’s results for 2010 reflected strong spending
    growth and improved credit performance. Throughout the year
    cardmember spending volumes grew both in the United States and
    internationally, and across all of the Company’s
    businesses. Cardmember spending levels in 2010 reached record
    levels at the end of the year. Improving credit trends
    contributed to the reduction in loan and receivable write-offs
    and the reduction of loss reserve levels over the course of 2010
    when compared to 2009. It is expected that the
    year-over-year
    benefits from improving credit trends will decrease over the
    course of 2011. While the Company invested at historically high
    levels in 2010, it intends to maintain the flexibility to scale
    back on investments as business conditions change and the
    benefits realized from improving credit trends lessen.


 


    Despite improvement in parts of the economic environment,
    challenges clearly remain for the Company, both in the United
    States and in many other key regions. These challenges include
    weak job creation, volatile consumer confidence, consumer
    behavior, an uncertain housing market, and the regulatory and
    legislative environment, including the uncertain impact of the
    Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of
    2009 (the “CARD Act”), of the recently enacted
    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (“Dodd-Frank”) and of the proceeding against the
    Company recently brought by the Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) and certain state attorneys general alleging a
    violation of the U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, as
    previously discussed, the Company will stop receiving quarterly
    litigation payments from MasterCard International, Inc.
    (“MasterCard”) and Visa Inc. (“Visa”) at the
    end of the second and fourth quarters of 2011, respectively, and
    year-over-year
    comparisons will be more difficult to maintain in light of the
    strong 2010 results.


 


    In 2011, the Company will be particularly focused on several
    initiatives designed to help us accomplish our long-term growth
    goals: providing greater value to merchants; adding more women,
    minorities and younger adults to our customer base; accelerating
    our growth outside the U.S.; making significant progress in the
    Enterprise Growth Group; and increasing our share of online
    spending across all products while transforming our
    customers’ digital experience.


 


    We also continue to seek more ways to turn existing capabilities
    and relationships into new fee services. In the past eighteen
    months, we launched or expanded several key initiatives,
    including Business Insights, which provides analytics and
    consulting services to help merchants attract more customers and
    increase sales, and AcceptPay, which simplifies the invoicing
    and payment process for small businesses. Overall, we set an
    aggressive goal to generate $3 billion in annual fee-based
    revenues for the Company by the end of 2014.

    The Company’s products and services are sold globally to
    diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses,
    mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and
    services are sold through various channels, including direct
    mail, on-line applications, targeted direct and third-party
    sales forces, and direct response advertising.


 


    The Company’s products and services generate the following
    types of revenue for the Company:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Discount revenue, the Company’s largest revenue source,
    which represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use
    their cards to purchase goods and services on the Company’s
    network;




 



     
        • 

    
    Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual charge
    card memberships;




 



     
        • 

    
    Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a
    transaction or management fee for airline or other
    travel-related transactions;




 



     
        • 

    
    Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange
    conversions and card-related fees and assessments;




 



     
        • 

    
    Other revenue, which represents insurance premiums earned from
    cardmember travel and other insurance programs, revenues arising
    from contracts with Global Network Services’ partners
    (including royalties and signing fees), publishing revenues and
    other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and




 



     
        • 

    
    Interest and fees on loans, which principally represents
    interest income earned on outstanding balances, and card fees
    related to the cardmember loans portfolio.





 


    Our general-purpose card network, card-issuing and
    merchant-acquiring and processing businesses are global in
    scope. We are a world leader in providing charge and credit
    cards to consumers, small businesses and corporations. These
    cards include cards issued by American Express as well as cards
    issued by third-party banks and other institutions that are
    accepted on the American Express network (collectively,
    “Cards”). Our Cards permit our cardmembers
    (“Cardmembers”) to charge purchases of goods and
    services in most countries around the world at the millions of
    merchants that accept Cards bearing our logo. At
    December 31, 2010, we had total worldwide
    Cards-in-force
    of 91.0 million (including Cards issued by third parties).
    In 2010, our worldwide billed business (spending on American
    Express®

    Cards, including Cards issued by third parties) was
    $713 billion.


 


    The Company has also recently created an Enterprise Growth Group
    to focus on generating alternative sources of revenue on a
    global basis, both organically and through acquisitions, in
    areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services.
    For a discussion concerning our Enterprise Growth Group, please
    see “Corporate & Other” below.


 


    Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal
    fluctuations, although travel sales generally tend to be highest
    in the second and fourth quarters. Travelers Cheque sales and
    Travelers Cheques outstanding tend to be greatest each year in
    the summer months, peaking in the third quarter. American
    Express®

    Gift Card sales are highest in the months of November and
    December; and Card billed business tends to be moderately higher
    in the fourth quarter than in other quarters.


 



    Spend-Centric
    Model is Competitive Advantage


 


    Despite the continuing challenges of the current economic
    environment, we believe our “spend-centric” business
    model (which focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving
    spending on our Cards and secondarily by finance charges and
    fees) continues to give us significant competitive advantages.
    Average spending on our Cards, which is substantially higher on
    a per-card basis for us versus our competitors, represents
    greater value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and
    higher sales. This enables us to earn premium discount rates and
    thereby invest in greater value-added services for merchants and
    Cardmembers. As a result of the higher revenues generated from
    higher spending Cardmembers, we have the flexibility to invest
    in more attractive rewards and other incentives to Cardmembers,
    and targeted marketing and other





    
    3



Table of Contents





    programs and investments for merchants, all of which in turn
    create incentives for Cardmembers to spend more on their Cards.
    The significant investments we make in rewards and other
    compelling value propositions for Cardmembers drive Card usage
    at merchants and encourage Cardmember loyalty. This business
    model, along with our closed-loop network, in which we are both
    the Card issuer and, in most instances, the merchant acquirer,
    gives us a competitive advantage that we seek to leverage to
    provide more value to Cardmembers, merchants and our
    Card-issuing partners.


 



    The
    American Express Brand


 


    Our brand and its attributes—trust, security, integrity,
    quality and customer service—are key assets of the Company.
    We continue to focus on our brand by educating employees about
    these attributes and by incorporating them into our programs,
    products and services. Our brand has consistently been rated one
    of the most valuable brands in the world in published studies,
    and we believe it provides us with a significant competitive
    advantage.


 


    We believe our brand and its attributes are critical to our
    success, and we invest heavily in managing, marketing and
    promoting it. In addition, we place significant importance on
    trademarks, service marks and patents, and diligently protect
    our intellectual property rights around the world.



 



    GLOBAL
    NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES


 


    The Global Network & Merchant Services
    (“GNMS”) segment operates a global general-purpose
    charge and credit card network for both proprietary Cards and
    Cards issued under the global network services business. It also
    manages merchant services globally, which includes signing
    merchants to accept Cards as well as processing and settling
    Card transactions for those merchants. This segment also offers
    merchants
    point-of-sale,
    servicing and settlement, fraud prevention services, and
    marketing and information products and services.


 


    Cards bearing our logo are issued by our principal operating
    subsidiary, TRS, by the Company’s U.S. bank
    subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (“Centurion
    Bank”) and American Express Bank, FSB (“AEBFSB”),
    and by other operating and bank subsidiaries outside the United
    States. They are accepted at all merchant locations worldwide
    that accept American Express-branded Cards. In addition,
    depending on the product, Cards bearing our logo are generally
    accepted at ATM locations worldwide that accept Cards. TRS and
    its subsidiaries, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, issue the
    majority of Cards on our network.


 


    Our Global Network Services (“GNS”) business
    establishes and maintains relationships with banks and other
    institutions around the world that issue Cards and, in certain
    countries, acquire local merchants on the American Express
    network. GNS is key to our strategy of broadening the Cardmember
    and merchant base for our network worldwide.


 


    Our Global Merchant Services (“GMS”) business provides
    us with access to rich transaction data through our closed-loop
    network, which encompasses relationships with both the
    Cardmember and the merchant. This capability helps us acquire
    new merchants, deepen relationships with existing merchants,
    process transactions, and provide targeted marketing, analytical
    and other value-added services to merchants in our network. In
    addition, it allows us to analyze trends and spending patterns
    among various segments of our customer base.


 



    Global
    Network Services


 


    We continue to pursue a strategy, through our GNS business, of
    inviting U.S. and foreign banks and other institutions to
    issue Cards and acquire merchants on the American Express
    network. By leveraging our global infrastructure and the appeal
    of the American Express brand, we broaden our Cardmember and
    merchant base for our network worldwide. The GNS business has
    established 129 card-issuing
    and/or
    merchant-acquiring arrangements with banks and other
    institutions in 131 countries.

Table of Contents





    In 2010, GNS signed four new partners to issue Cards
    and/or
    acquire merchants on the American Express network. Additionally,
    GNS partners launched approximately 77 new products during 2010,
    bringing the total number of American Express-branded GNS
    partner products to approximately 1,000.


 


    GNS focuses on partnering with qualified third-party banks and
    other financial institutions that choose to issue Cards accepted
    on our global network
    and/or
    acquire merchants on our network. Although we customize our
    network arrangements to the particular country and each
    partner’s requirements, as well as to our strategic plans
    in that marketplace, all GNS arrangements are designed to help
    issuers develop products for their highest-spending and most
    affluent customers and to support the value of American Express
    Card acceptance to merchants. We choose to partner with
    institutions that share a core set of attributes compatible with
    the American Express brand, such as commitment to high quality
    standards and strong marketing expertise, and we require
    adherence to our product, brand and service standards.**


 


    As discussed below, while GNS has added significant partners in
    2010, a core strategy of GNS is to build and invest in deeper
    and more meaningful relationships with its existing partners.


 


    With approximately 1,000 different Card products launched on our
    network so far by our partners, GNS is an increasingly important
    business that is strengthening our brand visibility around the
    world, driving more transaction volume onto our merchant network
    and increasing the number of merchants accepting the American
    Express Card. GNS enables us to expand our network’s global
    presence generally without assuming additional Cardmember credit
    risk or having to invest a large amount of resources, as our GNS
    partners already have established attractive customer bases they
    can target with American Express-branded products, and are
    responsible for managing the credit risk associated with the
    Cards they issue. Since 1999,
    Cards-in-force
    issued by GNS partners have grown at a compound annual growth
    rate of 24%, and totaled over 29 million Cards at the end
    of 2010. Outside the United States, 75% of new Cards issued in
    2010 were Cards issued by GNS partners. Spending on GNS Cards
    has grown at a compound annual rate of 25% since 1999.
    Year-over-year
    spending growth on these Cards in 2010 was 28%, with total
    spending equal to $92 billion.


 


    In assessing whether a given country should be proprietary, GNS,
    or some combination thereof, we consider a wide range of
    country-specific factors including the stability and
    attractiveness of returns, the size of the affluent segment, the
    strength of available marketing and credit data, the size of
    co-brand opportunities and how best can we create strong
    merchant value.


 



    GNS
    Arrangements


 


    Although the structures and details of each of the GNS
    arrangements vary, all of them generate revenues for us from the
    Card transaction volumes they drive on the American Express
    network. Gross revenues we receive per dollar spent on a Card
    issued by a GNS partner are generally lower than those from our
    proprietary Card-issuing business. However, because the GNS
    partner is responsible for most of the operating costs and risk
    of its Card-issuing business, our operating expenses and credit
    losses are generally lower than those in our proprietary
    Card-issuing business. The GNS business model generates an
    attractive earnings stream and risk profile that requires a
    lower level of capital support. The return on equity in our GNS
    business can thus be significantly higher than that of our
    proprietary Card-issuing business. In addition, since the
    majority of GNS costs are fixed, the GNS business is highly
    scalable. GNS partners benefit from their association with the
    American Express brand and their ability to gain attractive
    revenue streams and expand and differentiate their product
    offerings with innovative marketing programs.


 


    Our GNS arrangements fall into the following three main
    categories: Independent Operator Arrangements, Network Card
    License Arrangements and Joint Venture Arrangements.



  

          ** The use of the term
    “partner” or “partnering” does not mean or
    imply a formal legal partnership, and is not meant in any way to
    alter the terms of American Express’ relationship with
    third-party issuers and merchant acquirers.

    Independent
    Operator Arrangements


 


    The first type of GNS arrangement is known as an independent
    operator (“IO”) arrangement. As of the end of 2010, we
    had 64 of these arrangements around the world. We pursue these
    arrangements to expand the presence of the American Express
    network in countries in which we do not offer a proprietary
    local currency Card. The partner’s local presence and
    relationships help us enhance the impact of our brand in the
    country, reach merchant coverage goals more quickly, and operate
    at economic scale and cost levels that would be difficult for us
    to achieve on our own. Subject to meeting our standards, IO bank
    partners are licensed to issue local currency Cards in their
    countries, including the classic Green, Gold and Platinum
    American Express Cards. In addition, the majority of these
    partners serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local
    merchants. American Express retains the relationship with
    multinational merchants. Our IO partners own the customer
    relationships and credit risk for the Cards they issue, and make
    the decisions about which customers will be issued Cards. GNS
    generates revenues in IO arrangements from Card licensing fees,
    royalties on Cardmember billings, foreign exchange conversion
    revenue, royalties on charge volume at merchants, share of
    discount revenue and, in some partnerships, royalties on net
    spread revenue or royalties on
    cards-in-force.
    Our IO partners are responsible for transaction authorization,
    billing and pricing, Cardmember and merchant servicing, and
    funding Card receivables for their Cards and payables for their
    merchants.


 


    We bear the credit risk arising from the IO partner’s
    potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We
    mitigate this risk by partnering with institutions that we
    believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations,
    and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with
    the terms of their relationship with us and the political,
    economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In
    addition, depending on an IO partner’s credit rating and
    other indicators of financial health, we may require an IO
    partner to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other
    collateral to reduce this risk.


 


    Examples of countries where we have entered into IO arrangements
    include Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Ecuador,
    Greece, South Korea, Pakistan, Croatia, Peru, Portugal and
    Vietnam. Through our IO partnerships, we believe we can
    accelerate growth in Cardmember spending,
    Cards-in-force
    and merchant acceptance in these countries.


 



    Network
    Card License Arrangements


 


    The second type of GNS arrangement is known as a network card
    license (“NCL”). At the end of 2010, we had 61 of
    these arrangements in place worldwide. We pursue these
    arrangements to increase our brand presence and gain share in
    countries in which we have a proprietary Card-issuing
    and/or
    merchant acquiring business and, in a few cases, those in which
    we have IO partners. In an NCL arrangement, we grant the
    third-party financial institution a license to issue American
    Express-branded Cards. The NCL issuer owns the customer
    relationships for all Cards it issues, provides customer service
    to its Cardmembers, authorizes transactions, manages billing and
    credit, is responsible for marketing the Cards, and designs Card
    product features (including rewards and other incentives for
    Cardmembers), subject to meeting certain standards. We operate
    the merchant network, route and process Card transactions from
    the merchant’s
    point-of-sale
    through submission to the issuer, and settle with issuers. The
    NCL is the type of arrangement we have implemented with banks in
    the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.


 


    GNS’ revenues in NCL arrangements are driven by a variety
    of factors, including the level of Cardmember spending,
    royalties, currency conversions and licensing fees paid by the
    partner and fees charged to the Card issuer based on charge
    volume, and our provision of value-added services such as
    Cardmember insurance products and other Card features and
    benefits for the issuer’s Cards. As indicated above, the
    NCL issuer bears the credit risk for the issued Cards, as well
    as the Card marketing and acquisition costs, Cardmember fraud
    risks and costs of rewards and other loyalty initiatives. We
    bear the risk arising from the NCL partner’s potential
    failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We mitigate
    this risk by partnering with institutions that we believe are
    financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by
    monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the
    terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic
    and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition,
    depending on an NCL issuer’s credit rating and





    
    6



Table of Contents





    other indicators of financial health, we may require an NCL
    issuer to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other
    collateral to reduce this risk.


 


    Examples of NCL arrangements include our relationships with Bank
    of America in the United States, Lloyds TSB Bank in the United
    Kingdom and Westpac Banking Corporation in Australia.


 



    Joint
    Venture Arrangements


 


    The third type of GNS arrangement is a joint venture
    (“JV”) arrangement. We have utilized this type of
    arrangement in Switzerland and Belgium, as well as in other
    countries. In these countries, we join with a third-party to
    establish a separate business in which we have a significant
    ownership stake. The JV typically signs new merchants to the
    American Express network and issues local currency Cards that
    carry our logo. In a JV arrangement, the JV is responsible for
    the Cardmember credit risk and bears the operating and marketing
    costs. Unlike the other two types of GNS arrangements, we share
    management, risk, and profit and loss responsibility with our JV
    partners. Income is generated by discount revenues, card fees
    and net spread revenues. The economics of the JV are similar to
    those of our proprietary Card-issuing business, which we discuss
    under “U.S. Card Services,” and we receive a
    portion of the JV’s income depending on, among other
    things, the level of our ownership interest. Our subsidiary,
    AEOCC Ltd., purchases card receivables from certain of the GNS
    JVs from time to time.

    in 2010 include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Announcement of a new partnership for Macy’s and
    Bloomingdale’s credit cards to be co-branded exclusively
    with American Express and issued by Citibank




 



     
        • 

    
    Announcement of a new partnership with Regions Bank in the
    U.S. to launch the Regions
    Reservesm

    American
    Express®

    Card, developed for Regions Bank’s Private Banking clients
    and issued by Bank of America.





 



    Global
    Merchant Services


 


    We operate a GMS business, which includes signing merchants to
    accept Cards, accepting and processing Card transactions, and
    settling with merchants that accept Cards for purchases made by
    Cardmembers with Cards (“Charges”). We also provide
    marketing information, and other programs and services to
    merchants, leveraging the capabilities provided by our
    investments in our closed-loop structure, as well as
    point-of-sale
    products, servicing, and fraud prevention services.


 


    Our objective is for Cardmembers to be able to use the Card
    wherever and however they desire, and to increase merchant
    coverage in key geographic areas and in selected new industries
    that have not traditionally accepted the Card. We add new
    merchants to our network through a number of sales channels: a
    proprietary sales force, third-party sales and service agents,
    strategic alliances with banks and processors, the Internet,
    telemarketing and inbound “Want to Honor” calls (i.e.,
    where merchants desiring to accept the Card contact us
    directly). As discussed in the “Global Network
    Services” section, our IO partners and JVs also add new
    local merchants to the American Express network.


 


    During 2010, we continued expanding our integrated American
    Express
    OnePoint®

    solution for small- and medium-sized merchants in the United
    States. Under this program, third-party service agents provide
    payment processing services to merchants on our behalf for Card
    transactions, while we retain the acceptance contract with
    participating merchants, manage merchant pricing decisions and
    negotiations, and receive the same transactional information we
    always have received through our closed-loop network. This
    program simplifies card processing for small- and medium-sized
    merchants by providing them with a single source for statements,
    settlement and customer service. We are now following a similar
    strategy to our OnePoint solution in Spain through our
    arrangement with La Caixa, one of Spain’s largest
    acquirers.


 


    GMS continues to significantly expand the number of merchants
    that accept our Card products as well as the kinds of businesses
    that accept the Card. Over the last several years, we have
    focused our efforts on increasing the use of our Cards for
    everyday spending. In 1990, 64% of our U.S. billings came
    from the travel and entertainment sectors and 36% came from
    retail and other sectors. That proportion has now been more than
    reversed. In 2010, U.S. non-travel and entertainment
    billings represented approximately 71.5% of the U.S. billed
    business on American Express Cards. This shift resulted, in
    part, from the growth, over time, in the types of merchants that
    began to accept charge and credit cards in response to
    consumers’ increased desire to use these cards for more of
    their purchases, our focus on expanding Card acceptance to meet
    Cardmembers’ needs, and increased competition from our
    competitors for travel and entertainment sector spending.


 


    During 2010, we continued our efforts to bring Card acceptance
    to industries where cash or checks are the predominant form of
    payment. For example, we have made headway in promoting Card
    acceptance in industries such as pharmaceuticals, construction,
    industrial supply, insurance and advertising. Card acceptance
    agreements signed in 2010 in the United States include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Mercury Insurance Group, a leading insurance company




 



     
        • 

    
    BDO USA, LLP, a leading professional services firm providing
    assurance, tax, financial advisory and consulting services




 



     
        • 

    
    Applied Medical, a global medical device company that develops,
    manufactures and markets medical devices used in surgical
    procedures.

    Internationally, among others, Card acceptance agreements were
    reached with:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Centro de Recaudaciones de Impuestos Municipales (CRIM), the tax
    collections governmental agency in Puerto Rico & the
    Caribbean




 



     
        • 

    
    Municipio de Naucalpan in Mexico




 



     
        • 

    
    AAMI, one of Australia’s largest and highest profile
    general insurance companies




 



     
        • 

    
    Ageas Insurance Solutions in the United Kingdom.





 


    Additionally, we continued our drive to expand Card acceptance
    for retail and everyday spending categories outside the United
    States. For example, during 2010, we announced Card acceptance
    agreements with:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Seven Eleven, now accepting the Card in Mexico




 



     
        • 

    
    Best Buy, now accepting the Card in the United Kingdom




 



     
        • 

    
    Kaiser’s Tengelmann AG, now an accepting supermarket
    merchant in Germany.





 


    Globally, acceptance of general-purpose charge and credit cards
    continues to increase. As in prior years, during 2010, we
    continued to grow merchant acceptance of Cards around the world
    and to refine our approach to calculating merchant coverage in
    accordance with changes in the marketplace. Management estimates
    that, as of the end of 2010, our merchant network in the United
    States accommodated more than 90% of our Cardmembers’
    general-purpose charge and credit card spending, and our
    international merchant network as a whole accommodated
    approximately 80% of our Cardmembers’ general-purpose
    charge and credit card spending. These percentages are based on
    comparing our Cardmembers’ spending on our network
    currently with our estimate of what our Cardmembers would spend
    on our network if all merchants that accept general-purpose
    credit and charge cards accepted American Express Cards.


 


    We earn “discount” revenue from fees charged to
    merchants for accepting Cards as payment for goods or services
    sold. The merchant discount is the fee charged to the merchant
    for accepting Cards and is generally expressed as a percentage
    of the amount charged on a Card. In some instances, an
    additional flat transaction fee is assessed. The merchant
    discount is generally deducted from the amount of the payment
    that the “merchant acquirer” (in most cases, including
    for all U.S. merchants, TRS or one of its subsidiaries)
    pays to a merchant for Charges submitted. A merchant acquirer is
    the entity that contracts for Card acceptance with the merchant,
    accepts transactions from the merchant, pays the merchant for
    these transactions and submits the transactions to the American
    Express network, which submits the transactions to the
    appropriate Card issuer. When a Cardmember presents the Card for
    payment, the merchant creates a record of charge for the
    transaction and submits it to the merchant acquirer for payment.
    To the extent that TRS or one of its subsidiaries is the
    merchant acquirer, the merchant discount is recorded by us as
    discount revenue at the time the transaction is received by us
    from the merchant.


 


    Where we act as the merchant acquirer and the Card presented at
    a merchant is issued by a third-party bank or financial
    institution, such as in the case of our GNS partners, we will
    make financial settlement to the merchant and receive the
    discount revenue. In our role as the operator of the Card
    network, we will also receive financial settlement from the Card
    issuer, who receives an issuer rate (i.e., the individually
    negotiated amount that Card issuers receive for transactions
    charged on our network with Cards they issue, which is usually
    expressed as a percentage of the charged amount). The difference
    between the discount revenue (received by us in the form of the
    merchant discount) and the issuer rate received by the Card
    issuer generates a return to us. In cases where American Express
    is the Card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third-party
    bank or financial institution (which can be the case in a
    country in which the IO is the local merchant acquirer), we
    receive an individually negotiated issuer rate in our settlement
    with the merchant acquirer, which is recorded by us as discount
    revenue. By contrast with networks such as Visa and MasterCard,
    there is no collectively set interchange rate on the American
    Express network.

    The following diagrams depict the relationships among the
    parties in a
    point-of-sale
    transaction effected on the American Express network where we
    act as both the Card issuer and merchant acquirer (the
    “3-Party Model”) and under an NCL arrangement where
    third-party financial institutions act as Card issuers (the
    “NCL Model”):


 


    


 


    The merchant discount we charge reflects the value we deliver to
    the merchant and generally represents a premium over the rates
    charged for acceptance of many cards issued on other networks.
    We deliver greater value to merchants in a variety of ways,
    including through higher spending by our Cardmembers relative to
    users of cards issued on competing card networks, our product
    and network features and functionality, our marketing expertise
    and programs, information services, fraud prevention services,
    and other investments which enhance the merchant value
    propositions associated with acceptance of the Card.


 


    The merchant discount varies, among other factors, with the
    industry in which the merchant does business, the
    merchant’s Charge volume, the timing and method of payment
    to the merchant, the method of submission of Charges and, in
    certain instances, the geographic scope of the Card acceptance
    agreement signed with us (local or global) and the Charge amount.


 


    In prior years, we experienced some reduction in our global
    weighted average merchant discount rate. The average discount
    rate was 2.55 percent and 2.54 percent for 2010 and
    2009, respectively. Over time, certain repricing initiatives,
    changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing
    discounts and investments will likely result in some erosion of
    the average discount rate.


 


    While most merchants that accept our Cards understand our
    merchant discount pricing in relation to the value provided, we
    do encounter a relatively small number of merchants that accept
    our Cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept
    another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of the
    Card. Subject to local legal requirements (such as, by way of
    example, Dodd-Frank), we respond to this issue vigorously to
    ensure that our Cardmembers are able to use their Card where and
    when they want to and to protect the American Express brand. We
    have made progress limiting Card suppression by focusing on
    acquiring merchants where Cardmembers want to use the Card;
    continuing to enhance the value we provide to merchants through
    programs such as DailyWish and American Express Selects, which
    enable merchants of





    
    10



Table of Contents





    any size to gain valuable exposure and additional sales by
    providing exclusive offers and experiences to American Express
    Cardmembers; developing and providing new and innovative
    business insights, marketing programs and fraud prevention tools
    using information available through our closed-loop network;
    providing better and earlier communication of our value
    proposition; and, when appropriate, exercising our right to
    terminate Card acceptance agreements with merchants who seek to
    suppress the use of our Card products. We have a client
    management organization which is dedicated to growing our
    merchant customers’ business and finding ways to enhance
    effectiveness of our relationship with these key business
    partners. Most importantly, we recognize that it is the
    merchant’s choice whether or not to accept American Express
    cards and that all merchants have numerous options given the
    intense competition from new and traditional forms of payment.
    Therefore, we dedicate substantial resources to delivering
    superior and differentiated value to attract and retain our
    merchant customers.


 


    The laws of a number of states in the U.S. and certain
    countries outside the U.S. prohibit surcharging credit card
    purchases. American Express’ Card acceptance agreements
    with merchants generally do not prohibit surcharging so long as
    it is permitted by law and a merchant does not discriminate
    against the Card by surcharging higher amounts on purchases with
    the Card than on purchases with other cards, or by imposing a
    surcharge only on Card purchases, but not on purchases made with
    other cards. American Express also does not prohibit merchants
    from offering discounts to customers who pay with cash, check or
    Automated Clearing House (i.e., inter-bank transfers or
    “ACH”). In addition, American Express does not
    prohibit U.S. merchants from offering discounts or in-kind
    incentives to customers who pay with particular forms of payment
    in accordance with the provisions of Dodd-Frank, which was
    enacted in July 2010. For information concerning the proceeding
    against us recently brought by the DOJ and certain state
    attorneys general alleging violation of the U.S. antitrust
    laws with regard to certain provisions of our merchant
    agreements that are designed to protect our Cardmembers and our
    brand against discrimination at the point of sale, please see
    “Corporate Matters” within “Legal
    Proceedings” beginning on page 91.


 


    GMS is focused on understanding and addressing factors that
    influence merchant satisfaction, including developing and
    executing innovative programs that increase Card usage at
    merchants, using technology resources, enhancing operational
    efficiencies and merchants’ ease of doing business with us,
    providing a suite of online servicing tools, making our United
    States operating procedures easily available to merchants on our
    Web site, applying our closed-loop capabilities and deep
    marketing expertise, and strengthening our relationships with
    merchants through an expanding roster of services that helps
    them meet their business goals.


 


    We also offer our merchant customers a full range of
    point-of-sale
    solutions, including integrated
    point-of-sale
    terminals, software, online solutions, and direct links that
    allow merchants to accept American Express Cards (as well as
    credit and debit cards issued on other networks and checks).
    Virtually all proprietary
    point-of-sale
    solutions support direct processing (i.e., direct connectivity)
    to American Express, which can lower a merchant’s cost of
    Card acceptance and enhance payment efficiency.


 


    In November 2010, we acquired Accertify Inc., a leading provider
    of solutions that help merchants combat fraudulent online and
    other card-not-present transactions. Launched in 2007, Accertify
    provides a hosted software application that offers an extra
    level of security for transactions over any of the major payment
    networks, including American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover
    and PayPal, or any other alternative payment method. Accertify
    also offers merchants the option to outsource their
    end-to-end
    fraud management process. With the acquisition of Accertify,
    American Express is able to broaden its fraud prevention
    services to merchants for transactions that take place on all
    networks. Accertify’s capabilities are incremental and
    complementary to American Express’ fraud solutions already
    offered to merchants for transactions on the American Express
    network.


 


    In November 2010, we also announced the launch of American
    Express
    SafeKeysm,

    an online fraud prevention solution, which licenses Visa’s
    3-D Secure
    Protocol, a technology embraced by the payments industry as a
    global standard for payment authentication.


 


    We continue to focus our commitment to driving global
    interoperability in payment card specifications, making it
    easier for merchants to accept our Cards, for Cardmembers to
    have a more seamless experience at





    
    11



Table of Contents





    the point of sale, and for issuers who have more than one
    network relationship to have a standard across their card
    products.


 


    We are an owner-member of EMVCo, the standards body that
    manages, maintains, and enhances specifications for chip-based
    payment cards and acceptance devices, including
    point-of-sale
    terminals. Our participation in this company helps to drive
    secure and interoperable payments globally for transactions made
    with chip cards by aligning and progressing the EMV
    specifications. Further, as EMVCo’s scope expands to
    include emerging payment technologies such as contactless cards
    and mobile phones, our participation will facilitate our
    products and specifications being universally compatible and
    ready for merchant acceptance.


 


    We continue to focus our efforts in areas that make use and
    acceptance of the Card more convenient for merchants and
    Cardmembers. For instance, American Express offers a contactless
    payment feature embedded in certain cards, to provide a fast,
    easy-to-use alternative to cash, check, debit or other payment
    forms, particularly for making everyday purchases at merchants
    where speed and convenience is important. In the U.S., top
    quick-service restaurants, movie theaters, drug and convenience
    stores and major retail chains readily accept American Express
    contactless payments. Similarly, Automatic Bill Payment focuses
    on providing convenience by allowing merchants to bill
    Cardmembers on a regular basis for recurring charges approved by
    the Cardmember such as insurance premiums, newspaper
    subscriptions, health club memberships, commutation costs and
    telecommunication services. Additionally, to provide extra
    convenience and speed at the point of sale, low value
    transactions (under $25 in the U.S.) do not require a signature.


 


    Wherever we manage both the acquiring relationship with
    merchants and the Card-issuing side of the business, there is a
    “closed-loop,” which distinguishes our network from
    the bankcard networks, in that we have access to information at
    both ends of the Card transaction. We maintain direct
    relationships with both our Cardmembers and our merchants, and
    we handle all key aspects of those relationships.


 


    Our relationships allow us to analyze information on Cardmember
    spending. This enables us to provide targeted marketing and
    other information services for merchants and special offers and
    services to Cardmembers through a variety of channels. Recently,
    we created a business within GMS called American
    Express®

    Business Insights, which offers products and services derived
    from our strong business model and closed loop network. Business
    Insights combines aggregated, non-personally identifiable data
    and trend analysis to provide specialized business planning and
    marketing expertise to our customers. At the same time, we
    protect the confidentiality of information on Cardmember
    spending, and comply with our privacy and firewall policies and
    applicable legal requirements.


 


    We work closely with our Card-issuing and merchant-acquiring
    bank partners to maintain key elements of this closed-loop,
    which permits them to customize marketing efforts, deliver
    greater value to their Cardmembers and help us to direct
    increased business to merchants who accept the Card.


 


    As the merchant acquirer, we have certain exposures that arise
    if a billing dispute between a Cardmember and a merchant is
    settled in favor of the Cardmember. Drivers of this liability
    are returns in the normal course of business, disputes over
    fraudulent charges, the quality or non-delivery of goods and
    services and billing errors. Typically, we offset the amount due
    to the Cardmember against payments for the merchant’s
    current or future Charge submissions. We can realize losses when
    a merchant’s offsetting Charge submissions cease, such as
    when the merchant decides to no longer accept the Card,
    commences a bankruptcy proceeding or goes out of business. We
    actively monitor our merchant base to assess the risk of this
    exposure. When appropriate, we will take action to reduce the
    net exposure to a given merchant by holding cash reserves funded
    through Charge payable holdbacks from a merchant, lengthening
    the time between when the merchant submits a Charge for payment
    and when we pay the merchant requiring the merchant to secure a
    letter of credit or a parent company guarantee, or implementing
    other appropriate risk management tools. We also establish
    reserves on our balance sheet for these contingencies in
    accordance with relevant accounting rules.


 


    With the increase in electronic transmission of payment card
    transaction data over merchants’
    point-of-sale
    systems, American Express and other card networks recognized the
    necessity for merchants and merchant processors to secure this
    data against accidental or intentional compromise using a
    standard protocol that applies to all card types. We and
    Discover Financial Services, JCB Co., Ltd., MasterCard Worldwide
    and





    
    12



Table of Contents





    Visa formed PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (“PCI
    SSC”), an independent standards-setting organization. PCI
    SSC’s role is to manage the Payment Card Industry
    (“PCI”) Data Security Standard, and more recently the
    PCI PIN Entry Device (“PED”) Security Requirements and
    the Payment Application Data Security Standard, which focus on
    improving payment card account security throughout the
    transaction process. By establishing PCI SSC, we and the other
    founders have developed common standards that are more
    accessible and efficient for participants in the payment card
    industry. All our merchants and service providers that store,
    process and transmit payment card data are required to comply
    with the PCI Data Security Standard. PCI SSC is dedicated to
    driving greater education, awareness and adoption of these
    security standards to ensure that all stakeholders involved in
    the payment process conduct their business responsibly.


 


    In some markets outside the United States, particularly in Asia,
    third-party processors and some bankcard acquirers offer
    merchants the capability of converting credit card transactions
    from the local currency to the currency of the cardholder’s
    residence (i.e., the cardholder’s billing currency) at the
    point-of-sale,
    and submitting the transaction in the cardholder’s billing
    currency, thus bypassing the traditional foreign currency
    conversion process of the card network. This practice is known
    as “dynamic currency conversion.” If a merchant
    utilizes a dynamic currency conversion process, the merchant and
    processor share any fee assessed or spread earned for converting
    the transaction at the
    point-of-sale,
    thus reducing or eliminating revenue for card issuers and card
    networks relating to the conversion of foreign charges to the
    cardholder’s billing currency. This practice is still not
    widespread, and it remains uncertain whether its use will expand
    over time. Our policy generally requires merchants to submit
    Charges and be paid in the currency of the country in which the
    transaction occurs, and we convert the transaction to the
    Cardmember’s billing currency.


 



    Global
    Network & Merchant Services —
    Competition


 


    Our global card network, including our Global Merchant Services
    and Global Network Services businesses, competes in the global
    payments industry with other card networks, including, among
    others, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club International (which was
    acquired by Discover Financial Services), and Discover
    (primarily in the United States). We are the third largest
    general-purpose charge and credit card network based on charge
    volume, behind Visa and MasterCard, which we believe are larger
    than we are in most countries. In addition, apart from such
    network services, a range of companies globally, including
    merchant acquirers and processors, carry out some activities
    similar to those performed by our GMS and GNS businesses. No
    single entity participates on a global basis in the full range
    of activities that are encompassed by our closed-loop business
    model.


 


    The principal competitive factors that affect the network and
    merchant service businesses include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the number of
    Cards-in-force
    and amount of spending on these Cards




 



     
        • 

    
    the quantity and quality of the establishments where the Cards
    can be used




 



     
        • 

    
    the economic attractiveness to card issuers and merchants of
    participating in the network




 



     
        • 

    
    the success of marketing and promotional campaigns




 



     
        • 

    
    reputation and brand recognition




 



     
        • 

    
    innovation and investment in systems, technology, product and
    service offerings, particularly in on-line commerce




 



     
        • 

    
    the quality of customer service




 



     
        • 

    
    the security of Cardmember and merchant information




 



     
        • 

    
    the impact of existing litigation, legislation and government
    regulation




 



     
        • 

    
    the cost of Card acceptance relative to the value provided.





 


    Another aspect of network competition is the recent emergence
    and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms and systems,
    which include aggregators (such as PayPal), wireless payment
    technologies





    
    13



Table of Contents





    (including using mobile telephone networks to carry out
    transactions), prepaid systems and systems linked to payment
    cards, and bank transfer models.


 


    New technologies, together with the portability provided by
    smartphones and tablets and evolving consumer behavior with
    social networking, are rapidly changing the way people interact
    with each other and transact business all around the world. In
    this connection, traditional and non-traditional competitors
    such as mobile telecommunications companies are working to
    deliver digital and mobile payment services for both consumers
    and merchants. While we estimate that we have the largest share
    of online spending of any major card issuer and more global
    online billings volume than PayPal, the competition remains
    fierce for capturing online spend in the ever-increasing digital
    world.


 


    To the extent alternative payment mechanisms and systems, such
    as aggregators, continue to successfully expand, discount
    revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our
    closed-loop network, and potentially other revenues could be
    negatively impacted. In the United States, alternative payment
    vehicles that seek to redirect customers to payment systems
    based on ACH continue to emerge and grow, and existing debit
    networks also continue to expand both on- and off-line and are
    making efforts to develop online PIN functionality, which could
    further reduce the relative use of charge and credit cards
    online. For a discussion concerning our involvement in the
    emerging payments area, please see “Enterprise Growth”
    beginning on page 34 below.


 


    Some of our competitors have attempted to replicate our
    closed-loop functionality, such as Visa, with its Visa Incentive
    Network. Although it remains to be seen how effective Visa will
    be, efforts by Visa and other card networks and payment
    providers to replicate the closed-loop speak to its continued
    value and to the intensely competitive environment in which we
    operate.


 



    Global
    Network & Merchant Services —
    Regulation


 


    Local regulations governing the issuance of charge and credit
    cards have not been a significant factor impacting GNS’
    arrangements with banks and qualifying financial institutions,
    because such banks and institutions generally are already
    authorized to issue general-purpose cards and, in the case of
    our IO arrangements, to operate merchant-acquiring businesses.
    Accordingly, our GNS partners have generally not had difficulty
    obtaining appropriate government authorization in the countries
    in which we have chosen to enter into GNS arrangements. As a
    service provider to regulated U.S. banks, our GNS business
    is subject to review by certain federal bank regulators,
    including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of
    the Currency (“OCC”) and the Office of Thrift
    Supervision (“OTS”).


 


    As the operator of a general-purpose card network, we are also
    subject to certain provisions of the Currency and Foreign
    Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations
    issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively
    referred to as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by
    the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”). We
    conduct due diligence on our GNS partners to ensure that they
    have implemented and maintain sufficient anti-money laundering
    (“AML”) controls to prevent our network from being
    used for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. As a
    result of American Express Company and TRS each being bank
    holding companies, our business is also subject to further
    regulation and regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve. For
    additional information about our regulatory status, please see
    “Supervision and Regulation — General”
    beginning on page 38 below.


 


    In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the
    United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation
    of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card
    issuers and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards.
    Regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Poland,
    Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, the European Union, Australia,
    Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, among others, have conducted
    investigations that are either ongoing, concluded, or on appeal.


 


    The interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by
    the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in
    “four party” payment networks, like Visa and
    MasterCard, is generally the largest component of the merchant
    service charge payable by merchants for bankcard debit and
    credit card acceptance in these





    
    14



Table of Contents





    systems. By contrast, the American Express network does not have
    interchange fees. Although the regulators’ focus has
    primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the dominant card
    networks and their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust
    actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing
    could ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange
    and/or
    merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for
    other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual
    card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by
    scaling back or eliminating rewards programs.


 


    In the United States, Congress continued to focus on the
    interchange issue during 2010. Congress passed Dodd-Frank, which
    the President signed into law in July 2010. Dodd-Frank gives the
    Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding
    interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for
    transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use
    prepaid card, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that
    such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a
    transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the
    costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive
    network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions.
    American Express does not offer a debit card linked to a deposit
    account, but does issue various types of prepaid cards.
    Reloadable general-use prepaid cards, but not those marketed or
    labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, are exempt from the
    interchange fee limitations. In contrast to the interchange fee
    limitations, all prepaid cards would be subject to the exclusive
    network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions.
    In December 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a Notice of
    Proposed Rulemaking requesting comments to implement the
    interchange fee limitations and exclusive network routing
    restrictions. The Federal Reserve has proposed two options for
    the interchange limitations and describes two interpretations of
    the statutory language on the exclusive network routing
    restrictions. Comments on the proposal were due by
    February 22, 2011. The Federal Reserve must issue final
    rules on the interchange limitations by April 2011, and those
    rules take effect on July 21, 2011. The Federal Reserve
    must issue final rules on the exclusive network routing
    restrictions by July 21, 2011. The statute does not specify
    when those rules must take effect. The proposed rules issued by
    the Federal Reserve have garnered attention from members of
    Congress, and the relevant congressional committees have held
    hearings to review the proposal. It is difficult to assess at
    this time the extent to which the final regulations, once
    issued, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.


 


    Additionally, Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from
    restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to
    encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such
    as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that such offers
    do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer.
    Further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable
    state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all
    prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously
    disclosed. Dodd-Frank also permits U.S. merchants to
    establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for
    credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not
    discriminate between networks or issuers. Federal government
    agencies and institutions of higher learning are also permitted
    to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided
    they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. As a
    result of these new laws, customers may be incentivized by
    merchants to move away from the use of charge and credit card
    products to other forms of payment, such as debit, which could
    adversely affect our revenues and profitability. During the last
    four years, a number of bills were proposed in individual state
    legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange
    fees or to prohibit credit card companies from charging a
    merchant discount on the sales tax portion of credit card
    purchases. Other proposals were aimed at increasing the
    transparency of card network rules for merchants. In addition, a
    number of bills were proposed to establish merchant liability
    for the costs of a data security breach of a merchant’s
    system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to
    protect sensitive cardholder payment information. In 2010,
    Vermont enacted legislation that permits merchants to set a
    minimum dollar value of no more than $10 for acceptance of any
    form of payment; permits merchants to provide discounts or other
    benefits based on the form of payment (i.e., card, cash, check,
    debit card, stored-value card, charge card or credit card); and
    permits merchants to accept the cards of a payment system at one
    or more of its locations but not at others. This legislation may
    serve as a model for other states. In the event that additional
    legislative or regulatory activity to limit interchange or
    merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security
    legislation is adopted, our revenues and profitability could be
    adversely affected.

    In certain countries where antitrust actions or regulations have
    led our competitors to lower their fees, we have made
    adjustments to our pricing to merchants to reflect local
    competitive trends. For example, reductions in bankcard
    interchange mandated by the Reserve Bank of Australia in 2003
    resulted in lower merchant discount rates for Visa and
    MasterCard acceptance. As a result of changes in the
    marketplace, we reduced our own merchant discount rates in
    Australia over time, although we have been able to increase
    billed business and the number of merchants accepting our Cards.
    In addition, under legislation enacted in Argentina, a merchant
    acquirer is required to charge the same merchant discount rate
    to all merchants in the same industry category, and merchant
    discount rates for credit cards cannot exceed 3%. The Central
    Bank of Venezuela has issued regulations regarding the maximum
    level of merchant discount rates by industry category. In
    December 2007, the European Commission ruled that
    MasterCard’s multilateral interchange fees
    (“MIF”) for cross-border payment card transactions
    violate EC Treaty rules on restrictive business practices. The
    Commission’s decision applies to cross-border consumer
    credit, charge and debit card transactions within the EU and to
    domestic transactions to which MasterCard has chosen to apply
    the cross-border MIF. The ruling does not prevent MasterCard and
    its member banks from adopting an alternative MIF arrangement
    that can be proven to comply with EU Competition rules. Although
    the Commission’s investigation included commercial cards,
    it has reserved judgment for the time being on the legality of
    MasterCard’s cross-border MIF for commercial card
    transactions. MasterCard lodged an appeal against the
    Commission’s findings, which is pending. An interim
    settlement, pending the appeal, was agreed to in 2009 between
    the Commission and MasterCard, capping MIF at 30 basis
    points for consumer card transactions and 20 basis points
    for debit card transactions.


 


    In 2002, the Commission granted an exemption to Visa regarding
    its MIFs for cross-border consumer card transactions within
    Europe. This exemption expired on December 31, 2007 and in
    March 2008 the Commission opened formal antitrust proceedings
    against Visa Europe Limited in relation to Visa’s MIFs for
    such transactions. The Commission indicated that the MasterCard
    decision should “provide Visa with guidance for the way
    ahead,” although it stated that “every MIF must be
    examined on its own merits.” In 2010, the Commission
    accepted Visa Europe’s pledge to cut its cross-border debit
    card MIF to 20 basis points for four years. The
    Commission’s investigation into Visa Europe’s credit
    and deferred debit card MIF for cross-border transactions
    remains ongoing.


 


    Developments at the EU level may affect how the competition
    authorities in the Member States of the EU view domestic
    interchange and the progress of ongoing investigations. In 2007,
    for example, consistent with the Commission’s findings of
    that year in its case against MasterCard, the competition
    regulator in Poland found insufficient basis for Visa and
    MasterCard interchange fees and ordered the associations and
    their members to stop their current interchange setting
    practices. However, the banks appealed that decision, and in
    November 2008 the decision was overturned. The Polish
    Competition Authority has appealed that ruling. More recently,
    the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom indicated that
    it was delaying further consideration of its cases against
    MasterCard and Visa pending the outcome of the appeal of the
    European Commission’s decision against MasterCard.


 


    In 2010, national parliaments in Hungary and France enacted
    legislation to cap interchange fees or point of sale service
    charges without government sponsorship for these measures.
    Although in both cases the legislation has been either repealed
    or struck down on procedural grounds, it is possible there may
    be further attempts to enact regulation of merchant fees or
    interchange with direct or indirect impacts on American Express.


 


    In August 2009, Visa and MasterCard settled an anti-trust case
    with the New Zealand regulatory authorities regarding whether
    the setting of interchange rates constituted price fixing and
    whether other scheme rules lessened competition. The settlement
    results in changes to the Visa and MasterCard scheme rules,
    which will set maximum interchange rates and also allow
    bilateral setting of lower interchange rates between issuers and
    acquirers, as well as remove the schemes’ no surcharging
    rules. On April 17, 2010, each of the schemes released
    their maximum interchange rates. It is difficult to assess at
    this time the extent to which the changes to interchange could
    adversely impact our revenues and profitability in New Zealand.


 


    Regulators have also considered network rules that prohibit
    merchants from surcharging card purchases. In Australia, we have
    seen selective, but increasing, merchant surcharging on our
    Cards in certain industries





    
    16



Table of Contents





    and, in some cases, on a basis that is greater than that applied
    to cards issued on the bankcard networks. The member states of
    the European Economic Area have now implemented a relatively new
    legislative framework for electronic payment services, including
    cards, called the European Directive 2007/64/EC on payment
    services. This directive, commonly referred to as the Payment
    Services Directive, prescribes common rules for licensing and
    supervision of payment services providers, including card
    issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of
    business with customers. The objective of the Payment Services
    Directive is to facilitate the operation of a single internal
    payments market in the EU through harmonization of EU Member
    State laws governing payment services. One provision of the
    Payment Services Directive permits merchants to surcharge,
    subject to disclosure requirements, but also allows individual
    Member States to override this rule by prohibiting or limiting
    surcharging. To date, the member states of the European Economic
    Area are split on whether they prohibit or permit surcharging,
    with countries such as the United Kingdom (which for a number of
    years has permitted it for credit card purchases), the
    Netherlands and Spain permitting it, in some cases within
    limits, and other countries such as France, Italy and Sweden
    prohibiting it. All member states permit discounts. The Payment
    Services Directive complements another European initiative, the
    Single Euro Payments Area (“SEPA”), which is an
    industry-led initiative with support from EU institutions. Among
    other changes, SEPA involves the adoption of new, pan-European
    technical standards for cards and card transactions. All of the
    foregoing requires significant costs to implement and maintain.


 


    The Canadian Competition Bureau has commenced an application
    against Visa and MasterCard under the price maintenance
    provisions of the Canadian Competition Act seeking a remedial
    order prohibiting Visa and MasterCard from entering into,
    enforcing or imposing terms that restrain merchants from certain
    business practices, including encouraging use of lower cost
    methods of payment and discouraging use of credit cards with
    higher card acceptance fees, declining acceptance of certain
    credit cards and surcharging customers who use Visa and
    MasterCard credit cards. While the Competition Bureau did not
    name American Express in its application, this action evidences
    the strong regulatory and judicial focus on this area, which
    could have indirect implications for American Express.


 


    The Canadian Department of Finance requires Amex Bank of Canada
    as well as other payment networks, issuers and acquirers to
    adhere to the Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card
    Industry in Canada which among other things requires increased
    transparency and disclosure of fees in merchant agreements and
    monthly statements, requires 90 days notice of merchant fee
    increases or introduction of new fees and gives merchants the
    right to cancel their contract without penalty after receiving
    such notice, allows differential discounting by merchants
    between forms of payment and payment networks and requires that
    merchants provide their express consent to accept new products
    or services.

    Centurion
    Bank and AEBFSB as Issuers of Certain Cards


 


    We have two U.S. bank subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and
    AEBFSB, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of TRS. Each bank is
    an FDIC insured depository institution. The activities of
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to examination by their
    respective regulators. Both banks take steps to maintain
    compliance programs to address the various safety and soundness,
    internal control and compliance requirements, including
    anti-money laundering requirements that apply to them. You can
    find a further discussion of the anti-money laundering
    initiatives affecting us under “Corporate &

    July 21, 2011 is the “transfer date” of the
    OTS’s supervisory responsibility for federal savings banks

    capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least
    5%. For further discussion regarding capital adequacy, including

    Charge
    Cards


 


    Our charge Cards, which generally carry no preset spending
    limits, are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as
    a means of financing purchases of goods or services. Charges are
    approved based on a variety of factors including a
    Cardmember’s current spending patterns, payment history,
    credit record, and financial resources. Cardmembers generally
    must pay the full amount billed each month, and no finance
    charges are assessed on the balance. Charge Card accounts that
    are past due are subject, in most cases, to a delinquency
    assessment and, if not brought to current status, may be
    cancelled. The no preset-spending limit and
    pay-in-full
    nature of these products attract high-spending Cardmembers.


 


    The charge Cards also offer several ways for eligible U.S.
    Cardmembers to pay off certain of their purchases over time. The
    Sign &
    Travel®

    Feature permits eligible U.S. Cardmembers to extend payment
    for airline tickets, cruise ship tickets and other travel
    charges purchased with our charge Cards. The Extended Payment
    Option permits eligible U.S. Cardmembers to extend payment
    for eligible charges above a certain dollar amount.


 


    As part of our effort to deliver additional value for existing
    Cardmembers and to attract new high-spending customers to
    American Express, we launched in 2010 the following three new
    benefits for our Platinum
    Card®

    and Centurion
    Card®

    that will provide our consumer and
    OPEN®

    Cardmembers with improved value and service while traveling:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a $200 airline fee credit that allows Cardmembers to enroll and
    receive up to $200 annually on incidental fees on their airline
    of choice




 



     
        • 

    
    a 20% travel bonus benefit that gives back to Cardmembers 20% of
    the points they redeem for travel when they use Membership
    Rewards®

    Pay With Points




 



     
        • 

    
    a special version of the new American Express Travel iphone
    application.





 


    We also announced in December 2010 that we will eliminate
    foreign currency transaction fees for U.S. consumer and
    small business Cardmembers who make international purchases with
    their Platinum
    Cards®

    or
    Centurion®

    Cards, which is expected to be effective towards the end of the
    first quarter of 2011.


 


    In September 2010, we also announced that Continental Airlines
    will no longer participate in the Airport Club Access program
    for Centurion and Platinum Cardmembers or the Membership Rewards
    points transfer program as of October 1, 2011. However,
    Cardmembers will still be able to redeem points for travel on
    Continental
    Airlines®

    through Membership Rewards Pay with
    Points®.

    While Continental Airlines was a significant participant in the
    Airport Club Access Program and key redemption partner in our
    Membership Rewards points transfer program, we continue to
    strengthen our relationships with our Cardmembers by enhancing
    the value we provide through our premium offerings and benefits,
    including those listed above.


 


    In May 2010, we launched the
    ZYNC®

    Card from American Express, a new charge Card with a low annual
    fee of $25. Cardmembers get core charge Card features and
    protections on the base card with the added flexibility to
    select bundles of rewards and benefits called “Packs”
    that are tailored to specific lifestyle interests and spending
    habits in categories such as music, fashion, food, travel and
    more.

    Revolving
    Credit Cards


 


    We offer a variety of revolving credit Cards. These Cards have a
    range of different payment terms, interest rate and fee
    structures, rewards programs and Cardmember benefits. Revolving
    credit Card products, such as Blue from American Express, Blue
    Cash from American Express and Blue Sky from American Express,
    provide Cardmembers with the flexibility to pay their bill in
    full each month or carry a monthly balance on their Cards to
    finance the purchase of goods or services. Along with charge
    Cards and co-brand Cards, these revolving credit Cards attract
    affluent Cardmembers and promote increased relevance for our
    expanding merchant network.


 


    In 2010, we launched Blue Sky Preferred from American Express,
    which offers double Blue
    Skysm

    points on hotel, dining and car rental purchases which can be
    redeemed towards travel anywhere, anytime, on any airline with
    no blackout dates or restrictions. In addition, Cardmembers
    receive an annual $100 Airline Allowance for use on airline
    incidental fees (e.g., checked baggage fees, in-flight meals,
    etc.). Blue Sky
    Preferredsm

    Card is the first proprietary lending product in the Blue Card
    family with an annual fee, diversifying the revenue streams of
    this portfolio.


 



    Co-brand
    Cards


 


    We issue Cards under co-brand agreements with selected
    commercial firms in the United States. The competition among
    card issuers and networks for attractive co-brand card
    partnerships is quite intense because these partnerships can
    generate high-spending loyal cardholders. The duration of our
    co-brand arrangements generally ranges from five to ten years.
    Cardmembers earn rewards provided by the partners’
    respective loyalty programs based upon their spending on the
    co-brand Cards, such as frequent flyer miles, hotel loyalty
    points and cash back. We make payments to our co-brand partners,
    which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of
    Cardmember spending and corresponding rewards earned on such
    spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of
    accounts acquired and retained. We expense amounts due under
    co-brand arrangements in the month earned. Payment terms vary by
    arrangement, but are monthly or quarterly. Generally, once we
    make payment to the co-brand partner, the partner is solely
    liable for providing rewards to the Cardmember under the
    co-brand partner’s own loyalty program. As the issuer of
    the co-brand Card, we retain all the credit risk with the
    Cardmember and bear the receivables funding and operating
    expenses for such Cards. The co-brand partner retains the risk
    associated with the miles, points or other currency earned by
    the Cardmember under the partner’s loyalty program.


 


    During 2010, we introduced several new innovations to our
    existing products. For example, we launched the First Bag Free
    benefit which allows Gold, Platinum and Reserve Delta SkyMiles
    Credit Card Cardmembers to check their first bag for free on
    Delta Air Lines operated flights. We also launched two new
    benefits on the Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card and the
    Starwood Preferred Guest Business Credit Card that provides a 5
    night / 2 stay credit so Cardmembers earn elite status
    faster and an exclusive Sheraton Hotels and Resorts offer.


 



    Co-brand
    Partnerships with Financial Services Institutions


 


    We also issue Cards that are marketed under co-brand partnership
    arrangements with financial services partners. Such partnerships
    involve the offering of a standard product (issued by TRS or one
    of its subsidiaries) to customers of the financial services
    partner, generally co-branded with the partner’s name on
    the Card. Under these arrangements, we may make payments to the
    financial services partners that are primarily based on the
    number of accounts acquired
    and/or
    retained through the arrangement
    and/or the
    amount of Cardmember spending on such Cards. The duration of
    such arrangements generally ranges from three to seven years.


 



    Card
    Pricing and Account Management


 


    Certain Cards, particularly charge Cards, charge an annual fee
    that varies based on the type of Card and the number of Cards
    for each account. We also offer many revolving credit Cards with
    no annual fee but on which we assess finance charges for
    revolving balances. Depending on the product, we also charge





    
    20



Table of Contents





    Cardmembers an annual program fee to participate in the
    Membership Rewards programs and fees for account performance
    (e.g., late fees) or for certain services (e.g., additional
    copies of account statements). We apply standards and criteria
    for creditworthiness to each Cardmember through a variety of
    means both at the time of initial solicitation or application
    and on an ongoing basis during the Card relationship. We use
    sophisticated credit models and techniques in our risk
    management operations. For a further description of our risk
    management policies, please see “Risk Management”
    appearing on page 48 of our 2010 Annual Report to
    Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by
    reference.


 



    Membership
    Rewards®

    Program


 


    The Membership Rewards program from American Express allows
    Cardmembers to earn one point for virtually every dollar charged
    on eligible, enrolled American Express Cards, and then redeem
    points for a wide array of rewards, including travel, retail
    merchandise, dining and entertainment, financial services and
    even donations to benefit tens of thousands of charities. Points
    generally have no expiration date and there is no limit on the
    number of points one can earn. A large majority of spending by
    eligible Cardmembers earns points under this program.


 


    The U.S. Membership Rewards program has over 150 redemption
    partners and features over 500 merchandise brands. Membership
    Rewards program tiers are aligned with specific Card products to
    better meet Cardmember lifestyle and reward program usage needs.
    American Express Cardmembers participate in one of three
    Membership Rewards program tiers based on the Credit or Charge
    Card they have in their wallet. For those Cardmembers with
    American Express Cards, such as Blue from American Express and
    ZYNC from American Express, we have the Membership Rewards
    Express®

    program. American Express Charge Cardmembers with American
    Express Green and Gold Cards have the Membership
    Rewards®

    program. Platinum
    Card®

    members and
    Centurion®

    Cardmembers are enrolled in the Membership Rewards
    First®

    program.


 


    During the year, we enhanced our Membership
    Rewards®

    program with the introduction of new reward options designed to
    meet customer demand and provide Cardmembers with greater
    breadth and variety as well as utility. For example, we launched
    a new benefit that allows Membership Rewards points to be used
    for purchases on Amazon.com at the point of sale. In addition to
    this redemption option at Amazon, we have added a number of new
    partners to the program that give Cardmembers a broader range of
    opportunities to redeem points, such as Universal Studios Theme
    Parks, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Victoria’s Secret,
    Ruby Tuesday and Zynga. In addition, Cardmembers now have the
    ability to pay for their annual membership fee with Membership
    Rewards points. We believe our Membership Rewards point bank is
    a substantial asset and a competitive advantage, and is moving
    towards becoming a valued virtual currency.


 


    When a Cardmember enrolled in the Membership Rewards program
    uses the Card, we establish reserves to cover the cost of
    estimated future reward redemptions for points earned to date.
    When a Membership Rewards program enrollee redeems a reward
    using Membership Rewards points, we make a payment to the
    Membership Rewards program partner providing the reward pursuant
    to contractual arrangements. Membership Rewards expense is
    driven by Cardmember charge volume, customer participation in
    the program, and contractual arrangements with redemption
    partners. At year end, we estimated that current Cardmembers
    will ultimately redeem approximately 90% of their points. For
    more information on our Membership Rewards program, see
    “Critical Accounting Policies — Reserves for
    Membership Rewards Costs” appearing on page 25 of our
    2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is
    incorporated herein by reference.


 


    Membership Rewards continues to be an important driver of
    Cardmember spending and loyalty. We believe, based on historical
    experience, that Cardmembers enrolled in rewards programs yield
    higher spend, stronger credit performance and greater profit for
    us. By offering a broader range of redemption choices, we





    
    21



Table of Contents





    have given our Cardmembers more flexibility in the use of their
    rewards points and have favorably affected our average cost per
    point. We continually seek to optimize the overall economics of
    the program and make changes to enhance its value to
    Cardmembers. Our program is also valuable to merchants that
    become redemption partners as we bring them high-spending
    Cardmembers and new marketing channels to reach these
    Cardmembers.


 



    Cardmember
    Special Services and Programs


 


    Throughout the world, our Cardmembers have access to a variety
    of fee-free and fee-based special services and programs,
    depending on the type of Cards they have. Examples of these
    special services and programs include:

    Card-Issuing
    Business — Competition


 


    Our proprietary Card business encounters substantial and intense
    competition in the United States and internationally. As a card
    issuer, we compete in the United States with financial
    institutions (such as Citibank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase,
    and Capital One Financial) that issue general-purpose charge and
    revolving credit cards, and Discover Financial Services, which
    issues the Discover Card on the Discover Business Services
    network. We also encounter competition from businesses that
    issue their own cards or otherwise extend credit to their
    customers, such as retailers and airline associations, although
    these cards are generally accepted only at limited locations.
    Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial
    services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by
    major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of
    significant issuers. The largest competing issuers have
    continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card
    portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail
    branch networks.


 


    In recent years, we have encountered increasingly intense
    competition in the small business sector, as competitors have
    targeted OPEN’s customer base and our leadership position
    in providing financial services and other fee-based solutions to
    small businesses. Competing card issuers offer a variety of
    products and services to attract cardholders, including premium
    cards with enhanced services or lines of credit, airline
    frequent flyer program mileage credits, cash rebates and other
    reward or rebate programs, services for small business owners,
    “teaser” promotional interest rates for both credit
    card acquisition and balance transfers, and co-branded
    arrangements with partners that offer benefits to cardholders.


 


    Most financial institutions that offer demand deposit accounts
    also issue debit cards to permit depositors to access their
    funds. Use of debit cards for
    point-of-sale
    purchases has grown as most financial institutions have replaced
    ATM cards with general-purpose debit cards bearing either the
    Visa or MasterCard logo. As a result, the purchase volume and
    number of transactions made with debit cards in the United
    States has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card
    transactions. Debit cards were marketed as replacements for cash
    and checks, and transactions made with debit cards have
    typically been for smaller dollar amounts. There is no credit
    extended when a debit card is used and the consumer must have
    sufficient funds in his or her demand deposit account to pay for
    the purchase at the time of the transaction as opposed to charge
    cards where payment is due at the end of the billing period or
    credit cards where payment can be extended over a period of
    time. However, debit cards are also perceived as an alternative
    to credit or charge cards and used in that manner. We do not
    offer a debit card linked to a deposit account, but we do issue
    various types of prepaid cards. As the payments industry
    continues to evolve, we are also facing increasing competition
    from non-traditional players, such as online networks, telecom
    providers, or software-as-a-service providers that leverage new
    technologies and customers’ existing charge and credit card
    accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other
    fee-based solutions. In addition, the evolution of payment
    products in emerging markets may





    
    23



Table of Contents





    be different than it has been in developed markets. Instead of
    migrating from cash to checks to plastic, technology and
    consumer behaviors in these markets may result in the skipping
    of one or more steps to alternative payment mechanisms such as
    mobile payments. For a further discussion of the evolving
    competitive landscape in the payments industry, please see
    “Global Network & Merchant
    Services—Competition” beginning on page 13
    above.


 


    The principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing
    business include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    features and the quality of the services, including rewards
    programs, provided to Cardmembers




 



     
        • 

    
    the number, spending characteristics and credit performance of
    Cardmembers




 



     
        • 

    
    the quantity, diversity, and quality of the establishments that
    accept Cards




 



     
        • 

    
    the cost of Cards to Cardmembers




 



     
        • 

    
    pricing, payment and other Card account terms and conditions




 



     
        • 

    
    the number and quality of other payment cards and other forms of
    payment available to Cardmembers




 



     
        • 

    
    the nature and quality of expense management data capture and
    reporting capability




 



     
        • 

    
    the success of targeted marketing and promotional campaigns




 



     
        • 

    
    reputation and brand recognition




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability of issuers to manage credit and interest rate risk
    throughout the economic cycle




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability of issuers to implement operational and cost
    efficiencies




 



     
        • 

    
    the quality of customer service.





 



    Financing
    Activities


 


    The Company meets its financing needs through a variety of
    sources, including cash or assets that are readily convertible
    into cash, direct and third-party distributed deposits,
    unsecured medium- and long-term notes, asset securitizations,
    securitized borrowings through a conduit facility and long-term
    committed bank borrowing facilities in certain
    non-U.S. markets.


 


    American Express Credit Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary
    of TRS, along with its subsidiaries (“Credco”),
    acquires or finances the majority of charge Card receivables
    arising from the use of corporate Cards issued in the United
    States and consumer and corporate Cards issued in certain
    currencies outside the United States. Credco funds the
    acquisition or financing of receivables principally through the
    sale of medium- and long-term notes. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB
    finance their revolving credit receivables and consumer and
    small business charge card receivables, in part, through the
    sale of medium-term notes and by offering consumer deposits in
    the United States. TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB also fund
    receivables through asset securitization programs. The cost of
    funding Cardmember receivables and loans is a major expense of
    Card operations.


 


    (You can find a discussion of our securitization and other
    financing activities on pages 41-44 under the caption
    “Financial Review,” and Note 7 on
    pages 85-87 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders,
    which portions we incorporate herein by reference.) In addition,
    please see “Difficult conditions in the global capital
    markets and economy generally, as well as political conditions
    in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely
    affect our business and results of operations” and
    “Adverse capital and credit market conditions may
    significantly affect the Company’s ability to meet
    liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital”
    in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” below.


 



    Deposit
    Programs


 


    Our banking subsidiaries offer deposits to individuals through
    third-party brokerage networks as well as directly to consumers.
    As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $29.7 billion in total consumer





    
    24



Table of Contents





    deposits. The majority of the Company’s outstanding
    U.S. retail deposits have been raised through third-party
    channels. As part of its funding strategy, a majority of the
    deposits raised during 2010 were sourced directly by the Company
    with consumers through Personal Savings from American Express.
    Our deposit-taking activities compete with other deposit-taking
    organizations that source deposits through telephone, internet
    and other electronic delivery channels, brokerage networks,
    and/or
    through branch locations. We compete primarily in the deposit
    sectors on the basis of rates and our brand reputation for
    safety and service. We seek to obtain the deposits of new
    customers as well as existing card customers by offering
    attractive rates and marketing our name brand.


 


    Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive
    interest rates on deposits also is dependent on capital levels
    of our bank subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act
    (“FDIA”) generally prohibits a bank, including our
    banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered deposits or
    offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher
    than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally
    (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless
    (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately
    capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is
    less than well capitalized generally may not pay an interest
    rate on any deposit, including
    direct-to-consumer
    deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national
    rate published by the FDIC unless the FDIC determines that the
    bank is operating in a high-rate area. An adequately capitalized
    insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll
    over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been
    granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC.
    Undercapitalized depository institutions may not solicit
    deposits by offering interest rates that are significantly
    higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits
    in such institution’s normal market areas or in the market
    area in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted. There
    are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized
    (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance
    provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to
    cease and desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action
    directive issued by its federal regulator). If a depository
    institution’s federal regulator determines that it is in an
    unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in unsafe or unsound
    banking practices, the regulator may reclassify a well
    capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, require an
    adequately capitalized institution to comply with certain
    restrictions as if it were undercapitalized, and require an
    undercapitalized institution to take certain actions applicable
    to significantly undercapitalized institutions, all of which
    would adversely impact its ability to accept brokered deposits.


 



    Card-Issuing
    Business — Regulation


 


    The charge card and consumer lending businesses are subject to
    extensive regulation. In the United States, we are subject to a
    number of federal laws and regulations, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which generally prohibits
    discrimination in the granting and handling of credit)




 



     
        • 

    
    the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), as amended by
    the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACT
    Act”) (which, among other things, regulates use by
    creditors of consumer credit reports and credit prescreening
    practices and requires certain disclosures when an application
    for credit is rejected)




 



     
        • 

    
    the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) (which, among other
    things, requires extensive disclosure of the terms upon which
    credit is granted), including the amendments to TILA that were
    adopted through the enactment of the Fair Credit and Charge Card
    Disclosure Act (which mandates certain disclosures on credit and
    charge card applications)




 



     
        • 

    
    the Fair Credit Billing Act (which, among other things,
    regulates the manner in which billing inquiries are handled and
    specifies certain billing requirements)




 



     
        • 

    
    the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which regulates disclosures
    and settlement of transactions for electronic funds transfers
    including those at ATMs)




 



     
        • 

    
    the CARD Act (which prohibits certain acts and practices in
    connection with consumer credit card accounts)







    
    25



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (Title X of
    Dodd–Frank) (which provides for the creation of the
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new consumer financial
    services regulator)




 



     
        • 

    
    Regulation Z (which was recently amended by the Federal
    Reserve to extensively revise the open end consumer credit
    disclosure requirements and to implement the requirements of the
    CARD Act)




 



     
        • 

    
    federal and state laws and regulations that generally prohibit
    engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices.





 


    Certain federal privacy-related laws and regulations govern the
    collection and use of customer information by financial
    institutions (see “Corporate & Other”
    below). Federal legislation also regulates abusive debt
    collection practices. In addition, a number of states, the
    European Union, and many foreign countries in which we operate
    have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure and
    privacy-related laws (in certain cases more stringent than the
    laws of the United States). Bankruptcy and debtor relief laws
    affect us to the extent that such laws result in amounts owed
    being classified as delinquent
    and/or
    charged off as uncollectible. As stated above, card issuers and
    card networks are subject to certain provisions of the Bank
    Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to
    maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. For a
    discussion of these and other regulations and legislation that
    impact our business, please see “Supervision and
    Regulation — General” within
    “Corporate & Other” below.


 


    American Express Company and its subsidiaries, including in
    particular Centurion Bank, AEBFSB and our other bank entities,
    are subject to a variety of laws and regulations applicable to
    financial institutions. Changes in such laws and regulations or
    in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation thereof
    could impact the manner in which we conduct our business and the
    costs of compliance. The regulatory environment in which our
    Card and lending businesses operate has become increasingly
    complex and robust, and following the financial crisis of 2008,
    supervisory efforts to apply relevant laws, regulations and
    policies have become more intense. The U.S. Congress and
    regulators, as well as various consumer advocacy groups, have
    continued to focus their attention on certain practices of
    credit card issuers, such as unfair and deceptive business
    practices, increases in annual percentage rates
    (“APRs”), changes in the terms of the account, and the
    types and levels of fees and financial charges charged by card
    issuers for, among other things, late payments, returned checks,
    payments by telephone, copies of statements and the like. In
    August 2010, AEBFSB entered into a public, written supervisory
    agreement with the OTS, its primary federal banking regulator,
    requiring AEBFSB to make certain enhancements to its compliance
    program and to complete certain corrective actions relating to
    compliance. We regularly review and, as appropriate, refine our
    business practices in light of existing and anticipated
    developments in laws, regulations and industry trends so we can
    continue to manage our business prudently and consistent with
    regulatory requirements and expectations. For information about
    the recently enacted CARD Act, please see “Privacy, Fair
    Credit Reporting” within “Supervision and
    Regulatory — General” below beginning on
    page 48.


 


    In January 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
    Council (the “FFIEC”), an interagency body composed of
    the principal U.S. federal entities that regulate banks and
    other financial institutions, issued new guidance to the
    industry on credit card account management and loss allowance
    practices (the “Guidance”). The Guidance covers five
    areas: (i) credit line management; (ii) over-limit
    practices; (iii) minimum payment and negative amortization
    practices; (iv) workout and forbearance practices; and
    (v) certain income (fee) recognition and loss allowance
    practices. The Guidance is generally applicable to all
    institutions under the supervision of the federal bank
    regulatory agencies that comprise the FFIEC, although it is
    primarily the result of the identification by bank regulators in
    their examinations of other credit card lenders’ practices
    deemed by them to be inappropriate, particularly, but not
    exclusively, with regard to subprime lending programs. At
    present, we do not have any lending programs that target the
    subprime sector. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB evaluate and discuss
    the Guidance with their respective regulators on an ongoing
    basis as part of their regulatory examination processes, and, as
    a result, may refine their practices from time to time based on
    regulatory input. The Guidance has not had, nor do we expect it
    to have, any material impact on our businesses or practices.

    American
    Express Consumer Travel Network — USA


 


    The American Express Consumer Travel Network — USA
    provides travel, financial and Cardmember services to consumers
    through American Express-owned travel service offices, call
    centers, participating American Express Representatives
    (independently owned travel agency locations that operate under
    the American Express brand) and the Consumer Travel Web site.
    U.S. Consumer Travel has distinguished itself in the luxury
    segment through its Platinum Travel Services and Centurion
    Travel Services, which service the needs of our premium
    Cardmembers and support the exclusive travel benefits that we
    provide for them. These exclusive travel benefits include the
    International Airline Program, which offers international first-
    and or business-class companion tickets on one of 22 world class
    airlines, and the Fine Hotels & Resorts program, which
    is a luxury hotel program offering room upgrades and value-added
    amenities.


 


    During 2010, we also introduced new travel benefits for Platinum
    and Centurion Cardmembers, an American Express mobile
    application to keep travelers informed with flight alerts and an
    airport lounge locator. Other premium programs developed by
    Consumer Travel for
    Centurion®

    Card and Platinum
    Card®

    members include the Cruise Privileges Program, Destinations
    Vacations Program and the Private Jet Services Program. Consumer
    Travel also provides other value-added programs such as Gold
    Card Destinations, a collection of travel benefits exclusively
    for Gold Card members, and Destination
    Family®,

    a set of valuable benefits and offers across cruise, tour,
    hotel, and car rental designed for American Express Card members
    traveling with families. In addition, the Consumer Travel
    business operates a wholesale travel business in the United
    States through our Travel Impressions subsidiary. (A wholesaler
    secures allotments, such as hotel rooms, from suppliers and then
    offers the services to customers at retail prices that the
    wholesaler determines.) Our wholesale travel business manages
    and operates American
    Express®

    Vacations, sold exclusively through the American Express
    Consumer Travel Network in the United States and our Membership
    Travel Services International Group internationally. Travel
    Impressions also distributes travel packages through other
    retail travel agents and private label brands for third parties
    in the United States. Travel Impressions is consistently
    recognized by its customers for outstanding services, including
    being named Travel Weekly’s “Best Tour
    Operator, Sales and Service,” for six years in a row.


 


    Our Consumer Travel Web site, americanexpress.com/travel, offers
    a full range of travel rates and discounts on airfares, hotels,
    car rentals, last-minute deals, cruises and full vacation
    packages. The Web site offers unique American Express Cardmember
    benefits such as an American Express Travel Office locator,
    Travel Specialist finder tools, double Membership
    Rewards®

    points, and travel planning resources and destination content.
    In addition, Cardmembers are able to Pay With Points by
    redeeming Membership Rewards points for some categories of
    travel through our Web site, as well as through our call centers
    and Travel Offices.


 


    In January 2010, we launched americanexpressfhr.com, allowing
    Platinum Cardmembers to book Fine Hotels & Resorts
    online for the first time. The web site provides details on the
    700+ hotels in the program, including hotel overviews, photos,
    room type descriptions, dining and service information, and any
    special offer details. This site offers our Cardmembers another
    option for booking luxury travel with American Express. In 2010,
    Consumer Travel launched a new ad campaign, “Left
    Behind,” highlighting the unique benefits we offer our
    cardmembers and what they miss out on when they don’t book
    travel through our Consumer Travel Network. In addition, our
    lodging marketing initiatives focused on the lowest rate
    guarantee for all hotel bookings made through Consumer
    Travel’s online site.


 



    American
    Express Consumer Travel Network — USA —
    Competition


 


    Consumer Travel competes with a variety of different competitors
    including traditional “brick and mortar” travel
    agents, credit card issuers offering products with significant
    travel benefits, online travel agents and travel suppliers that
    distribute their products to consumers directly via the Internet
    or telephone-based customer service centers. In recent years we
    have experienced an increasing presence of “niche”
    players that are seeking to capitalize on the growth in the
    luxury travel segment by combining luxury travel offers with
    concierge-type services.

    INTERNATIONAL
    CARD SERVICES


 


    We issue our charge and credit Cards in numerous countries
    around the globe. Our geographic scope is widespread and we
    focus primarily on those countries that we believe offer us the
    greatest financial opportunity. For a discussion of Cards issued
    internationally through our GNS partner relationships, please
    see the section “Global Network Services” above.


 


    The Company continued to bolster its international proprietary
    Card business through the launch of numerous new or enhanced
    Card products during 2010. These are Cards that we issue, either
    on our own or as co-brands with partnering institutions. As we
    have renewed many of our co-brand and financial institution
    deals, we have been focused on adding new products, new
    channels, and increasingly, new markets to the agreements. This
    past year, among other new proprietary products, we announced or
    launched several new co-branded products in the International
    Consumer Business, including: a new Platinum co-brand card in
    partnership with Air New Zealand, New Zealand’s national
    air carrier; a co-brand Card program with Sol Melia, a luxury
    hotel and resort chain based in Spain; and the new Starwood
    Preferred Guest credit card from American Express in the United
    Kingdom and Canada, offering cardmembers and Starwood Preferred
    Guests program loyalists the opportunity to earn Starpoints on
    virtually all of their card spending. We offer many of the same
    programs and services in our international proprietary
    Card-issuing business as we do in our U.S. proprietary
    issuing business. For example, as in the United States, we offer
    various flexible payment options similar to our Sign &
    Travel®

    program and our Extended Payment Option to Cardmembers in
    several countries outside the U.S. Also, as in the United
    States, we issue Cards internationally under distribution
    agreements with financial services institutions. Another example
    of our distribution partnerships is affinity cards with
    fraternal, professional, educational and other organizations.
    For instance, we have been successful in penetrating the
    affinity card segment in Australia, where we issue Cards with
    the majority of the largest professional associations in that
    country. In Australia, affinity cards are a substantial part of
    our total revolving portfolio and contribute to our proprietary
    consumer lending activities.


 


    As in the United States, the Membership Rewards programs are a
    strong driver of Cardmember spending in the international
    consumer business. We have more than 1,500 redemption partners
    across our international business, with an average of
    approximately 84 partners in each country; approximately 30% of
    these partners are in the travel industry. Cardmembers can
    redeem their points with more than 40 airlines and over 175
    hotels. Our redemption options include travel, retail
    merchandise, entertainment, shopping and recreation gift
    certificates, experiences, financial services and charity
    rewards. In 2010, we continued to enhance our rewards programs
    in several countries, offering more flexible choices that enable
    Cardmembers to redeem Membership Rewards points more quickly.


 


    We continue to build on the Company’s strengths and look
    for further opportunities to increase our presence
    internationally. In December 2010, we announced that we entered
    into an agreement to acquire Loyalty Partner, a leading
    marketing services company known for the loyalty programs it
    operates in Germany, Poland and India. Loyalty Partner also
    provides analytics, operating platforms and consulting services
    that help merchants grow their businesses. The acquisition will
    deepen our merchant relationships in select countries, add more
    than 34 million consumers to the company’s
    international customer base and expand its range of rewards and
    loyalty marketing services. The acquisition is part of the
    Company’s drive to build and diversify its fee service
    revenues and expand its international presence. The purchase,
    which has received regulatory approval, is expected to close in
    the first quarter of 2011. The transaction, which values the
    company at $660 million (subject to currency movement and
    other adjustments), consists of an upfront cash purchase price
    of $566 million and an additional $94 million equity
    interest that the Company will acquire over the next five years
    at a value based on business performance.


 


    Membership Travel Services International provides premium travel
    and concierge services to our Platinum and Centurion Customers,
    through 24 exclusively dedicated call centers in 23
    international countries. Additionally, Membership Travel
    Services operates 16 proprietary Travel Service Offices in
    Mexico, Italy and Argentina to provide all Cardmembers with
    travel and general card service assistance. We also provide to
    our cardmembers certain foreign exchange, travelers cheque
    services and other cardmember-related services in Travel Service
    Offices in Mexico, Argentina and Italy. We have taken steps to
    enhance our capabilities to sell





    
    28



Table of Contents





    exclusively negotiated benefits and luxury travel packages with
    preferred suppliers through the Fine Hotels & Resorts
    Program, American Express Vacations and American Express’
    International Airline Program. Our International Airline
    Program, which is exclusively available to Platinum Card and
    Centurion Cardmembers, allows these Cardmembers to receive
    complimentary companion tickets or a class upgrade when flying
    on qualifying international flights in business or first class.


 


    We expanded the flexibility of payment for travel and concierge
    services by allowing International Consumer Cardmembers to use
    their Membership Rewards points to pay for their travel
    purchases in 15 countries outside the U.S.


 



    International
    Proprietary Consumer Card — Competition


 


    Compared to the United States, consumers outside the United
    States use general-purpose charge and credit cards for a smaller
    percentage of their total payments, with some large emerging
    market countries just beginning to transition to card usage in
    any meaningful way. Although our geographic scope is widespread,
    we generally do not have significant share in the countries in
    which we operate internationally. Our proprietary Card-issuing
    business is subject to competition from multinational banks,
    such as Citibank, HSBC and Banco Santander, as well as many
    local banks and financial institutions. Globally, we view
    Citibank and Banco Santander as our strongest competitors, as
    they currently offer card products in a large number of
    countries.


 



    International
    Proprietary Consumer Card — Regulation


 


    As discussed elsewhere in this
    Form 10-K,
    regulators in 2010 continued to propose and enact a variety of
    regulatory changes to the payments landscape in many of our key
    countries. We expect this activity to continue in 2011.
    Regulators continue to consider developments in the United
    States and other jurisdictions to help inform their policy.
    While the nature of the proposals varies, regulators in a number
    of countries have been focused on pricing, disclosure,
    responsible lending and other card practices and we expect this
    to continue in 2011. For example, in the United Kingdom the
    government adopted a new policy by way of a “white
    paper” setting out several requirements around card
    practices. In the European Economic Area, member states have
    implemented or are in the process of implementing European
    Directive 2008/48/EC on credit agreements for consumers
    (commonly referred to as the Consumer Credit Directive), which
    in some countries will have impacts on charge cards in addition
    to credit cards. Member states have also implemented the Payment
    Services Directive, which regulates the conduct of business of
    payment service providers, including card issuers.


 


    As a consequence, these and perhaps other regulators may
    consider and implement additional card practice regulation in
    2011. We continue to evaluate our business planning in light of
    changing market circumstances and the evolving political,
    economic, regulatory and media environment.



 



    GLOBAL
    COMMERCIAL SERVICES


 


    In our Global Commercial Services (“GCS”) segment, we
    provide expense management services to companies and
    organizations worldwide through Global Commercial Card and
    Global Business Travel Services. American Express is a leading
    global issuer of commercial cards and is also a leading global
    travel management company for businesses. During 2010, we added
    or retained several major Commercial Card clients in the United
    States and internationally, including Eaton, GlaxoSmithKline,
    Pfizer, Eastman Kodak, PPG, Xerox, Oracle, and McDonalds.
    Additionally, in 2010, we added or retained several American
    Express Business Travel clients in the United States and
    internationally, including: HCSC (Health Care Services); AXA
    Canada LTD.; University of Nottingham; FIS; Automatic Data
    Processing Inc.; Motorola Mobility; and Symantec Corporation.

    Global
    Commercial Card


 


    Global Commercial Card (“GCC”) offers a range of
    expense management solutions to companies worldwide through our
    Corporate Card Programs and our
    Business-to-Business
    Payment Solutions.


 



    Corporate
    Card Programs


 


    The American
    Express®

    Corporate Card is a charge card that individuals may obtain
    through a corporate account established by their employer for
    business purposes. Through our Corporate Card Program, companies
    can manage their T&E spending and everyday business
    expenses and improve negotiating leverage with suppliers, among
    other benefits. We use our direct relationships with merchants
    to offer Corporate Card clients superior data about company
    spending, as well as streamlined dispute resolution. We issue
    local currency Corporate Cards in 44 countries and international
    dollar/euro Corporate Cards in 108 countries. We also offer
    Corporate Cards issued through our GNS partner relationships in
    an additional 30 countries. In 2010, we introduced international
    dollar/euro Corporate Cards in an additional 24 countries and
    launched a ruble-based Business Travel Account to Russian
    customers, the first product of its kind in Russian currency.


 


    With the heightened focus on cost containment, many companies
    increasingly are interested in our Corporate Meeting Card
    program, which helps businesses control meeting-related
    expenses. It allows clients to capture meeting spending,
    simplify the payment process, and gain access to data to support
    negotiations with suppliers.


 


    American Express also partners with many other companies around
    the world to offer a number of co-brand Corporate Cards in
    various countries. These products, typically suited for
    mid-sized companies, provide savings on everyday business
    spending
    and/or air
    travel. To date, American Express has 15 Corporate Card co-brand
    partnerships worldwide. In 2010, we added the American
    Express®

    Cathay Pacific Corporate Card, the first co-branded airline
    corporate card in Hong Kong. We also continued to enhance our
    existing co-brand portfolios through the launch of the American
    Express® / Business

    ExtrAA®

    Corporate Platinum Card in the United States in 2010.

    Business-to-Business
    Payment Solutions


 


    We also offer a series of
    Business-to-Business
    Payment Solutions to help companies manage B2B spending. This
    type of spending by companies helps to diversify our spend mix.
    These solutions provide a variety of benefits to companies,
    including cost savings, process efficiency, improved cash flow
    and increased visibility, and control and security over business
    expenses. The Corporate Purchasing Card helps large corporations
    and mid-sized companies manage their everyday spending. It is
    used to pay for everyday goods and business expenses, such as
    office supplies, industrial supplies and business equipment in
    27 countries around the world.


 


    vPayment, which offers companies single-use virtual account
    numbers, allows GCC customers to make payments with enhanced
    controls, data capture and reconciliation capabilities. Charges
    are authorized for a specified amount during a specified amount
    of time. The solution automates reconciliation, eliminates
    manual check requests, interfaces easily with a customer’s
    enterprise resource planning (ERP), procurement and accounts
    payable systems, and can be used at one or more stages of the
    procurement-to-payables
    process.


 


    Buyer Initiated Payments allows American Express to pay B2B
    suppliers electronically on behalf of our clients, permitting
    them to manage payments, extend their own days payable
    outstanding (or “float”), and increase their cash on
    hand. Buyer Initiated Payments is currently available to
    companies in the United States and will be offered to companies
    in Canada in 2011. This solution is best suited for mid- to
    large-sized companies that want to transition rapidly to
    electronic payments, reduce supplier inquiries, convert from
    paper to electronic payments, and optimize cash flow. In 2010,
    American Express and SAP AG announced an effort to develop an
    integrated corporate payments solution for joint GCC and SAP
    customers in the United States. The solution will integrate
    SAP’s software solutions into American Express’ Buyer
    Initiated Payments platform to enable
    “plug-and-play”
    functionality when integrating Buyer Initiated Payments into the
    client’s Enterprise Resource Planning system, thereby
    reducing the roadblocks that often delay or deter companies from
    adopting electronic payments.


 



    Mid-sized
    Companies


 


    In addition to providing Corporate Card Programs and our
    Business-to-Business
    Payment Solutions to large and global organizations, GCC markets
    its products and services to mid-sized companies (defined in the
    United States as firms with annual revenues of $10 million
    to $1 billion worldwide). GCC is focused on continuing to
    expand its business with mid-sized companies, which represent
    significant growth opportunities. Businesses of this size often
    do not have a corporate card program. However, once enrolled,
    mid-sized companies typically put a significant portion of their
    business spending on the Corporate Card because they can gain
    control, savings and employee benefits.


 


    In 2010, together with our partner, Concur Technologies Inc., we
    launched Concur Breeze in the United States, a cost-effective
    and
    easy-to-manage
    online expense reporting service for mid-sized clients that
    automates and streamlines the submission, review, approval and
    departmental allocation of all business expenses. We also
    launched similar versions of this product targeted to mid-sized
    clients in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany and
    Australia in 2010.


 


    GCC offers the Savings at
    Work®

    Program to mid-sized companies in the United States, as well as
    similar programs globally, which provides companies with cash
    back and/or
    discounted pricing on everyday business products and services,
    such as car rentals, hotels, restaurants and courier services.
    Corporate Cardmembers can also take advantage of our Membership
    Rewards program to earn points that can be redeemed for air
    travel and hotel stays, as well as retail, home, and recreation
    items. Membership Rewards is a powerful tool for encouraging
    Corporate Card usage, leading to greater control and savings.


 



    Online
    Capabilities


 


    GCC offers companies and individual cardmembers the ability to
    manage their Corporate Card Programs on a 24/7 basis through a
    suite of secure web-based online tools. American Express @
    Work®

    provides clients’ authorized users online access to global
    management information to help them gain visibility into their





    
    31

    spending patterns, as well as the ability to make changes to
    their Corporate Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Business Travel
    Account (“BTA”) and Corporate Meeting Card accounts.
    Cardmembers can use the online Manage Your Card Account (MYCA)
    tool to manage their individual Card account.


 



    Global
    Commercial Card—Competition


 


    The commercial payments sector is dynamic and highly
    competitive, with competition increasingly intense at both the
    card network and card issuer levels. At the network level, we
    have experienced increasing competition including intense price
    competition, aggressive expansion into new and emerging
    segments, efforts to transition
    business-to-business
    spend from cash and check to cards and electronic invoicing and
    payment vehicles, and expanding marketing and advertising
    budgets for commercial services. Both Visa and MasterCard
    continue to support card issuers such as U.S. Bank,
    JPMorgan Chase, and Citibank to build and support data
    collection and reporting necessary to satisfy customer
    requirements. Moreover, in the current economic environment, the
    interest in expense management tools is particularly strong, as
    clients aim to capture data, analyze trends and make decisions
    that enhance their cash flow and profitability. Commercial card
    issuers have increasingly acquired technology offerings to
    enhance data capture capabilities and reporting functionality.
    In addition, many issuers attempt to leverage their banking
    relationships and capabilities to secure and retain card
    business. Global servicing, data quality, technological
    functionality and simplicity, customer experience, and price and
    other financial terms are among the key competitive factors in
    the commercial card business.


 



    Global
    Commercial Card—Regulation


 


    The Global Commercial Card business, which engages in the
    extension of commercial credit, is subject to more limited
    regulation than our consumer lending business. In the United
    States, we are subject to certain of the federal and state laws
    applicable to our consumer lending business, including the Equal
    Credit Opportunity Act, the FCRA (as amended by the FACT Act),
    as well laws that generally prohibit engaging in unfair and
    deceptive business practices. (For a discussion of the FACT Act,
    see “Card-Issuing Business — Regulation”.)
    We are also subject to certain state laws that regulate fees and
    charges on our products. Additionally, as a global business, we
    are subject to U.S. state data security and breach
    notification laws and regulations, as well as significant data
    protection laws in the European Union and many foreign countries
    in which we operate. We are also subject to bankruptcy and
    debtor relief laws that can affect our ability to collect
    amounts owed to us. As discussed above, along with the rest of
    our business, we are subject to certain provisions of the Bank
    Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to
    maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. (For a
    discussion of this legislation and its effect on our business,
    see “Supervision and Regulation—General” within
    “Corporate & Other” below.) In some
    countries, regulation of card practices and consumer protection
    legislation may apply to some commercial card relationships.


 



    Global
    Business Travel


 


    American Express Global Business Travel (“Global Business
    Travel”) provides globally integrated solutions, both
    online and offline, to help organizations manage and optimize
    their travel investments and service their traveling employees.
    With clients ranging from small businesses to multinational
    corporations, these solutions include travel reservation advice
    and transaction processing through a global network that is
    available 24 hours per day; travel expense management
    policy consultation; meeting management, supplier negotiation
    and consultation; advisory services, management information
    reporting, data analysis and benchmarking; and group and
    incentive travel services.


 


    In 2010, we launched several new programs to support our
    corporate clients. These included the launch of
    aXcentissm

    in key countries globally, which focuses on delivering
    localized, flexible and comprehensive travel management programs
    to small and mid-sized companies with up to $10 million in
    annual travel spending; the entry into a new strategic alliance
    with Concur Technologies Inc., which allows us to offer global
    clients a comprehensive,

    of an online, interactive travel management scorecard to measure
    travel program effectiveness. We continue to evaluate our
    economic model and invest in new products, services and
    technologies to enhance the value that we deliver to our
    customers and address

    ongoing travel industry challenges and opportunities. For
    example, we have substantially reduced our reliance on
    commission revenues from suppliers (such as airlines or hotels),
    and now generate revenues primarily from customers who pay for
    the services that we provide.


 


    These services include solutions designed to provide our clients
    with savings, control, services and traveler care. For example,
    we offer customers savings and benefits through the Preferred
    Extrasm

    supplier value programs and advisory services, which provide
    preferred supplier rates and consulting solutions in all areas
    of T&E expense management. We also provide comprehensive
    travel expenses insights through global data with our
    aXis@work®

    solution, which provides real time global data through a single
    on-line interface, enabling clients to gain real time visibility
    into their spending patterns and make real time adjustments to
    their programs and policies for maximum bottom line benefit.


 


    In 2010, we further developed our comprehensive cost-saving
    travel management offerings, including products such as
    mobileXtend, a mobile travel solution that provides travelers
    with various support services. Global Business Travel has moved
    many of its business processes and customer servicing online. In
    the United States, approximately 57.5% of all Global Business
    Travel transactions continue to be processed online. In
    addition, the volume of online transactions is growing in other
    countries around the world.


 



    Global
    Business Travel — Competition


 


    Global Business Travel continues to face intense competition in
    the United States and internationally from numerous traditional
    and online travel management companies, as well as from direct
    sales by airlines and other travel suppliers. Competition among
    travel management companies is mainly based on price, service,
    value creation, convenience, global capabilities and proximity
    to the customer. Competition also comes from corporate customers
    themselves, as some companies have become accredited as in-house
    corporate travel agents. New entrants could also represent
    additional competition along the end to end travel value chain,
    which could impact competition in the medium to long term.


 


    For many years, travel management companies have faced pressure
    on revenues from airlines, as most carriers have stopped paying
    “base” commissions to travel agents for tickets sold
    and significantly reduced other forms of travel agent
    compensation. Carriers have also increased the number of
    transactions they book directly through their Web sites and
    other means. These trends have reduced the revenue opportunities
    for travel management companies because they do not receive
    distribution revenue from directly booked transactions. In
    recent years, the airline industry has undergone bankruptcies,
    restructurings, consolidations and other similar events
    including expanded grants of antitrust immunity to airline
    alliances. This immunity enables airlines to closely coordinate
    their international operations and to launch highly integrated
    joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets. These types
    of structural changes may result in additional challenges to
    travel management companies. For additional information
    concerning these issues, please see “Risk
    Factors — We have agreements with business partners
    in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that
    represent a significant portion of our business” on
    page 87 below.


 


    Overall, intense competition among travel management companies,
    the ongoing trends of increasing direct sales by airlines, the
    rise of low-cost carriers and ongoing reductions in or
    elimination of airline commissions and fees, continue to put
    pressure on revenue and profitability for travel agents.


 


    Over the last few years we have evolved our business model to
    permit us to charge customers for the services we provide and
    the value we create, and restructured our expense base through
    the rationalization of our call center locations and the
    transitioning of many of our services online. We continue to
    look for new ways to enhance the value we deliver for our
    customers both online and offline. Additionally, we are focusing
    on developing new and innovative products, services and
    technologies, which enhance the value we deliver to our
    customers and suppliers and address ongoing travel industry
    challenges and opportunities.


 



    Global
    Business Travel — Regulation


 


    The Global Business Travel business is subject to domestic and
    international laws applicable to the provision of travel
    services, including licensure requirements, as well as laws and
    regulations regarding





    
    33



Table of Contents





    passenger screening and registration such as the Secure Flight
    Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security
    Administration. Additionally, we are subject to U.S. state
    data security and breach notification laws and regulations, as
    well as significant data protection laws in the European Union
    and many foreign countries in which we operate. We are also
    subject to bankruptcy and debtor relief laws that can affect our
    ability to collect amounts owed to us.



 



    CORPORATE &
    OTHER


 


    Corporate & Other consists of corporate functions and
    auxiliary businesses, including the Company’s Enterprise
    Growth Group, the Company’s publishing business, as well as
    other company operations. We also discuss information relevant
    to the Company as a whole in this section.


 



    Enterprise
    Growth Group


 


    The Enterprise Growth Group was established to create a digital
    services platform for the company, to expand alternative mobile
    and online payment services, form new partnerships and build new
    revenue streams beyond the traditional card and travel
    businesses. The Enterprise Growth Group will leverage the assets
    and capabilities that exist today and build or acquire the
    talent, businesses and platforms required to deliver new forms
    of growth in the digital world. The Group consists of four core
    business units: Online and Mobile Payments, Emerging Markets,
    Fee Based Services and Global Payment Options (formerly known as
    Global Prepaid).


 


    The Enterprise Growth Group also includes Serve Virtual
    Enterprises, Inc. or “Serve” (formerly known as
    Revolution Money). Since acquiring Serve about a year ago, we
    have been working to transition it from a separate business unit
    into an enterprise wide platform to support future digital
    initiatives. In early 2011, we plan to launch this next
    generation payment platform, rebranded and retooled, as a first
    step toward delivering more alternative payment options,
    including
    peer-to-peer
    payments, mobile capabilities, prepaid products, virtual
    currencies and international remittances.


 



    Online
    and Mobile Payments


 


    The Online and Mobile business unit is responsible for
    developing new online and mobile payment capabilities that can
    expand the role we play in the digital world. The team is
    focused on working with the right partners to roll out easy to
    use digital payment solutions for consumers, businesses and
    sellers.


 



    Emerging
    Markets


 


    The Emerging Markets team is responsible for expanding our
    presence in countries like India and China by embracing new
    online and mobile payment technologies and introducing payment
    forms, such as prepaid, that fall outside of our core charge and
    credit cards. This business unit is focused on growing our
    businesses organically, as well as identifying acquisition
    targets and strategic partnerships that can significantly
    increase international revenues.


 



    Fee Based
    Services


 


    The Fee Based Services team within the Enterprise Growth Group,
    as well as our existing businesses, is tasked with identifying
    ways to capitalize on the existing assets of American Express by
    creating business models that can generate new, non-payment
    revenue streams. The Fee Based Services team is responsible for
    supporting our LoyaltyEdge offering, a new business line that
    assists partners, like Delta Airlines, with developing,
    operating, and improving their own loyalty programs.


 



    Global
    Payment Options (formerly known as Global Prepaid)


 


    Global Payment Options (“GPO”) offers a wide range of
    prepaid products across the globe, including the American
    Express®

    Gift Card, available in over 100,000 locations in the
    U.S. and Canada. Sales of gift cards





    
    34



Table of Contents





    continued to rise in 2010, reflecting the growing popularity of
    these products and our efforts to increase buying convenience
    for customers.


 


    GPO also offers a variety of incentive prepaid cards, such as
    prepaid rebate and reward card products, as well as prepaid
    reloadable cards. In May, we launched PASS from American
    Express®,

    a prepaid reloadable card, which is sold and marketed to parents
    as a payment tool for teens and young adults that is an
    alternative to cash, credit or debit cards. In addition we
    launched a prepaid travel card in Australia in August and Brazil
    in December.


 


    In addition, we have been in the business of issuing and selling
    travelers cheques since 1891. We sell the American
    Express®

    Travelers Cheque (“Travelers Cheque” or
    “Cheque”) as a safe and convenient alternative to
    cash. Travelers Cheques are currently available in
    U.S. dollars and four foreign currencies, including Euros.
    We also issue and sell other forms of paper travelers cheques,
    including American
    Express®

    Gift Cheques (“Gift Cheques”), which are available in
    U.S. and Canadian dollars. Sales of Travelers Cheques
    continued to decline in 2010.


 


    During 2010 we formed a strategic partnership with the Bank of
    China to launch the American Express Chinese Yuan Travelers
    Cheques, the world’s first Yuan prepaid travel product and
    available for international travelers visiting China from
    certain key countries around the world.


 


    We sell American Express prepaid products through a variety of
    channels, including sales directly to customers via phone and
    the Internet. Travelers Cheques and Gift Cheques are sold
    primarily through a broad network of selling outlets worldwide,
    including American Express travel offices, limited independent
    agents and third-party financial institutions. Gift cards are
    available at americanexpress.com, in most malls and retail
    locations and in many bank branches.


 


    The Global Foreign Exchange Services division (“GFES”)
    of GPO consists of retail and wholesale foreign exchange
    services and FX International Payments (“FXIP”). Other
    than in Australia and Singapore, where we operate foreign
    exchange offices in city locations and through selected partner
    locations, we concentrate our retail foreign exchange business
    in key international airports, for example at London Heathrow in
    the United Kingdom, Barajas Madrid in Spain and Changi Airport
    in Singapore. For corporate clients, our FXIP online product
    allows companies and financial institutions to make cross-border
    payments in major foreign currencies at competitive exchange
    rates.


 


    For fiscal periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2010,
    the results of operations of GFES were included within the GCS
    reportable operating segment. Effective January 1, 2011,
    the results of operations of GFES will be reported as part of
    GPO within the Corporate & Other Segment. This
    organizational change is part of the Company’s strategy to
    accelerate the growth of foreign-exchange related activities in
    new payment areas.


 



    Global
    Payment Options — Competition


 


    Our products compete with a wide variety of financial payment
    products including cash, foreign currency, checks, other brands
    of travelers cheques, debit, prepaid and ATM cards, store
    branded gift cards, other network branded cards and other
    payment cards.


 


    The principal competitive factors affecting the prepaid sector
    are:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the number and location of merchants willing to accept the form
    of payment




 



     
        • 

    
    the availability to the consumer of other forms of payment




 



     
        • 

    
    the amount of fees charged to the consumer




 



     
        • 

    
    the compensation paid to, and frequency of settlement by,
    selling outlets




 



     
        • 

    
    the accessibility of sales and refunds for the products




 



     
        • 

    
    the success of marketing and promotional campaigns




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability to service the customer satisfactorily, including
    for lost or stolen instruments.

    Global
    Payment Options — Regulation


 


    As an issuer of travelers cheques and prepaid cards and a
    provider of foreign exchange services, we are regulated in the
    United States under the “money transmitter” or
    “sale of check” laws in effect in most states. These
    laws require travelers cheque (and, where applicable, prepaid
    card) issuers, as well as providers of foreign exchange
    services, to obtain licenses, to meet certain safety and
    soundness criteria, to hold outstanding proceeds of sale in
    highly rated and secure investments, and to provide detailed
    reports. We invest the proceeds from sales of our Travelers
    Cheques and prepaid cards in accordance with applicable law,
    predominantly in highly rated debt securities consisting
    primarily of intermediate- and long-term federal, state and
    municipal obligations. Many states examine licensees annually.


 


    In addition, federal anti-money laundering regulations require,
    among other things, the registration of traveler cheque issuers
    and the providers of foreign exchange services as “Money
    Service Businesses” and compliance with applicable
    anti-money laundering recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
    Outside the United States, there are varying licensing and
    anti-money laundering requirements, including some that are
    similar to those in the United States.


 


    Travelers cheque issuers are required by the laws of many states
    to comply with state unclaimed and abandoned property laws under
    which such issuers must pay to states the face amount of any
    travelers cheque that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period
    of time, usually 15 years. The abandoned property laws of
    numerous states also apply to prepaid cards in a variety of ways.


 


    In May 2009, the CARD Act amended provisions of the Electronic
    Funds Transfer Act to impose new restrictions on the terms of
    gift cards and certain other prepaid cards, including
    restrictions on the fees that may be charged, expiration dates,
    and consumer disclosures. The Federal Reserve issued final
    regulations to implement the CARD Act gift card provisions that
    became effective in August 2010. Congress thereafter passed
    legislation that extended the August 2010 effective date of the
    CARD Act gift card provisions to January 2011 for gift cards
    produced prior to April 1, 2010, provided certain
    conditions are met. We continue to monitor state legislative
    activity restricting the terms of gift cards. In certain states
    where regulation continues to restrict fees and has made it
    unprofitable for us to offer gift cards, we have limited or
    withdrawn from selling these cards.


 


    In June 2010, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an
    enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
    issued a notice of proposed rule making that proposes a
    number of changes to its regulation of the prepaid industry. In
    general, the proposed rule redefines the term “stored
    value” more broadly and renames this group of products
    “prepaid access.” The three traditional categories of
    stored value participants, “issuers, sellers and redeemers
    of stored value,” are now consolidated into two groups,
    “providers and sellers of prepaid access.” With
    limited exceptions, the proposed rule imposes suspicious
    activity reporting, customer identification, and record keeping
    requirements on the two newly defined groups, which could mean
    non-bank program managers and retailers would have to develop
    and maintain AML programs that were not previously required. The
    public comment period for the proposed rule closed on
    August 27, 2010. We are awaiting issuance of the final rule
    and will analyze its impact on our current products once the
    final rule is issued.


 


    Please see “Global Network & Merchant
    Services — Regulation” on page 14 for a
    discussion of the Federal Reserve’s proposed rules under
    Dodd-Frank to establish, among other things, interchange fee
    limitation rules for debit or prepaid gift card transactions,
    and to prohibit exclusive network routing restrictions for
    electronic debit transactions (which applies to all prepaid
    cards).

    tlgolf.com, tlfamily.com and eskyguide.com. We have an agreement
    with Time Inc. under which it manages our publishing business,
    and we share profits relating to this business.


 



    The
    Global Services Group


 


    The Global Services Group (“Global Services”) was
    created to heighten the company’s focus on customer service
    and to ensure all business operations are managed as effectively
    and efficiently as possible. We have organized support functions
    by process rather than business unit, which the Company expects
    will streamline costs, reduce duplication of work, better
    integrate skills and expertise, and improve customer service.


 


    Global Services is comprised principally of the following
    divisions:


 



    World
    Service


 


    Our U.S. and international service organizations have been
    consolidated under World Service. Our customer service units
    have worked over a number of years to ensure outstanding service
    to customers, while at the same time improving operating
    margins. As mentioned earlier in this Report, J.D. Power
    and Associates released its annual nationwide credit card
    satisfaction study and ranked American Express highest in
    overall satisfaction among 10 of the largest card issuers in the
    United States for the fourth consecutive year.


 



    Global
    Business Services


 


    The Global Business Services division is principally comprised
    of procurement, real estate, human resources processing and
    financial processing. These internal process-driven activities
    have been consolidated to simplify and standardize processes for
    increased quality, efficiency and cost savings.


 



    Global
    Credit Administration


 


    Global Credit Administration (“GCA”) is responsible
    for the
    end-to-end
    management of our credit, collections, and fraud operations
    around the world. GCA aims to strike the right balance between
    helping Cardmembers in need through a range of workout programs,
    and taking actions to prevent spending that will not be paid
    back to American Express.


 



    Technologies


 


    We continue to make significant investments, both in the United
    States and internationally, in our Card systems and
    infrastructure to allow faster introduction and greater
    customization of products. We also are using technology to
    develop and improve our service capabilities to continue to
    deliver a high quality customer experience. For example, we
    maintain a service delivery platform that our employees use in
    the Card business to support a variety of customer servicing and
    account management activities such as account maintenance,
    updating of Cardmember information, the addition of new Cards to
    an account and resolving customer satisfaction issues. In
    international markets, we are enhancing our global platforms and
    capabilities, such as in revolving credit.


 


    We continue to leverage the Internet to lower costs, improve
    service quality and enhance our business model. During 2010, we
    continued to broaden our focus to use the Internet to drive
    revenue and build our brand, while continuing to migrate
    transaction volumes at lower costs. We also continue to have
    more online customer service interactions in the United States
    than we do by telephone or in person.


 


    As of year-end, customers had enrolled approximately
    30 million Cards globally in our online account management
    capability known as the “Manage Your Card Account”
    service. This service enables Cardmembers to review all of their
    card transactions online, pay their American Express bills
    electronically, view and service their Membership Rewards
    program accounts and conduct various other functions quickly and
    securely online. We now have an online presence in 24 countries
    around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia,
    Italy, France, Mexico and Japan. We continue to devote
    substantial resources to our technology

    platform to ensure the highest level of data integrity, security
    and privacy. We are one of the founders of PCI SSC, an
    independent standards-setting organization that manages the
    evolution of technical data security standards. We also are an
    owner-member of EMVCo, the standards body that manages,
    maintains, and enhances specifications for chip-based payment
    cards and acceptance devices, including
    point-of-sale
    terminals. (For a discussion of these organizations, see the
    “Global Merchant Services” section above.)


 


    We have outsourced most of our technology infrastructure
    management and application development and maintenance to third
    party service providers to enable us to benefit from their
    expertise while lowering our information technology costs per
    transaction. However, our internal IT organization continues to
    retain the Company’s key technology competencies, including
    information technology strategy, information security, managing
    strategic relationships with technologies’ partners, data
    center operations, technology architecture and engineering,
    oversight of application and database development and
    maintenance, and managing the technology portfolios of our
    businesses.



 



    Supervision
    and Regulation — General


 



    Overview


 


    Federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies
    extensively regulate the Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and
    AEBFSB, including prescribing standards relating to capital,
    earnings, liquidity, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of
    shares, loans or extension of credit to affiliates and insiders,
    internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems,
    loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth and
    impaired assets, among other things. Such laws and regulations
    are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, other
    customers and the federal deposit insurance funds, as well as to
    minimize systemic risk, and not for the protection of our
    shareholders or creditors. Following the financial crisis of
    2008, supervisory efforts to apply these laws, regulations and
    policies have become more intense.


 


    American Express Company and TRS are bank holding companies
    under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”)
    and have elected to be treated as financial holding companies
    under the BHC Act. As a bank holding company under the BHC Act,
    the Company is subject to supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve. Under the system of “functional
    regulation” established under the BHC Act, the Federal
    Reserve supervises the Company, including all of its non-bank
    subsidiaries, as an “umbrella regulator” of the
    consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary
    U.S. regulators of the Company’s U.S. depository
    institution subsidiaries, as applicable. Bank regulatory
    agencies have broad examination and enforcement power over bank
    holding companies and their subsidiaries, including the power to
    impose substantial fines, limit dividends, restrict operations
    and acquisitions and require divestitures. Bank holding
    companies and banks, as well as subsidiaries of both, are
    prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant
    regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound.


 


    Many aspects of our business are also subject to rigorous
    regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory
    agencies and securities exchanges and by
    non-U.S. government
    agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Certain
    of our public disclosure, internal control environment and
    corporate governance principles are subject to the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and
    related regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock
    Exchange, Inc. As a global financial institution, to the extent
    that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or
    inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we
    face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts.


 



    The
    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
    Act


 


    Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly
    restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United
    States, including through the creation of a new systemic risk
    oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
    (“FSOC”). The FSOC will oversee and coordinate the
    efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies
    (including the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the U.S. Commodity
    Futures Trading Commission, the OCC and the FDIC) in
    establishing regulations to address financial stability
    concerns. Dodd-Frank directs the FSOC to make recommendations to
    the Federal Reserve as to supervisory requirements and
    prudential standards applicable to bank holding companies with
    $50 billion or more in total consolidated





    
    38



Table of Contents





    assets, which includes the Company, and other systemically
    important financial institutions. The standards include capital,
    leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements. Dodd-Frank
    mandates that the requirements applicable to systemically
    important financial institutions be more stringent than those
    applicable to other financial companies.


 


    In addition to the framework for systemic risk oversight
    implemented through the FSOC, Dodd-Frank broadly affects the
    financial services industry in numerous respects, including by
    creating a resolution authority, by requiring banks to pay
    increased fees to regulatory agencies, by requiring all publicly
    traded bank holding companies that have assets of at least
    $10 billion to establish a risk committee (including
    independent directors) responsible for enterprise-wide risk
    management oversight and practices, and through numerous other
    provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the
    financial services sector. Moreover, Title X of Dodd-Frank,
    known as the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (the
    “CFPA”), provides for the creation of the Consumer
    Financial Protection Bureau, a new consumer financial services
    regulator, discussed below under “Consumer Financial
    Protection Act of 2010.” New laws or regulations or changes
    to existing laws and regulations (including changes in
    interpretation or enforcement) could materially adversely affect
    our financial condition or results of operations. As discussed
    further throughout this section, many aspects of Dodd-Frank are
    subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several
    years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial
    impact on the Company or across the industry. In addition to the
    discussion in this section, please see “Risk
    Factors — The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
    Consumer Protection Act may have a significant adverse impact on
    our business, results of operations and financial
    condition” on pages 77-78 and “Risk
    Factors — Banks, card issuers and card network
    operators generally are the subject of increasing global
    regulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens
    on our Company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and
    revenues through our network” on pages 80-82 for a
    further discussion of some of the potential impact legislative
    and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and
    financial condition.


 



    Consumer
    Financial Protection Act of 2010


 


    As mentioned above, the CFPA provides for the creation of the
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “Bureau”), a
    new consumer financial services regulator. As of July 21,
    2011, but subject to a possible six-month extension, our
    marketing and sale of consumer financial products and our
    compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws,
    including the CFPA and the Truth in Lending Act, will be
    supervised and examined by the Bureau. On that date, the Bureau
    will assume responsibility from our current banking regulators
    for supervision and examination of Centurion Bank, AEBFSB, and
    their affiliates, including the Company, with respect to such
    federal consumer financial laws. The Bureau will have authority
    to take enforcement actions against us for violation of those
    laws and also will have exclusive rulemaking authority for such
    federal consumer financial laws. In the interim, the federal
    banking agencies have been vigorously enforcing consumer
    protection laws.


 


    The Bureau also will be directed to prohibit “unfair,
    deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and to ensure that
    all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial
    products and services, and that such markets are fair,
    transparent and competitive. The new legislation also weakens
    federal preemption available to federal savings associations,
    including AEBFSB, and gives state attorneys general the ability
    to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.


 



    Financial
    Holding Company Status and Activities


 


    The BHC Act limits the nonbanking activities of bank holding
    companies. Unless a bank holding company has qualified as a
    “financial holding company,” its nonbanking activities
    are restricted to those that the Federal Reserve has determined
    are “so closely related to banking as to be a proper
    incident thereto.” An eligible bank holding company may
    elect to be a financial holding company, which is authorized to
    engage in a broader range of financial activities. A financial
    holding company may engage in any activity that has been
    determined by rule or order to be financial in nature,
    incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior Federal
    Reserve approval) complementary to a financial activity and that
    does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of a
    depository institution or to the financial system generally.

    engages in various activities permissible only for a bank
    holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial
    holding company, including in particular providing travel agency
    services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance
    underwriting and agency services.


 


    For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding
    company status, each of its subsidiary U.S. depository
    institutions must be “well capitalized” and “well
    managed” and must have received at least a satisfactory
    rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
    (the “CRA”) review. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, beginning
    July 21, 2011, but subject to a possible six-month
    extension, to be eligible for financial holding company status,
    the Company and TRS also must be and remain well capitalized and
    well managed. If the Company fails to continue to meet
    applicable capital or managerial standards for financial holding
    company status, the Company would be required to enter into an
    agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with applicable
    capital and managerial standards. Moreover, until all relevant
    conditions are satisfied, the Company, its subsidiaries and
    affiliates would not, without the Federal Reserve’s prior
    approval, be permitted to commence any additional activities, or
    acquire control or shares of any company, in reliance on the
    Company’s status as a financial holding company, and the
    Company would be required to comply with any additional
    limitations that the Federal Reserve imposes. If a company does
    not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal
    Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary
    U.S. depository institutions or the company may discontinue
    or divest investments in companies engaged in activities
    permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to
    be treated as a financial holding company. In addition, if any
    subsidiary U.S. depository institution fails to maintain a
    satisfactory rating under the CRA, American Express would be
    subject to substantially the same restrictions on activities and
    acquisitions as set forth above.

    extensive government regulation and supervision which could

    condition” in “Item 1A—Risk
    Factors” below.


 



    Heightened
    Prudential Requirements for Large Bank Holding
    Companies


 


    As discussed above, Dodd-Frank creates a new systemic risk
    oversight body, the FSOC, to identify, monitor and address
    potential threats to U.S. financial stability.
    Additionally, Dodd-Frank imposes heightened prudential
    requirements on bank holding companies with at least
    $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the
    Company, and requires the Federal Reserve to establish
    prudential standards for such large bank holding companies that
    are more stringent than those applicable to other bank holding
    companies, including standards for risk-based capital
    requirements and leverage limits, liquidity, risk-management
    requirements, resolution plans (referred to as “living
    wills”), credit exposure reporting, and concentration. The
    Federal Reserve has discretionary authority to establish
    additional prudential standards, on its own or at the
    FSOC’s recommendation, regarding contingent capital,
    enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and
    otherwise as it deems appropriate.


 


    Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to conduct annual
    analyses of bank holding companies with at least
    $50 billion in total consolidated assets to evaluate
    whether the companies have sufficient capital on a total
    consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses as a result of
    adverse economic conditions. In addition, such large bank
    holding companies, including the Company, must conduct similar
    so-called “stress tests” on a semiannual basis.
    Furthermore, such large bank holding companies may be required
    to maintain a
    debt-to-equity
    ratio of no more than 15 to 1 upon a determination by the FSOC
    that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability
    of the U.S. and the imposition of such requirement is
    necessary to mitigate the posed threat.


 


    As noted above, Dodd-Frank will require us to prepare and
    provide to regulators a resolution plan that must, among other
    things, ensure that our depository institution subsidiaries are
    adequately protected from risks arising from our other
    subsidiaries. The establishment and maintenance of this
    resolution plan may, as a practical matter, present additional
    constraints on transactions and business arrangements between
    our bank and non-bank subsidiaries.

    Activities
    and Acquisitions


 


    The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior
    approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) it may acquire
    direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of
    any bank or savings and loan association, if after such
    acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or
    indirectly own or control more than 5% of any class of the
    voting securities of the institution; (2) it or any of its
    subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or
    substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan
    association; or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any
    other bank holding company.


 


    The Federal Reserve must approve certain additional capital
    contributions to an existing
    non-U.S. investment
    and certain direct and indirect acquisitions by the Company of
    an interest in a
    non-U.S. company,
    including in a foreign bank, as well as the establishment by
    Centurion Bank of foreign branches in certain circumstances.
    Additionally, a provision of Dodd-Frank that became effective on
    the day of enactment requires bank holding companies with total
    consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to
    provide the Federal Reserve with written notice prior to
    acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting
    shares of any company (other than an insured depository
    institution) that is engaged in financial activities described
    in section 4(k) of the BHC Act and that has total
    consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, subject to
    certain exceptions. Moreover, another provision of Dodd-Frank
    that is effective on the transfer date of July 21, 2011,
    but subject to a possible six-month extension, requires
    financial holding companies to obtain Federal Reserve approval
    prior to acquiring a nonbank company with total consolidated
    assets in excess of $10 billion.


 


    The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity, or
    group of persons or entities acting in concert, from acquiring
    “control” of a bank holding company such as the
    Company unless the Federal Reserve has been given prior notice
    and has not objected to the transaction. Under Federal Reserve
    regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting
    stock of the Company would generally create a rebuttable
    presumption of acquisition of control of the Company.


 


    In addition, under the BHC Act, any company is required to
    obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring
    control of the Company, which, among other things, includes the
    acquisition of ownership of or control over 25% or more of any
    class of voting securities of the Company or the power to
    exercise a “controlling influence” over the Company.
    In the case of an acquirer that is a bank or bank holding
    company, the BHC Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve
    for the acquisition of ownership or control of any voting
    securities of the Company, if the acquisition results in the
    bank or bank holding company controlling more than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the
    Company.


 



    Source of
    Strength


 


    Federal Reserve policy historically has required bank holding
    companies to act as a source of strength to their bank
    subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to
    support those subsidiaries. Dodd-Frank makes this a statutory
    requirement and extends it to all insured depository institution
    subsidiaries beginning on July 21, 2011, subject to a
    possible six-month extension. Therefore, the Company is expected
    to act as a source of strength to Centurion Bank and AEBFSB and
    to commit capital and financial resources to support both
    institutions. Such support may be required at times when, absent
    this requirement, we otherwise might determine not to
    provide it.


 


    Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary
    banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to
    certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the
    event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any
    commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank
    regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be
    assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
    payment.


 



    Capital
    Adequacy


 


    The Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required to
    comply with the applicable capital adequacy guidelines
    established by the federal banking regulators. There are two
    risk-based measures of





    
    41



Table of Contents





    capital adequacy for bank holding companies that have been
    promulgated by the Federal Reserve, as well as a leverage
    measure.


 


    The Company currently calculates its risk-based capital ratios
    under guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve, based on the
    1998 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee
    on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). In
    June 2004, the Basel Committee published new international
    guidelines for determining regulatory capital (“Basel
    II”). In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory
    agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on Basel II. The
    Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required to transition to
    the Basel II based guidelines no later than January 1,
    2013, unless extended by its regulators. In December 2010, the
    Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening
    international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially
    identified by the Basel Committee as “Basel III”.
    Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. banking agencies
    and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and
    their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital,
    with a greater emphasis on common equity. Each Basel Accord is
    discussed below.


 


    The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make
    regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in
    credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial
    holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet exposure,
    and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets
    and off-balance-sheet items are assigned to broad risk
    categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital
    ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted
    assets and off-balance-sheet items. As a supervisory matter,
    federal bank regulatory agencies expect most bank holding
    companies, and in particular larger bank holding companies such
    as the Company, to maintain regulatory capital ratios that, at a
    minimum, qualify a bank holding company and its depository
    institution subsidiaries as “well capitalized.” The
    required ratios to qualify as well capitalized are a total
    risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a leverage ratio of
    at least 5%. The guidelines also provide that bank holding
    companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions
    will be expected to maintain strong capital positions
    substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without
    significant reliance on intangible assets. Following the recent
    financial crisis, the federal bank regulatory agencies have
    encouraged larger bank holding companies to maintain capital
    ratios appreciably above the “well capitalized”
    standard. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is focusing more on the
    regulatory requirement that common equity be the
    “predominant” element of Tier 1 capital.
    Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will
    consider a “tangible Tier 1 capital leverage
    ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of
    capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
    activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has assessed the
    capital adequacy of the country’s 19 largest bank holding
    companies, including the Company, under a so-called “stress
    test”.


 


    For additional information regarding our capital ratios, please
    see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” on
    pages 39-41 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders,
    which information is incorporated herein by reference.


 



    Basel
    I


 


    The Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB currently calculate
    regulatory capital ratios under Basel I, as adopted by the
    applicable federal bank regulatory agencies. Under Basel I,
    as adopted, the minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital
    to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet
    items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half
    of the total capital must be composed of Tier 1 capital,
    which includes common equity, undivided profits, minority
    interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries
    (including, for bank holding companies but not banks, trust
    preferred securities), non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock
    and for bank holding companies (but not banks) a limited amount
    of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and
    certain other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist
    of, among other things, qualifying subordinated debt,
    mandatorily convertible debt securities, other preferred stock
    and trust preferred securities and a limited amount of the
    allowance for loan losses. Non-cumulative perpetual preferred
    stock, trust preferred securities and other so-called
    “restricted core capital elements” are generally
    limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital. The minimum guideline for
    the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 4%.

Table of Contents





    The risk-based capital rules state that the capital guidelines
    are minimum standards based primarily on broad credit-risk
    considerations and do not take into account the other types of
    risk a banking organization may be exposed to (e.g., interest
    rate, market, liquidity and operational risks). The Federal
    Reserve may, therefore, set higher capital requirements for
    categories of banks (e.g., systematically important firms), or
    for an individual bank, as situations warrant.


 



    Basel
    II


 


    The U.S. Basel II final rule became effective on
    April 1, 2008. The Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are
    required to transition to the Basel II-based guidelines by
    January 1, 2013,unless extended by its regulators. The
    final rule provides for a series of three transitional periods
    during which the Company must calculate its risk-based capital
    ratios under both the Basel I-based guidelines and the new Basel
    II-based guidelines, with the minimum capital requirements
    during the transitional periods being the greater of the
    required capital as calculated under the final rule and a
    designated percentage of required capital as calculated under
    Basel I. Prior to beginning the three transitional periods, we
    must complete a satisfactory parallel-run period of no less than
    four consecutive calendar quarters during which we will be
    required to confidentially report regulatory capital under both
    the Basel I and Basel II regulations. Under the final rule,
    we must begin the first transitional period for capital
    calculation under the final rule no later than January 1,
    2013, unless this time is extended by the Federal Reserve.


 


    Dodd-Frank appears to require the Federal Reserve to adopt
    regulations imposing a continuing “floor” of the Basel
    I-based capital guidelines in cases where the Basel II-based
    capital requirements and any changes in capital regulations
    resulting from Basel III otherwise would permit lower
    requirements. In December 2010, the Federal Reserve published
    for comment proposed regulations implementing this requirement.


 



    Leverage
    Requirement


 


    Basel I and Basel II do not include a leverage requirement
    as an international standard. However, the Federal Reserve has
    established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding
    companies (and, as further discussed below, Basel III will
    impose a leverage requirement as an international standard). The
    Federal Reserve’s existing guidelines provide for a minimum
    ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, less
    goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the “Leverage
    Ratio”), of 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain
    specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory
    rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required
    to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at least 4%.


 



    Basel
    III


 


    The Basel III final capital framework, among other things:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    introduces as a new capital measure “Common Equity
    Tier 1”, or “CET1”, specifies that
    Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional
    Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified
    requirements, defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most
    adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and
    not to the other components of capital, and expands the scope of
    the adjustments as compared to existing regulations;




 



     
        • 

    
    when fully phased in on Jan. 1, 2019, requires banks to
    maintain:





 




    
    
    



     
        – 

    
    as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of
    CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%
    “capital conservation buffer”, which is added to the
    4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively
    resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of
    at least 7% (there is no comparable CET1 requirement under Basel
    I or II)




 



     
        – 

    
    a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
    of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, which is
    added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is
    phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1
    capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation (the current
    requirement is 6.00% for a well capitalized bank)







    
    43



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        – 

    
    a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus
    Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least
    8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, which is added to
    the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in,
    effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%
    upon full implementation (the current requirement is 10% for a
    well capitalized bank) and




 



     
        – 

    
    as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage
    ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to
    balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures
    (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the
    quarter) and





 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer”,
    generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that
    excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup
    of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital
    conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully
    implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between
    2.5% and 5%).





 


    The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses
    during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a
    ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but
    below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital
    conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the
    latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity
    repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the
    shortfall.


 


    The implementation of the Basel III final framework will
    commence January 1, 2013. On that date, banking
    institutions will be required to meet the following minimum
    capital ratios:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    3.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;




 



     
        • 

    
    4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and




 



     
        • 

    
    8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.





 


    The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new
    deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for
    example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights,
    deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and
    significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities
    be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category
    exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate
    exceed 15% of CET1. The amount of these assets that is not
    deducted from CET1 will be risk weighted at 250%.


 


    Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1
    will begin on January 1, 2014 and will be phased-in over a
    five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the
    capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016
    at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing
    by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it
    reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).


 


    The U.S. banking agencies have indicated informally that
    they expect to propose regulations implementing Basel III
    in mid-2011 with final adoption of implementing regulations in
    mid-2012. Notwithstanding its release of the Basel III
    framework as a final framework, the Basel Committee is
    considering further amendments to Basel III, including the
    imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally
    systemically important financial institutions. The Company does
    not believe it will be considered a globally systemically
    important financial institution. Dodd-Frank requires the federal
    banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting
    U.S. banking institutions’ capital requirements in a
    number of respects and mandates that the Federal Reserve adopt
    prudential requirements applicable to systemically important
    financial institutions (including risk-based capital and
    leverage requirements) that are more stringent than those
    applicable to other financial companies. The Company is a bank
    holding company with more than $50 billion in total
    consolidated assets, so it is considered a systemically
    important financial institution under Dodd-Frank. The
    implications of this designation on the Company’s capital
    requirements are uncertain at this time. Accordingly, the
    regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially
    different from the Basel III final framework as published
    in December 2010.

    Liquidity
    Ratios under Basel III


 


    Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding
    company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter,
    both in the U.S. and internationally, without required
    formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires
    banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity
    against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some
    respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and
    regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going
    forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as
    the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to
    ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of
    unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the
    entity’s expected net cash outflow for a
    30-day time
    horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow)
    under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test,
    referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”),
    is designed to promote more medium-and long-term funding of the
    assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time
    horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to
    increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and
    other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the
    use of long-term debt as a funding source. The LCR would be
    implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011,
    but would not be introduced as a requirement until
    January 1, 2015, and the NSFR would not be introduced as a
    requirement until January 1, 2018. These new standards are
    subject to further rulemaking and their terms may change before
    implementation.


 



    Prompt
    Corrective Action


 


    The FDIA requires, among other things, that federal banking
    regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of
    FDIC-insured depository institutions (such as Centurion Bank and
    AEBFSB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA
    specifies five capital tiers: “well capitalized,”
    “adequately capitalized,”
    “undercapitalized,” “significantly
    undercapitalized,” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital
    tier depends upon how its capital levels compare to various
    relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as
    established by regulation. A bank may be deemed to be in a
    capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its
    actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory
    examination rating. Once an institution becomes
    “undercapitalized,” the FDIA imposes progressively
    more restrictive constraints on operations, management and
    capital distributions, depending on the capital category in
    which an institution is classified. A depository institution
    that is not well capitalized is also subject to restrictions on
    the acceptance of brokered deposits including Certificate of
    Deposit Account Registry Service deposits. The majority of the
    Company’s outstanding U.S. retail deposits have been
    raised through third-party channels and are considered brokered
    deposits for bank regulatory purposes. As part of its funding
    strategy, a majority of the deposits raised during 2010 were
    sourced directly by the Company with consumers through Personal
    Savings from American Express. For a description of our deposit
    programs, please see “Deposit Programs” beginning on
    page 24 above and “Deposit Programs” on
    page 43 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which
    information is incorporated herein by reference.


 


    The FDIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository
    institution from making any capital distribution (including
    payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its
    holding company if the depository institution would thereafter
    be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions
    are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal
    Reserve and to growth limitations, and are required to submit a
    capital restoration plan. For a capital restoration plan to be
    acceptable, any holding company must guarantee the capital plan
    up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository
    institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized
    and the amount of the capital deficiency at the time it fails to
    comply with the plan. In the event of the holding company’s
    bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over claims of
    its general unsecured creditors. If a depository institution
    fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is
    significantly undercapitalized.


 


    Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be
    subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including
    orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately
    capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation
    of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically
    undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
    appointment of a receiver or conservator.

    Dividends


 


    The Company and TRS as well as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are
    limited by banking statutes and regulations in their ability to
    pay dividends. In general, federal and applicable state banking
    laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval,
    insured depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and
    AEBFSB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions
    are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause the
    institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In
    addition to specific limitations on the dividends that
    subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal
    regulators could prohibit a dividend that would constitute an
    unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial
    condition of the banking organization.


 


    Dividend payments by the Company and TRS to shareholders are
    subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. It is Federal
    Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay
    dividends on common stock to common shareholders only out of net
    income available to common shareholders over the past year and
    only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears
    consistent with the organization’s current and expected
    future capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial
    condition. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain
    dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of
    depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the
    bank holding company’s ability to be a source of strength
    to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve could prohibit
    a dividend by the Company or TRS that would constitute an unsafe
    or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition
    of the banking organization.


 


    Under “temporary” guidance issued by the Federal
    Reserve in November 2010, bank holding companies, such as the
    Company and TRS, should consult with the Federal Reserve before
    taking any actions that could result in a diminished capital
    base, including actions such as increasing dividends. The
    Federal Reserve will assess the bank holding company’s
    capital adequacy based on capital plans and stress tests
    submitted by the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve will
    review the capital plans, including dividend policies, against,
    among other things, the bank holding company’s ability to
    achieve Basel III capital ratio requirements referred to
    above as they are phased in by U.S. regulators and any
    potential impact of Dodd-Frank on the company’s risk
    profile, business strategy, corporate structure or capital
    adequacy. A company that has not achieved Basel III capital
    requirements on a fully phased-in basis may have difficulty
    increasing dividends. Although the regulations ultimately
    applicable to the Company will be determined by the Federal
    Reserve, the Company estimates that, had regulations
    implementing Basel III been in place during the fourth
    quarter of 2010, the Company’s capital ratios under
    Basel III would have exceeded the minimum requirements.
    This estimate could change in the future. Although we expect to
    meet the Basel III capital requirements, inclusive of the
    capital conservation buffer, as phased in by the Federal
    Reserve, the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be
    substantially different from the Basel III final framework
    as published in December 2010.


 



    Transactions
    between Centurion Bank or AEBFSB and Their Respective
    Affiliates


 


    Certain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) between Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, on
    the one hand, and their affiliates (including the Company, TRS
    and their non-bank subsidiaries), on the other hand, are subject
    to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral
    requirements, and other restrictions imposed by statute and
    Federal Reserve regulation. Effective July 21, 2012
    (subject to a six-month extension) Dodd-Frank significantly
    expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate
    transactions within a banking organization and changes the
    procedure for seeking exemptions from these restrictions.
    Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally
    required to be made on an arms-length basis. These restrictions
    generally do not apply to transactions between a depository
    institution and its subsidiaries.


 



    FDIC
    Insurance Assessments


 


    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB accept deposits, and those deposits
    are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. The
    FDIC’s deposit insurance fund (“Deposit Insurance
    Fund”) is funded by assessments on insured depository
    institutions, which currently depend on the risk category of an
    institution and the amount of





    
    46



Table of Contents





    insured deposits that the institution holds. The FDIC may
    increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a
    semi-annual basis.


 


    As part of its efforts to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund,
    the FDIC required insured depository institutions, including
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, to prepay their estimated assessments
    for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on December 30, 2009.


 


    Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to base
    insurance assessments on the average consolidated total assets
    less the average tangible equity of the insured depository
    institution during the assessment period (the “new
    assessment base”). The FDIC has approved a final rule,
    effective April 1, 2011, that implements the required
    change to the assessment base and changes the assessment rate
    calculation for large insured depository institutions, including
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB. Effective April 1, 2011, the
    assessment rates will be subject to adjustments based upon the
    insured depository institution’s ratio of
    (1) long-term unsecured debt to the new assessment base,
    (2) long-term unsecured debt issued by another insured
    depository institution to the new assessment base, and
    (3) brokered deposits to the new assessment base. However,
    effective April 1, 2011, the adjustments based on brokered
    deposits to the new assessment base will not apply so long as
    the institution is well capitalized and has a composite CAMELS
    rating of 1 or 2. Additionally, the rules permit the FDIC to
    impose additional discretionary assessment rate adjustments.
    These changes could have an adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition. Furthermore, future changes
    to deposit insurance assessments also could have an adverse
    effect on our results of operation and financial condition.


 


    Dodd-Frank also requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio
    for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15 percent to reach a
    minimum of 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits by
    September 30, 2020. On December 20, 2010, the FDIC
    issued a final rule setting the increased reserve ratio at
    2 percent. This increase will result in increased costs for
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB. In addition, Dodd-Frank eliminates
    the ceiling (1.5 percent of insured deposits) on the size
    of the Deposit Insurance Fund and makes the payment of dividends
    from the Deposit Insurance Fund by the FDIC discretionary.


 


    Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an
    institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution
    has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
    unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any
    applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by
    the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation
    that might lead to termination of deposit insurance at either of
    our insured depository institution subsidiaries.


 



    FDIC
    Powers upon Insolvency of Insured Depository
    Institutions


 


    If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an
    insured depository institution, such as Centurion Bank or
    AEBFSB, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC
    has the power: (1) to transfer any of the depository
    institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor
    without the approval of the depository institution’s
    creditors; (2) to enforce the terms of the depository
    institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms; or
    (3) to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to
    which the depository institution is a party, the performance of
    which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the
    disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC
    to promote the orderly administration of the depository
    institution.


 


    In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of
    U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for
    administrative expenses against an insured depository
    institution would be afforded a priority over other general
    unsecured claims against the institution, including claims of
    debt holders of the institution and depositors in
    non-U.S. offices,
    in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by a
    receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to
    repudiate any debt obligations of Centurion Bank or AEBFSB, the
    debt holders would be treated differently from, and could
    receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in
    U.S. offices of the depository institution.

    Orderly
    Liquidation Authority under Dodd-Frank


 


    Dodd-Frank creates Orderly Liquidation Authority
    (“OLA”), a resolution regime for systemically
    important non-bank financial companies, including bank holding
    companies, under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the
    FDIC as receiver to liquidate such a company if the company is
    in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to
    U.S. financial stability. This determination by the
    Treasury Secretary must come after supermajority recommendations
    by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and consultation by the
    Treasury Secretary with the President. OLA is similar to the
    FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, with certain
    modifications to reflect differences between depository
    institutions and non-bank financial companies and to reduce
    disparities between the treatment of creditors’ claims
    under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an OLA proceeding as
    compared to disparities that would exist in the resolution by
    the FDIC of an insured depository institution.


 


    An Orderly Liquidation Fund will fund OLA liquidation
    proceedings through borrowings from the U.S. Department of
    Treasury and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities
    that receive more in the resolution than they would have
    received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and
    second, if necessary, on bank holding companies with total
    consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as the
    Company, and on certain other non-bank financial companies. If
    an orderly liquidation is triggered, the Company could face
    assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. It is not possible
    to determine the level of any such future assessments.


 



    Cross-Guarantee
    Provisions


 


    Under the “cross-guarantee” provision of the Financial
    Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
    (“FIRREA”), insured depository institutions, such as
    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, may be liable to the FDIC with
    respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be
    incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC
    assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository
    institution. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are commonly controlled
    within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.


 



    Community
    Reinvestment Act


 


    Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to the provisions of the
    CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the primary federal regulator
    of a depository institution is required, in connection with its
    examination of the depository institution, to assess such
    depository institution’s record in meeting the credit needs
    of the communities served by that depository institution,
    including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore,
    such assessment also is required of any depository institution
    that has applied to, among other things, merge or consolidate
    with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a
    federally regulated financial institution or to open or relocate
    a branch office. In the case of a bank holding company applying
    for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding company, the
    Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary
    depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in
    considering the application. In addition, as discussed
    previously, the failure of the Company’s subsidiary
    depository institutions to maintain satisfactory CRA ratings
    could result in restrictions on the Company’s and TRS’
    ability to engage in activities in reliance on financial holding
    company authority.


 



    Privacy,
    Fair Credit Reporting


 


    We use information about our customers to develop and make
    available relevant, personalized products and services.
    Customers are given choices about how we use and disclose their
    information, and we give them notice regarding the measures we
    take to safeguard this information. Regulatory activity in the
    areas of privacy and data security continues to increase
    worldwide, spurred by advancements in technology and related
    concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of
    information. Our regulatory examiners, as well as our auditors,
    are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy and data
    security/access control policies and practices are adequate to
    inform our customers of our data uses and to protect their
    personal data.




    
    48



Table of Contents





    As noted above, as part of our efforts to enhance payment
    account data security, in 2006, we and several other payment
    card networks formed the PCI SSC, an independent
    standards-setting organization to manage the evolution of the
    PCI Data Security Standard, which helps organizations that
    process card payments to prevent credit/charge card security
    breaches and fraud through increased controls around data and
    its exposure to compromise.


 


    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) became effective
    on July 1, 2001. The GLBA requires consumer notice of a
    financial institution’s privacy policies and practices and
    affords customers the right to “opt out” of the
    institution’s disclosure of their personal financial
    information to nonaffiliated third parties (with limited
    exceptions). This legislation does not preempt state laws that
    afford greater privacy protections to consumers, and several
    states have adopted such legislation. For example, in 2003
    California enacted that state’s Financial Information
    Privacy Act, which requires (with limited exceptions)
    “opt-in” consent from customers before their data may
    be disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties.


 


    In addition, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as
    many as 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico
    and the Virgin Islands, have enacted security breach laws and
    regulations, requiring varying levels of consumer notification
    in the event of a data security breach. Data breach laws are
    also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where
    we operate, including Japan, Mexico and Germany. In many
    countries that have yet to impose automatic data breach
    notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the
    threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection
    authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage
    data breaches.


 


    Beyond these data breach laws, we are subject to the GLBA’s
    requirements to safeguard customer information, and to a growing
    number of state laws (including in Massachusetts and Nevada)
    that impose broad-ranging data security obligations regarding
    the protection of customer and employee data. In 1995, the
    European Parliament and Council passed European Directive
    95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the
    processing of personal data and on the free movement of such
    data (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive),
    which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal
    data to, among other things, take the necessary technical and
    organizational steps to protect personal data. Compliance with
    these various laws could result in higher technology,
    administrative and other costs for the Company. In July 2010, we
    submitted for review by relevant European data protection
    authorities our draft binding corporate rules for processing of
    data within the American Express group which, once approved,
    will enable a more efficient basis on which to transfer data
    within our group. The European Commission is currently assessing
    the need for further changes to the European Union’s data
    protection regime.


 


    We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in
    accordance with applicable law and our internal data protection
    policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for
    identity theft or other fraud, while seeking to collect and use
    data properly to achieve our business objectives. We also have
    undertaken measures to assess the level of access to customer
    data by our employees and our partners and service providers,
    and to ensure that such access is limited to the least
    privileged level necessary to perform their job or function for
    the Company.


 


    The FCRA regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by
    consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer credit
    report information by banks and other companies. Among other
    things, FCRA places restrictions (with limited exceptions) on
    the sharing and use of certain personal financial and
    creditworthiness information of our customers with and by our
    affiliates.


 


    FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in December 2003
    of the FACT Act. The FACT Act requires any company that receives
    information concerning a consumer from an affiliate, subject to
    certain exceptions, to permit the consumer to opt out from
    having that information used to market the company’s
    products to the consumer. In November 2007, the federal banking
    agencies issued a final rule implementing the affiliate
    marketing provisions of the FACT Act. Companies subject to
    oversight by these agencies were required to comply with the
    rules by October 1, 2008. The Company has implemented
    various mechanisms to allow our customers to opt out of
    affiliate sharing and of marketing by the Company and our
    affiliates, and it continues to review and enhance these
    mechanisms to ensure compliance with applicable law and a
    favorable customer experience.

Table of Contents





    The FACT Act further amended the FCRA by adding several new
    provisions designed to prevent or decrease identity theft and to
    improve the accuracy of consumer credit information. The federal
    banking agencies and the Federal Trade Commission
    (“FTC”) published a final rule in November 2007
    requiring financial institutions to implement a program
    containing reasonable policies and procedures to address the
    risk of identity theft and to identify accounts where identity
    theft is more likely to occur. Companies subject to oversight by
    the federal banking agencies originally were required to comply
    with the rule by November 1, 2008, but the FTC suspended
    enforcement of its rule through December 31, 2010 pending
    legislation to clarify the law’s scope. On
    December 18, 2010, the President signed the Red Flag
    Program Clarification Act of 2010 into law. The Company’s
    internal policies and standards, as well as our enterprise-wide
    data security and fraud prevention programs, comply with the new
    identity theft requirements.


 


    The FACT Act also imposes duties on both consumer reporting
    agencies and on businesses that furnish or use information
    contained in consumer credit reports. For example, a furnisher
    of information is required to implement procedures to prevent
    the reporting of any information that it learns is the result of
    identity theft. Also, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of
    information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the
    furnisher of that information must conduct an investigation and
    respond to the consumer in a timely fashion. The federal banking
    regulatory agencies and the FTC have issued rules that specify
    the circumstances under which furnishers of information would be
    required to investigate disputes regarding the accuracy of the
    information provided to a consumer reporting agency. The FACT
    Act also requires grantors of credit that use consumer credit
    report information in making a determination to offer a borrower
    credit on terms that are “materially less favorable”
    than the terms offered to most of the lender’s other
    customers to notify the borrower that the terms are based on a
    consumer credit report. In such a case the borrower is entitled
    to receive a free copy of the report from the consumer reporting
    agency. The federal bank regulatory agencies and the FTC have
    issued rules that specify the circumstances under which
    “risk-based pricing” notices must be provided to
    customers and the content, format and timing of such notices.
    Dodd-Frank will require, effective July 21, 2011, the
    addition of certain information about credit scores to
    “risk-based pricing” notices and to adverse action
    notices otherwise required by the FCRA. Grantors of credit using
    prescreened consumer credit report information in credit
    solicitations are also required to include an enhanced notice to
    consumers that they have the right to opt out from receiving
    further prescreened offers of credit. The enactment of the FACT
    Act and the promulgation of rules implementing it are not
    expected to have a significant impact on our business or
    practices.


 



    The CARD
    Act


 


    In May 2009, the CARD Act was enacted to prohibit certain
    practices for consumer credit card accounts. The CARD Act, among
    other requirements, prohibits issuers from treating a payment as
    late for any purpose, including increasing the APR or imposing a
    fee, unless a consumer has been provided a “reasonable
    amount of time” to make the payment. It also requires
    issuers to apply payment amounts in excess of the minimum
    payment first to the balance with the highest APR and then to
    balances with lower APRs. In addition, the Act prohibits an
    issuer from increasing the APR on outstanding balances, except
    in limited circumstances such as when a promotional rate
    expires, a variable rate adjusts, or an account is seriously
    delinquent or completes a workout arrangement. These
    requirements became effective on February 22, 2010.


 


    The CARD Act also requires issuers to maintain reasonable
    written policies to consider a consumer’s income or assets
    and current obligations prior to opening an account or
    increasing a credit line. This required minor adjustments to our
    account opening decisioning and line increase decisioning
    processes. This requirement became effective on
    February 22, 2010, and to date has not had any significant
    impact on these decisions. In addition, applicants for new
    accounts who are under the age of 21 must demonstrate an
    independent ability to make the required minimum periodic
    payments. On October 19, 2010, the Federal Reserve proposed
    clarifications to its rules implementing the CARD Act, which
    would include a requirement that applicants who are 21 and over
    must also demonstrate an independent ability to make the
    required monthly minimum payments. Issuers would not be
    permitted to consider household income or assets, but only the
    individual income or assets of the applicant. If adopted as
    proposed, this rule may decrease the number of applications for
    our Cards that are approved for applicants who do not have
    sufficient individual income, even





    
    50



Table of Contents





    though their household income may be sufficient for approval.
    Since August 22, 2010, the CARD Act requires that penalty
    fees be reasonable and proportional. While the Company has
    adjusted penalty fees (late fees and returned payment fees)
    accordingly, this requirement is not expected to have any
    significant impact on results of operations.


 


    Also, since August 22, 2010, the CARD Act requires issuers
    to periodically reevaluate APR increases to determine if a
    decrease is appropriate. The first of these reevaluations must
    be completed in February 2011. The obligation to periodically
    reevaluate APR increases is ongoing, and it is uncertain how
    these provisions will be interpreted or amended by the new
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Therefore, while the
    ultimate impact of this requirement is uncertain at this time,
    it could have a significant impact on our results of operations.


 


    The Federal Reserve also amended its rules on the format and
    content of consumer credit card disclosures. The amendments
    required revisions to the format and content of all main types
    of open-end consumer credit disclosures, including applications
    and solicitations, account-opening disclosures, and periodic
    billing statements. These amendments became effective on
    July 1, 2010.


 


    Certain provisions of the CARD Act also apply to stored value
    and prepaid products sold on or after August 22, 2010. In
    March 2010, the Federal Reserve amended its Regulation E to
    impose new restrictions on the ability to impose dormancy,
    inactivity or service fees with respect to gift certificates,
    store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards issued primarily
    for personal use. Such fees may only be imposed under certain
    conditions. Additionally, the rules prohibit the sale or
    issuance of a gift certificate, store gift card or general-use
    prepaid card that has an expiration date of less than five years
    after either the date a certificate or card is issued or the
    date on which funds were last loaded. The rules also require
    implementation of policies and procedures to give consumers a
    reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at
    least five years before the certificate or card expiration date,
    prohibit any fees for replacing an expired certificate or card
    or refunding the remaining balance as long as the underlying
    funds remain valid, and require additional disclosures for any
    fee other than a dormancy, inactivity or service fee.


 


    While the Company has made certain changes to our product terms
    and practices designed to comply with the CARD Act, the
    long-term impact of the CARD Act on the Company’s business
    practices and revenues will depend upon a number of factors,
    including our ability to successfully implement our business
    strategies, consumer behavior and the actions of the
    Company’s competitors, which are difficult to predict at
    this time. If the Company is not able to lessen the impact of
    the changes required by the CARD Act, it will have a material
    adverse effect on results of operations.


 



    Anti-Money
    Laundering Compliance


 


    In the United States, the USA Patriot Act was enacted in October
    2001 in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
    attacks. The Patriot Act, in addition to substantially
    broadening existing AML and terrorist financing legislation,
    amended the Bank Secrecy Act, the primary legislation governing
    AML requirements. The Patriot Act contains a wide variety of
    provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering,
    including provisions aimed at impeding terrorists’ ability
    to access and move funds used in support of terrorist
    activities. Among other things, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended
    by the Patriot Act, requires financial institutions to establish
    AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some
    instances, expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering
    and recordkeeping requirements. While American Express has long
    maintained AML programs in our businesses, certain of our
    business activities are subject to specific AML regulations that
    prescribe minimum standards for components of the AML programs.
    For example, our GNS business maintains a risk-based program to
    ensure that institutions that are licensed to issue cards or
    acquire merchants on their networks maintain adequate AML
    controls. We have also developed and implemented a Know Your
    Customer, or due diligence, program and an enhanced due
    diligence program, including a program for verifying the
    identity of our customers for applicable businesses. We will
    take steps to comply with any additional regulations or
    initiatives that are adopted, whether in the United States or in
    other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

    Over the last several years, the industry has seen increased
    regulatory scrutiny of the AML compliance programs of financial
    institutions, with emphasis on record keeping and reporting
    requirements such as the requirement to identify and report
    suspicious activity, leading to enforcement actions and
    increased penalties for non-compliance. To meet this increased
    scrutiny, we continue to enhance our enterprise-wide AML
    compliance program. Our AML compliance programs primarily
    consist of risk-based policies, procedures and controls that are
    reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report money
    laundering.


 


    We have significant operations in the European Union, including
    a number of regulated businesses. We monitor developments in EU
    legislation, as well as in the other countries in which we
    operate, to ensure that we are in a position to comply with all
    applicable legal requirements, including European Union
    directives applicable to payment institutions, credit providers,
    insurance intermediaries and other financial institutions.


 



    Office of
    Foreign Assets Control Regulation


 


    The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect
    transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and
    others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules,
    and they are administered by the U.S. Department of
    Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
    (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions take many
    different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of
    the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or
    investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions
    against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a
    sanctioned country and prohibitions on
    “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions
    relating to making investments in, or providing
    investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned
    country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the
    government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned
    country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property
    subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the
    possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets
    (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn,
    set off or transferred in any manner without a license from
    OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious
    legal and reputational consequences.


 



    Compensation
    Practices


 


    Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the
    Federal Reserve. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the
    FDIC and the OTS jointly issued final guidance on sound
    incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking
    organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, including bank
    holding companies, such as the Company, as well as all insured
    depository institutions, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB.
    The final guidance sets forth three key principles for incentive
    compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that
    incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive
    risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of
    banking organizations. The three principles provide that a
    banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements
    should provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and
    financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees
    to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, be compatible
    with effective internal controls and risk management, and be
    supported by strong corporate governance, including active and
    effective oversight by the organization’s board of
    directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices of a
    banking institution that are identified by the Federal Reserve
    or other bank regulatory agencies in connection with its review
    of such organization’s compensation practices may be
    incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings,
    which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform
    other actions. The final guidance provides that enforcement
    actions may be taken against a banking organization if its
    incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management
    control or governance processes pose a risk to the
    organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is
    not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the
    deficiencies.


 


    Additionally, on February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a
    notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank on
    incentive-based compensation practices. The proposed rule is a
    joint rulemaking by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the
    OTS, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the
    National Credit Union Administration, which each must
    independently approve the proposed rule before it is published
    for comment. Under the proposed rule, all financial institutions
    with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more (such
    as the Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) would be prohibited
    from offering incentive-based compensation arrangements that
    encourage inappropriate risk taking by offering
    “excessive” compensation or





    
    52



Table of Contents





    compensation that could lead the company to material financial
    loss. All covered institutions would be required to provide
    federal regulators with additional disclosures to determine
    compliance with the proposed rule and also to maintain policies
    and procedures to ensure compliance. Additionally, for covered
    institutions with at least $50 billion in total
    consolidated assets, such as the Company, the proposed rule
    requires that at least 50% of certain executive officers’
    incentive-based compensation be deferred for a minimum of three
    years and provides for the adjustment of deferred payments to
    reflect actual losses or other measures of performance that
    become known during the deferral period. Moreover, the board of
    directors of a covered institution with at least
    $50 billion in total consolidated assets must identify
    employees who have authority to expose an institution to
    substantial risk, evaluate and document the incentive-based
    compensation methods used to balance risk and financial rewards
    for the identified employees, and approve incentive-based
    compensation arrangements for those employees after
    appropriately considering other available methods for balancing
    risk and financial rewards. The form and timing of any final
    rule cannot be determined at this time.


 


    Our compensation practices are affected by Dodd-Frank amendments
    to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”) requiring a non-binding
    “say-on-pay”
    vote to be provided at least once every three years at a
    shareholders’ meeting and a non-binding shareholder vote to
    be provided at least once every six years to determine the
    frequency of
    say-on-pay
    votes. These votes must be provided at meetings of shareholders
    occurring after January 21, 2011. In addition, Dodd-Frank
    requires proxy statement disclosure of compensation arrangements
    requiring payments to named executive officers upon a change in
    control (“golden parachutes”) if shareholders are
    voting on a merger or similar transaction, as well as a separate
    non-binding vote to approve golden parachute compensation
    arrangements that had not previously been subject to a
    say-on-pay
    vote. The golden parachute disclosure and vote is required in
    proxy statements and other schedules and forms initially filed
    on or after April 25, 2011.


 


    The scope and content of these policies and regulations on
    executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely
    to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined
    at this time whether compliance with such policies and
    regulations will adversely affect the ability of American
    Express and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate its
    and their key employees.


 



    Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act


 


    Our international operations are subject to complex
    international and U.S. laws and regulations, including the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and local
    laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments
    to foreign government officials, political parties or political
    party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
    business or an improper advantage. The anti-corruption
    provisions of the FCPA are enforced by DOJ. The FCPA also
    requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and
    internal controls standards enforced by the SEC. In recent
    years, DOJ and SEC enforcement of the FCPA has become more
    intense. Failure to comply with the FCPA and other laws can
    expose us and/or individual employees to potentially severe
    criminal and civil penalties. The risk may be greater when we
    transact business, whether through subsidiaries or joint
    ventures or other partnerships, in countries with higher
    perceived levels of corruption. We have policies and procedures
    designed to detect and deter prohibited practices, provide
    specialized training, monitor our operations and payments
    globally, and investigate allegations of improprieties relating
    to transactions and the manner in which transactions are
    recorded. However, if our employees, contractors or agents fail
    to comply with applicable laws governing our international
    operations, the Company, as well as individual employees, may
    face investigations or prosecutions, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.



 



    FOREIGN
    OPERATIONS


 


    We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the use of
    our Card products, Travelers Cheques, travel and other financial
    products and services in countries outside the United States and
    continue to broaden the use of these products and services
    outside the United States. (For a discussion of our revenue by
    geographic region, see Note 25 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements, which you can find on
    pages 114-116
    of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is
    incorporated herein by reference.)





    
    53



Table of Contents





    Our revenues can be affected by political and economic
    conditions in these countries (including the availability of
    foreign exchange for the payment by the local Card issuer of
    obligations arising out of local Cardmembers’ spending
    outside such country, for the payment of Card bills by
    Cardmembers who are billed in other than their local currency,
    and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers Cheque
    sales). Substantial and sudden devaluation of local
    Cardmembers’ currency can also affect their ability to make
    payments to the local issuer of the Card in connection with
    spending outside the local country.


 


    As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to the
    possibility that, because of foreign exchange rate fluctuations,
    assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar may be realized in amounts greater or less than
    the U.S. dollar amounts at which they are currently
    recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples of
    transactions in which this may occur include the purchase by
    Cardmembers of goods and services in a currency other than the
    currency in which they are billed; the sale in one currency of a
    Travelers Cheque denominated in a second currency; and, in most
    instances, investments in foreign operations. These risks,
    unless properly monitored and managed, could have an adverse
    effect on our operations. For more information on how we manage
    risk relating to foreign exchange, see “Risk
    Management — Market Risk Management Process” on
    pages 48-49
    of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is
    incorporated herein by reference.



 



    SALE OF
    AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. / DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS


 


    On September 18, 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell
    our international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd.
    (“AEBL”), to Standard Chartered PLC (“Standard
    Chartered”), and to sell American Express International
    Deposit Company (“AEIDC”) through a put/call agreement
    to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEBL
    sale. The sale of AEBL was completed on February 29, 2008.
    In the third quarter of 2008, AEIDC qualified to be reported as
    a discontinued operation and the sale of AEIDC was completed on
    September 10, 2009.


 


    For all periods presented, all of the operating results, assets
    and liabilities, and cash flows of AEBL (except for certain
    components of AEBL that were not sold) and AEIDC have been
    removed from the Corporate & Other segment and are
    presented separately in discontinued operations in the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to
    exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.

    GUIDE
    3 — STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING
    COMPANIES


 


    The accompanying supplemental information should be read in
    conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
    Company’s 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which
    information is incorporated herein by reference (“Annual
    Report”). This information excludes discontinued operations
    unless otherwise noted.


 


    Upon adoption of new GAAP governing transfers of financial
    assets and consolidation of variable interest entities
    (“VIEs”), the Company was required to change its
    accounting for the American Express Credit Account Master Trust
    (the “Lending Trust”), a previously unconsolidated
    VIE, which is now consolidated. As a result, beginning
    January 1, 2010, the securitized cardmember loans and
    related debt securities issued to third parties by the Lending
    Trust are included on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. The Company continues to consolidate the American Express
    Issuance Trust (the “Charge Trust”). Prior period
    results have not been revised for the change in accounting for
    the Lending Trust. Refer to Note 1 “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies” on page 72 and
    Note 7 “Asset Securitizations” on page 85 of
    the Annual Report for further discussion.

    (a) 
    
    
    Averages based on month end balances, except reserves for
    cardmember and other receivables/loans, which are based on
    quarter end averages.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    Amounts include (i) average interest-bearing restricted
    cash balances of $1,570 million, $417 million, and
    $214 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which
    are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    and (ii) the associated interest income.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    “Interest bearing deposits in other banks” and
    “cash and due from banks” have been revised for book
    overdraft misclassifications in 2009 and 2008, as described in
    Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies” on page 72 of the Annual Report.



 


    
    (d) 
    
    
    Card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest
    income were $115 million, $107 million, and
    $95 million in U.S. and $105 million, $79 million
    and $51 million in
    non-U.S. for
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



 


    
    (e) 
    
    
    Average non-accrual loans were included in the average loan
    balances used to determine the average yield on loans in amounts
    of $839 million, $554 million and $8 million in
    U.S. as well as $11 million, $15 million and
    $6 million in
    non-U.S. for
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



 


    
    (f) 
    
    
    Average yields for
    available-for-sale
    investment securities have been calculated using total amortized
    cost balances and do not include changes in fair value recorded
    in other comprehensive (loss) income. Average yield on
    non-taxable investment securities is calculated on a
    tax-equivalent basis using the U.S. federal statutory tax rate
    of 35 percent.



 


    
    (g) 
    
    
    Amounts include (i) average equity securities balances,
    which are included in investment securities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated dividend income.
    The average yield on other assets has not been shown as it would
    not be meaningful.



 


    
    (h) 
    
    
    The average yield on total interest-earning assets is adjusted
    for the impacts of items mentioned in (f) above.



 


    
    (i) 
    
    
    Includes premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation.

    (c) 
    
    
    Amounts include (i) average deferred compensation liability
    balances which are included in other liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated
    interest expense. The average rate on other liabilities has not
    been shown as it would not be meaningful.



 


    
    (d) 
    
    
    “Accounts payable” and “other liabilities”
    have been revised for book overdraft misclassifications in 2009
    and 2008, as further described in Note 1 “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies” on page 72 of the
    Annual Report.



 


    
    (e) 
    
    
    Net average yield on interest-earning assets is defined as net
    interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets
    as adjusted for the items mentioned in note (f) on page 58.




 



    CHANGES
    IN NET INTEREST INCOME -VOLUME AND RATE ANALYSIS (a)


 


    The following table presents the amount of changes in interest
    income and interest expense due to changes in both average
    volume and average rate. Major categories of interest-earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities have been segregated
    between U.S. and
    non-U.S. offices.
    Average volume/rate changes have been allocated between the
    average rate and average volume variances on a consistent basis
    based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances
    and average rates.

    (a) 
    
    
    Cardmember loans have no stated maturity and are therefore
    included in the due within one year category. However, many of
    the Company’s cardmembers will revolve their balances,
    which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for
    balances due at December 31, 2010.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    Cardmember receivables are immediately due upon receipt of
    cardmember statements and have no stated interest rate and are
    included within the due within one year category. Receivables
    due after one year represent long-term modification programs or
    Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs), wherein the terms of a
    receivable have been modified for cardmembers that are
    experiencing financial difficulties and a long-term concession
    (more than 12 months) has been granted to the borrower.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    Cardmember and other loans due after one year primarily
    represent installment loans and approximately $166 million
    of TDRs.

    CARDMEMBER
    LOAN AND CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLE CONCENTRATIONS


 


    The following table presents the Company’s exposure to any
    concentration of gross cardmember loans and cardmember
    receivables which exceeds 10 percent of total cardmember
    loans and cardmember receivables. Cardmember loan and cardmember
    receivable concentrations are defined as cardmember loans and
    cardmember receivables due from multiple borrowers engaged in
    similar activities that would cause these borrowers to be
    impacted similarly to certain economic or other related
    conditions.

    Refer to Note 22 “Significant Credit
    Concentrations” on page 110 in the Annual Report for
    additional information on concentrations, including exposure to
    the airline industry, and for a discussion of how the Company
    manages concentration exposures. Certain distinctions between
    categories require management judgment.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    Includes corporate charge card receivables of $641 million
    from financial institutions, $21 million from U.S.
    Government agencies and $10.6 billion from other corporate
    institutions.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    Because charge card products have no preset spending limit, the
    associated credit limit on cardmember receivables is not
    quantifiable. Therefore, the quantified unused
    line-of-credit
    amounts only include the approximate credit line available on
    cardmember loans (including both for on-balance sheet loans and
    loans previously securitized).




 



    RISK
    ELEMENTS


 


    The following table presents the amounts of non-performing loans
    and cardmember receivables that are either non-accrual, past
    due, or restructured, segregated between U.S. and
    non-U.S. borrowers.
    Past due loans are loans that are contractually past due
    90 days or more as to principal or interest payments.
    Restructured loans and cardmember receivables are those that
    meet the definition of “Troubled Debt Restructurings”.

    (a) 
    
    
    The increase in impaired loans was due to the adoption of new
    GAAP effective January 1, 2010, which resulted in the
    consolidation of the Lending Trust as discussed further in
    Note 1 “Summary of Significant 







    
    64



Table of Contents







    
    
    



    

    
    
    Accounting Policies” on page 72 of the Annual Report.
    As a result of these changes, amounts as of December 31,
    2010 include impaired loans and receivables for both the Charge
    Trust and Lending Trust; correspondingly, amounts as of
    December 31, 2009 only include impaired loans and
    receivables for the Charge Trust and the seller’s interest
    portion of the Lending Trust. Amounts as of both balance sheet
    dates also include impaired loans and receivables associated
    with other non-securitized portfolios.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    The Company’s policy is generally to cease accruing
    interest income once a related cardmember loan is 180 days
    past due at which time the cardmember loan is written off. The
    Company establishes loan loss reserves for estimated
    uncollectible interest receivable balances prior to write-off.
    Beginning with 2009, certain cardmember loans placed with
    outside collection agencies are put on non-accrual status.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    As of December 31, 2009, these amounts primarily include
    certain cardmember loans placed with outside collection
    agencies. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2006 and 2005
    included a single loan to a U.S. commercial airline of
    approximately $104 million and $266 million,
    respectively, which was paid off in full during the second
    quarter of 2007. The loan was put on non-accrual status in the
    third quarter of 2005.



 


    
    (d) 
    
    
    Represents long-term and short-term modification programs or
    TDRs, wherein the terms of a loan or receivable have been
    modified for cardmembers that are experiencing financial
    difficulties and a concession has been granted to the borrower.
    The Company may modify cardmember loans and receivables and such
    modifications may include reducing the interest rate/delinquency
    fees on the loans and receivables and/or placing the cardmember
    on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the
    cardmember does not comply with the modified terms, then the
    loan or receivable agreement reverts back to its original terms.



 


    
    (e) 
    
    
    Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made
    to conform to the current presentation.




 



    IMPACT OF
    NON-PERFORMING LOANS ON INTEREST INCOME


 


    The following table presents the gross interest income for both
    non-accrual and restructured loans for 2010 that would have been
    recognized if such loans had been current in accordance with
    their original contractual terms, and had been outstanding
    throughout the period or since origination if held for only part
    of 2010. The table also presents the interest income related to
    these loans that was actually recognized for the period. These
    amounts are segregated between U.S. and
    non-U.S. borrowers.

    POTENTIAL
    PROBLEM RECEIVABLES


 


    This disclosure presents outstanding amounts as well as specific
    reserves for certain receivables where information about
    possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have
    serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply
    with the present repayment terms. At December 31, 2010, the
    Company did not identify any potential problem loans or
    receivables within the cardmember loans and receivables
    portfolio that were not already included in “Risk
    Elements” above.


 



    CROSS-BORDER
    OUTSTANDINGS


 


    Cross-border disclosure is based upon the Federal Financial
    Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”)
    guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. The
    Company has adopted the FFIEC guidelines for its cross-border
    disclosure starting with 2009 reporting.




    
    65



Table of Contents





    The primary differences between the FFIEC and Guide 3 guidelines
    for reporting cross-border exposure are:
    i) available-for-sale
    investment securities are reported based on amortized cost for
    FFIEC instead of fair value for Guide 3; ii) net local
    country claims are reduced by local country liabilities
    (regardless of currency denomination) excluding any debt that is
    funding the local assets through a foreign domiciled subsidiary
    for FFIEC compared to Guide 3 where only amounts in the same
    currencies are offset and such debt noted above is a reduction
    to local country claims; iii) the FFIEC methodology
    includes
    mark-to-market
    exposures of derivative assets which are excluded under Guide 3;
    and iv) investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are
    included under FFIEC but excluded under Guide 3.


 


    The following table presents the aggregate amount of
    cross-border outstandings from borrowers or counterparties for
    each foreign country that exceeds 1 percent of consolidated
    total assets for any of the periods reported below. Cross-border
    outstandings include loans, receivables, interest-bearing
    deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments
    and other monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars
    or other non-local currency.


 


    The table separately presents the amounts of cross-border
    outstandings by type of borrower including governments and
    official institutions, banks and other financial institutions
    and other, along with an analysis of local country assets net of
    local country liabilities.

    (a) 
    
    
    In 2010, only Mexico cross-border outstandings are between
    0.75 percent and 1.0 percent of consolidated total
    assets. Italy and Sweden were also included within 2009 or 2008
    as they exceeded the threshold, to be consistent with prior year
    presentation.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    Generally, all charge and credit cards have revocable lines of
    credit, and therefore, are not disclosed as cross-border
    commitments. Refer to loan concentrations on page 64 for
    amount of unused lines of credit.

    (a) 
    
    
    Refer to Note 5 “Reserves for Losses” on
    page 81 in the Annual Report for a discussion of
    management’s process for evaluating allowance for loan
    losses.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    In the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of
    reporting the cardmember lending net write-off rate.
    Historically, the net write-off rate has been presented using
    net write-off amounts for principal, interest, and fees.
    However, industry convention is generally to include only the
    net write-offs related to principal in write-off rate
    disclosures. The write-off rate for 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is
    a principal only write-off rate consistent with industry
    convention. The write-off rate for 2006 reflects principal only
    write-offs in the U.S. and total write-offs (principal,
    interest, and fees) outside the U.S. as principal only write-off
    information was not available outside the U.S. for 2006.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    For purposes of calculating the net write-off rate in accordance
    with (b) above, net write-offs were $3.3 billion,
    $2.9 billion, $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion,
    $1.2 billion for
    2010-2006,
    respectively.



 


    
    (d) 
    
    
    Includes $160 million of reserves in 2009, that were
    removed in connection with securitizations during the year. The
    offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained
    subordinated securities. This amount also includes foreign
    currency translation adjustments. The prior years included
    foreign currency translation and other adjustments primarily
    related to the reclassification of waived fee reserves to a
    contra-cardmember loan.



 


    
    (e) 
    
    
    Average cardmember loans are based on month end balances.

    Refer to Note 5 “Reserves for Losses” on
    page 81 in the Annual Report for a discussion of
    management’s process for evaluating allowance for
    receivable losses.



 


    
    (b) 
    
    
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time
    period in which past due cardmember receivables in U.S. Card
    Services are written off to 180 days past due, consistent
    with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables
    were written off when 360 days past billing. The net
    write-offs for 2008 include approximately $341 million
    resulting from this write-off methodology change.



 


    
    (c) 
    
    
    Includes foreign currency translation and other adjustments
    primarily related to the reclassification of waived fee reserves
    to a contra-cardmember receivable.



 


    
    (d) 
    
    
    The net write-off rate presented is on a worldwide basis and is
    based on write-offs of principal and fees. The U.S. Card
    Services write-off rate was 1.6 percent, for 2010. Averages
    are based on month end balances.



 


    
    (e) 
    
    
    The net loss ratio represents the worldwide ratio of charge card
    write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized
    and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less
    recoveries, on cardmember receivables expressed as a percent of
    gross amounts billed to customers. As a result of the change
    discussed in (b) above, the Company stopped calculating the
    worldwide net loss ratio beginning in 2008 based on
    360 days past billing methodology.

    The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for
    losses for loans and cardmember receivables and the percent of
    loans and cardmember receivables in each category of total loans
    and cardmember receivables, respectively, by customer type. The
    table segregates loans and cardmember receivables and related
    allowances for losses between U.S. and
    non-U.S. borrowers.

    For floating rate debt issuances, the stated interest rates are
    based on the floating rates in effect as of December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



 


    
    (b)

    (c) 
    
    
    Does not include non-interest-bearing short-term borrowings
    (i.e. book overdrafts).




 


    Short-term borrowings, including commercial paper and federal
    funds purchased, are defined as any debt instrument with an
    original maturity of 12 months or less. Federal funds
    purchased represent overnight and term funds as well as Federal
    Home Loan Bank advances. Commercial paper generally is issued in
    amounts not less than $100,000 and with maturities of
    270 days or less. Other short-term borrowings include
    certain book overdrafts (i.e., primarily timing differences
    arising in the ordinary course of business), short-term
    borrowings from banks, as well as interest-bearing amounts due
    to merchants in accordance with merchant service agreements.


 





    
    



    
    ITEM 1A.  

    
    RISK
    FACTORS





 


    This section highlights specific risks that could affect our
    Company and its businesses. You should carefully consider each
    of the following risks and all of the other information set
    forth in this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the
    following information identifies the most significant risk
    factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and
    uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those
    described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to us or that we currently believe to be
    immaterial may also adversely affect our business.


 


    If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into
    actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and
    uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or
    circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations. These
    events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of
    our securities.


 



    Current
    Economic and Political Risks


 



    Difficult
    conditions in the global capital markets and economy generally,
    as well as political conditions in the United States and
    elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and
    results of operations.


 


    Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions
    in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Table of Contents





    Ongoing concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the
    mortgage and real estate markets, sovereign debt crises, fear of
    a double-dip recession and geopolitical issues have contributed
    to uncertain expectations for the economy and the markets going
    forward. These factors, combined with still relatively low
    levels of consumer confidence and relatively high levels of
    unemployment, continue to impact global economies. This
    environment has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect
    on us, in part because we are very dependent upon consumer and
    business behavior. If the economy were to worsen, customer
    behaviors could change further. For example, Cardmembers could
    decide to redeem Membership Rewards points at abnormally high
    levels to replace cash expenditures.


 


    Factors such as consumer spending, business investment,
    government spending, interest rates, the volatility and strength
    of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and
    economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. An
    economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower
    family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business
    investment and lower consumer spending is likely to materially
    and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
    financial condition. Furthermore, the factors discussed above
    may cause our earnings, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate
    and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may
    have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our
    business, and may impact the trading price of our common shares.


 


    Political or economic instability in certain regions or
    countries could also affect our commercial or other lending
    activities, among other businesses, or result in restrictions on
    convertibility of certain currencies. In addition, our travel
    network may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and
    other conditions. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business
    and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline
    during general economic downturns.


 


    Terrorist attacks, intrusion into our infrastructure by
    “hackers” or other catastrophic events may have a
    negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the
    World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of
    the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events
    or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future could
    have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure,
    including our information technology systems. Because we derive
    a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our
    business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus is
    likely to decline during periods in which travelers become
    concerned about safety issues or when travel might involve
    health-related risks.


 


    We held approximately $5.8 billion of investment securities
    of state and municipal obligations as of December 31, 2010.
    In the event that actual default rates of these investment
    securities were to significantly change from historical patterns
    due to challenges in the economy or otherwise, it could have a
    material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio.


 


    If the conditions described above (or similar ones) were to
    persist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased
    adverse effects on our results of operations and financial
    condition.


 



    Adverse
    capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect
    our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost
    of capital.


 


    The global money and capital markets, while demonstrating
    generally improved conditions, remain susceptible to volatility
    and disruption, which could negatively impact market liquidity
    conditions.


 


    We need liquidity to pay merchants, operating expenses, interest
    on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing
    liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to
    limit our investments in growth opportunities or curtail
    operations. The principal sources of our liquidity are payments
    from Cardmembers and merchants, cash flow from our investment
    portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that
    are readily convertible into cash, direct and third-party
    distributed deposits, debt instruments such as unsecured medium-
    and long-term notes and asset securitizations, securitized
    borrowings through our conduit facility, the Federal Reserve
    discount window and long-term committed bank borrowing
    facilities in certain countries outside the United States.


 


    Notwithstanding our solid financial position, we are not immune
    from pressures experienced broadly across the financial markets.
    The fragility of the credit markets and the current economic and
    regulatory





    
    74

    environment have impacted financial services companies. Although
    the market for our unsecured term debt and asset securitizations
    has improved, there is no assurance that the markets will be
    open to us in the future. Therefore, our ability to obtain
    financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt
    and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand. In
    addition, our liquidity position will be impacted by our ability
    to meet our objectives with respect to the maintenance and
    growth of our direct and third-party distributed deposit
    programs. We also would have less flexibility in accessing the
    commercial paper market as a short-term funding vehicle in the
    event of a downgrade in Credco’s short-term debt rating and
    volatility in the commercial paper market generally.


 


    In the event that current sources of liquidity, including
    internal sources, do not satisfy our needs, we would be required
    to seek additional financing. The availability of additional
    financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market
    conditions, the general availability of credit and consumer
    deposits, the overall availability of credit to the financial
    services industry, our credit ratings (which were downgraded in
    April 2009 by two of the major ratings agencies), and credit
    capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders or depositors
    could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term
    financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the
    level of our business activity decreases due to an economic
    downturn.


 


    Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory
    authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us.
    While we have experienced positive credit trends since the
    latter half of 2009, if the performance of our charge card and
    credit card portfolios were to weaken through increasing
    delinquencies and write-offs, our long-term and short-term debt
    ratings could be downgraded and our access to capital could be
    materially adversely affected and our cost of capital could
    increase. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital
    and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required
    to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our
    ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities,
    satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital
    necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to
    delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost to raise
    capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly
    reduce financial flexibility. If levels of market disruption and
    volatility worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not
    experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our
    ability to access capital and on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.


 


    For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see
    “Financial Review — Funding Programs and
    Activities” on pages 42-46 of our 2010 Annual Report
    to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by
    reference.


 



    We can
    be adversely affected by the impairment of other financial
    institutions.


 


    Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be
    adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of
    other financial services institutions. Financial services
    institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,
    counterparty or other relationships. We routinely execute
    transactions with counterparties in the financial services
    industry, including commercial banks, investment banks and
    insurance companies. Defaults or non-performance by, or even
    rumors or questions about, one or more financial services
    institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have
    led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses
    or defaults by one or more of our counterparties, which, in
    turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.


 



    Any
    reduction in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
    credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and
    restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.


 


    Although the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term
    debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating
    agencies, the ratings of that debt were downgraded during the
    second quarter of 2009 by Moody’s Investors Services
    (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s
    (“S&P”), two of the major rating agencies. The
    rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and its
    subsidiaries, and their ratings of the Company’s and its
    subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt are based on a
    number of factors, including their financial strength as well as
    factors not entirely within their control, including conditions
    affecting the financial services industry





    
    75



Table of Contents





    generally, and the wider state of the economy. There can be no
    assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will maintain
    their current respective ratings. Failure to maintain those
    ratings could, among other things, adversely limit our access to
    the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other
    terms upon which the Company and its subsidiaries are able to
    obtain funding.


 


    The ability of issuers of asset-backed securities to obtain
    necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically
    been based, in part, on qualification under the FDIC’s safe
    harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations. In 2009
    and 2010, the FDIC issued a series of changes to its safe harbor
    rule, with its new final rule for its securitization safe
    harbor, issued in 2010, requiring issuers to comply with a new
    set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor.
    Issuances out of our American Express Credit Account Master
    Trust are “grandfathered” under the new FDIC final
    rule. The trust for the Company’s Cardmember charge
    receivable securitization (the “Charge Trust”) does
    not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the
    FDIC’s new safe harbor rule, nor did it meet the
    requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing
    prior to 2009. It was structured and continues to be structured
    such that the financial assets transferred to the Charge Trust
    would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in
    the event the FDIC is appointed as a receiver or conservator of
    the originating banks. The Company has received confirmation
    from Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Ratings, which rate
    issuances from the Charge Trust, that they will continue to rate
    issuances from the Charge Trust in the same manner as they have
    historically, even though they do not satisfy the requirements
    to be covered by the FDIC’s safe harbor rule. Nevertheless,
    one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that
    in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule, the
    highest rating a Charge Trust security could receive would be
    based on the originating bank’s unsecured debt rating. If
    one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion, it could
    adversely impact the Company’s capacity and cost of using
    its Charge Trust as a source of funding for its business.


 


    We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take. As with
    other companies in the financial services industry, the
    Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ratings could be
    downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the
    rating agencies.


 



    Adverse
    currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could
    decrease revenue we receive from our international
    operations.


 


    During 2010, over 33% of our revenue net of interest expense was
    generated from activities outside the United States. We are
    exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international
    operations, and some of the revenue we generate outside the
    United States is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate
    fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative
    to the U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are
    included in our net income. Furthermore, we may become subject
    to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit
    the conversion of our other revenue currencies into
    U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these events or
    circumstances could decrease the revenues we receive from our
    international operations and have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations.


 



    Legal and
    Regulatory Risks


 



    Ongoing
    legal proceedings regarding the Company’s
    “anti-steering” and surcharging-related contractual
    provisions could require changes to those provisions that could
    result in a material loss of revenue or increased expenses,
    substantial monetary judgments and/or damage to the
    Company’s global reputation and brand.


 


    The DOJ and certain state attorneys general have recently
    brought an action against the Company alleging that the
    provisions in the Company’s card acceptance agreements with
    merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against
    the Company’s card products at the point of sale violate
    the U.S. antitrust laws. Visa and MasterCard are also
    defendants in this proceeding, but they have entered into a
    proposed settlement, which is subject to judicial review and
    approval following a comment period. In addition, the Company is
    a defendant in a number of actions, including proposed class
    actions, filed by merchants that challenge the Company’s
    “anti-steering” provisions as well as
    surcharging-related provisions. Visa and MasterCard have been
    named as defendants in lawsuits that include similar allegations
    relating to their “anti-steering”
    and/or





    
    76



Table of Contents





    surcharging-related policies and rules. A description of these
    legal proceedings is contained in “Legal Proceedings”
    below. An adverse outcome in any of these proceedings against
    the Company could materially and adversely impact the
    profitability of the Company, require it to change its merchant
    agreements in a way that could expose the Company’s card
    products to steering or other forms of discrimination at the
    point of sale that would impair our Cardmember’s
    experience, result in the imposition of substantial monetary
    damages
    and/or
    damage the Company’s global reputation and brand. Even if
    the Company were not required to change its merchant agreements,
    changes in Visa and MasterCard’s policies or practices as a
    result of any such legal proceedings or regulatory actions could
    subject the Company to market pressures that could materially
    and adversely impact its profitability.


 



    The
    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may
    have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.


 


    In July 2010, President Obama signed into law Dodd-Frank.
    Dodd-Frank, as well as regulations promulgated thereunder, could
    have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s
    business, results of operations and financial condition by, for
    example, requiring the Company to change its business practices,
    requiring the Company to comply with more stringent capital,
    liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, limiting the
    Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities,
    imposing additional costs on the Company (including increased
    compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through
    the issuance of asset-backed securities), limiting the fees the
    Company can charge for services and impacting the value of the
    Company’s assets. A description of certain provisions of
    Dodd-Frank and other legislative and regulatory developments is
    contained in “Supervision and Regulation” above.


 


    Dodd-Frank will result in increased scrutiny and oversight of
    consumer financial services and products, primarily through the
    establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within
    the Federal Reserve. The Bureau will have broad rulemaking and
    enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and
    payment services and products and authority to prevent
    “unfair, deceptive or abusive” practices. The Bureau
    will write regulations under federal consumer financial
    protection laws, and enforce those laws against and examine
    large financial institutions like us, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB
    for compliance. The Bureau will collect fines and provide
    consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in
    consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request
    data and promote the availability of financial services to
    underserved consumers and communities. Depending on how the
    Bureau functions and its areas of focus, it could have a
    material adverse impact on our businesses. In addition to
    increasing our compliance costs and potentially delaying our
    ability to respond to marketplace changes, this could result in
    requirements to alter our products and services that would make
    our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability
    to offer them profitably. The impact this new regulatory regime
    will have on the Company’s business is uncertain at this
    time and will depend on, among other things, the timing of the
    Bureau’s assumption of its authority from other
    governmental agencies, which is expected to occur by
    July 21, 2011.


 


    Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to regulate
    interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for
    transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use
    prepaid card, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that
    such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a
    transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the
    costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive
    network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions.
    Additionally, Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from
    restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to
    encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such
    as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that such offers
    do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer.
    Further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable
    state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all
    prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously
    disclosed. Dodd-Frank also permits U.S. merchants to
    establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for
    credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not
    discriminate between networks or issuers. Federal government
    agencies and institutions of higher learning also are permitted
    to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided
    they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. For more
    information on this aspect of Dodd-Frank and its potential
    impact on our business, please see “Risk Factors-Banks,
    card issuers and card network operators generally are the
    subject of increasing global regulatory

    focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our
    Company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues
    through our network.”


 


    Dodd-Frank mandates the Federal Reserve to establish heightened
    capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management
    requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures,
    “living wills” and stress tests for, among others,
    bank holding companies that have greater than $50 billion
    in total consolidated assets, such as the Company. In addition,
    most interest rate and currency swaps will be required to be
    exchange-traded which may increase collateral posting
    requirements for the Company.


 


    Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the responsibility and authority of the
    OTS to supervise federal savings associations, including AEBFSB,
    will be transferred to the OCC on July 21, 2011 (unless
    extended for up to six months). AEBFSB will need to develop a
    relationship with its new regulator, and there could be
    additional compliance costs associated with aligning
    AEBFSB’s current compliance structure with the OCC’s
    expectations. Additionally, the transfer of responsibility from
    the OTS to the OCC could result in new regulatory standards as
    it is, at this time, unclear whether the OCC will adopt or
    modify OTS regulations, orders or policies, including
    interpretations or applications. Any shifts in current
    regulatory positions could adversely affect our results of
    operation.


 


    Many provisions of Dodd-Frank, including numerous provisions not
    described above, require the adoption of rules to implement. In
    addition, Dodd-Frank mandates multiple studies, which could
    result in additional legislative or regulatory action.
    Therefore, the ultimate consequences of Dodd-Frank and its
    implementing regulations on the Company’s business, results
    of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.


 



    The
    Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of
    2009 will significantly impact our business practices and could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations.


 


    The CARD Act required the Company to make fundamental changes to
    many of our business practices, including marketing,
    underwriting, pricing and billing. Among other things, the CARD
    Act prohibits an issuer from increasing the APR on outstanding
    balances (with limited exceptions), requires additional account
    disclosures, provides consumers with the right to opt out of
    significant changes to account terms, and restricts penalty fees
    and charges that may be imposed by an issuer. Most of the
    requirements of the CARD Act became effective in February 2010.
    Additional amendments to Regulation Z revising the open-end
    credit disclosure requirements became effective on July 1,
    2010.


 


    Since August 22, 2010, the CARD Act, among other things,
    requires that penalty fees be reasonable and proportional. Also,
    since August 22, 2010, the CARD Act requires issuers to
    periodically reevaluate APR increases to determine if a decrease
    is appropriate. The first of these reevaluations must be
    completed in February 2011. The obligation to periodically
    reevaluate APR increases is ongoing, and it is uncertain how
    these provisions will be interpreted or amended by the new
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Therefore, while the
    ultimate impact of this requirement is uncertain at this time,
    it could have a significant impact on our results of operations.


 


    While the Company has made certain changes to its product terms
    and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact of the
    changes required by the CARD Act, there is no assurance that it
    will be successful. The long-term impact of the CARD Act on the
    Company’s business practices and revenues will depend upon
    a number of factors, including its ability to successfully
    implement its business strategies, consumer behavior and the
    actions of the Company’s competitors, which are difficult
    to predict at this time. In the event the actions undertaken by
    the Company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation
    and regulations are not ultimately effective, they could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, including its revenue and net income.

    Our
    business is subject to significant and extensive government
    regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our
    results of operations and financial condition.


 


    On November 14, 2008, American Express Company and TRS each
    became bank holding companies under the BHC Act and elected to
    be treated as financial holding companies under the BHC Act. As
    a result of becoming a bank holding company, we are subject to
    regulation by the Federal Reserve, including, without
    limitation, consolidated capital regulation at the holding
    company level, maintenance of certain capital and management
    standards in connection with our two U.S. depository
    institutions and restrictions on our non-banking activities
    under the Federal Reserve’s regulations.


 


    If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements applicable to bank
    holding companies, our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely affected.


 


    We are also subject to extensive government regulation and
    supervision in jurisdictions around the world, both as a
    participant in the financial services industry and otherwise.
    Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect
    depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the
    banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our
    shareholders or creditors. Among other things, as a result of
    regulators enforcing existing laws and regulations, we could be
    fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business
    activities, subject to limitations or conditions on our business
    activities or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or
    other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our
    business or with respect to our employees. There is also the
    risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of
    existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses may be
    imposed which could impact the profitability of the
    Company’s business activities, limit our ability to pursue
    business opportunities, require the Company to change certain of
    its business practices or alter its relationships with
    customers, affect retention of key Company personnel, or expose
    the Company to additional costs (including increased compliance
    costs). Such changes also may require us to invest significant
    management attention and resources to make any necessary changes
    and could adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.


 


    Please see “Supervision and Regulation” beginning on
    page 38 for more information about the regulation to which
    we are subject.


 



    We are
    subject to capital adequacy guidelines and, if we fail to meet
    these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely
    affected.


 


    Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other
    regulatory requirements, the Company, TRS and our subsidiary
    banks, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, must meet guidelines for
    capital adequacy and leverage ratios that include quantitative
    measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet
    items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about
    components, risk weightings and other factors. As discussed
    above under “Supervision and Regulation — Capital
    Adequacy”, the capital requirements applicable to the
    Company and TRS as bank holding companies and our subsidiary
    depository institutions are in the process of being
    substantially revised, including in connection with our
    transition to Basel II and as a result of Basel III
    and the requirements of Dodd-Frank. If the Company, TRS or our
    subsidiary depository institutions fail to meet current or
    future minimum capital, leverage or other financial
    requirements, their respective financial conditions would be
    materially adversely affected. In light of recent market events,
    Dodd-Frank and Basel III, the Company, TRS and our subsidiary
    depository institutions will be required to satisfy additional,
    more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past. We
    cannot fully predict the final form of, or the effects of, these
    regulations. Failure by any of the Company, TRS or a subsidiary
    depository institution to maintain its respective status as
    “well capitalized” and “well managed,” if
    unremedied over a period of time, would cause us to lose our
    status as a financial holding company and could compromise our
    competitive position. For more information on capital adequacy
    requirements, please see “Supervision and
    Regulation — Capital Adequacy” above.

    We are
    subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends
    and repurchase our capital stock.


 


    We are limited in our ability to pay dividends by our regulators
    who could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe
    or unsound banking practice. For example, it is the policy of
    the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally
    pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if
    prospective earnings retention is consistent with the
    organization’s expected future needs, asset quality, and
    financial condition. Recently issued temporary guidance from the
    Federal Reserve states that our dividend policies will be
    assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve
    Basel III capital ratio requirements. A company that has
    not achieved Basel III capital requirements on a fully
    phased-in basis may have difficulty increasing dividends.


 


    While the regulations ultimately applicable to the Company will
    be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates
    that, had regulations implementing Basel III been in place
    during the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company’s capital
    ratios under Basel III would have exceeded the minimum
    requirements. This estimate could change in the future. While we
    expect to meet the Basel III capital requirements,
    inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, as phased in by
    the Federal Reserve, the regulations ultimately applicable to us
    may be substantially different from the Basel III final
    framework as published in December 2010. Moreover, the Federal
    Reserve will closely scrutinize any dividend payout ratios
    exceeding 30% of after-tax net income.


 


    During the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased
    14 million shares of our common stock through our share
    repurchase program. On January 7, 2011, we submitted our
    Comprehensive Capital Plan (“CCP”) to the Federal
    Reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share
    repurchases in 2011. The CCP includes an analysis of performance
    and capital availability under certain adverse economic
    assumptions. We expect a response from the Federal Reserve by
    the end of the first quarter. No additional shares are expected
    to be repurchased prior to its response. We cannot predict
    whether the Federal Reserve will approve additional share
    purchases.


 


    For more information on bank holding company dividend
    restrictions, please see “Supervision and
    Regulation — General — Dividends” on
    page 46, as well as “Financial Review —
    Share Repurchases and Dividends” on page 41 and
    Note 23 on page 111 of our 2010 Annual Report to
    Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by
    reference.


 



    Banks,
    card issuers and card network operators generally are the
    subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may impose
    costly new compliance burdens on our Company and lead to
    decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our
    network.


 


    We are subject to regulations that affect banks and the payments
    industry in the United States and many other countries in which
    our charge and credit Cards are used and where we conduct
    banking and Card activities. In particular, we are subject to
    numerous regulations applicable to financial institutions in the
    United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as
    a provider of services to financial institutions. Regulation of
    the payments industry has increased significantly in recent
    years. For example, we are subject to certain provisions of the
    Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to
    maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. Increased
    regulatory focus in this area could result in additional
    obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of
    products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries
    in which our charge and credit Cards may be used, and the types
    of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our charge
    and credit Cards. In addition, the member states of the European
    Economic Area have now implemented a relatively new European
    Union legislative directive, called the Payment Services
    Directive, for electronic payment services, including cards,
    that puts in place a common legal framework for licensing and
    supervision of payment services providers, including card
    issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of
    business.


 


    Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also
    considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft,
    account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and
    marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to
    increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards. These new
    requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit
    cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could
    decrease





    
    80



Table of Contents





    our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations
    and legislation could have the effect of limiting our ability to
    offer new types of charge or credit cards or restricting our
    ability to offer existing Cards, such as stored value cards,
    which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and
    revenue growth.


 


    In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the
    United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation
    of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card
    issuers and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards.
    Regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Poland,
    Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, the European Union, Australia,
    Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, among others, have conducted
    investigations that are either ongoing, concluded or on appeal.


 


    The interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by
    the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in
    “four party” payment networks, like Visa and
    MasterCard, is generally the largest component of the merchant
    service charge charged to merchants for bankcard debit and
    credit card acceptance in these systems. By contrast, the
    American Express network does not have interchange fees.
    Although the regulators’ focus has primarily been on Visa
    and MasterCard as the dominant card networks and on their
    operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and
    government regulation relating to merchant pricing could
    ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange
    and/or
    merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for
    other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees or
    interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or
    eliminating rewards programs.


 


    In the United States, Congress continued to focus on the
    interchange issue during 2010. Congress passed Dodd-Frank, which
    the President signed into law in July 2010. Dodd-Frank gives the
    Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding
    interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for
    transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use
    prepaid card, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that
    such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a
    transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the
    costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive
    network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions.
    American Express does not offer a debit card linked to a deposit
    account, but does issue various types of prepaid cards.
    Reloadable general-use prepaid cards, but not those marketed or
    labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, are exempt from the
    interchange fee limitations. In contrast to the interchange fee
    limitations, all prepaid cards would be subject to the exclusive
    network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions.
    In December 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a Notice of
    Proposed Rulemaking requesting comments to implement the
    interchange fee limitations and exclusive network routing
    restrictions. The Federal Reserve must issue final rules on the
    exclusive network routing restrictions by July 21, 2011.
    The statute does not specify when those rules must take effect.
    It is difficult to assess at this time the extent to which the
    final regulations, once issued, could adversely impact our
    revenues and profitability.


 


    Additionally, Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from
    restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to
    encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such
    as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that such offers
    do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer.
    Further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable
    state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all
    prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously
    disclosed. Dodd-Frank also permits U.S. merchants to
    establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for
    credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not
    discriminate between networks or issuers. Federal government
    agencies and institutions of higher learning are also permitted
    to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided
    they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. As a
    result of these new laws, customers may be incentivized by
    merchants to move away from the use of charge and credit card
    products to other forms of payment, such as debit, which could
    adversely affect our revenues and profitability.


 


    During the last four years, a number of bills were proposed in
    individual state legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit
    card interchange fees or to prohibit credit card companies from
    charging a merchant discount on the sales tax portion of credit
    card purchases. Other proposals were aimed at increasing the
    transparency of card network rules for merchants. In addition, a
    number of bills were proposed to establish merchant liability
    for the costs of a data security breach of a merchant’s
    system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to
    protect sensitive cardholder payment information. In 2010,
    Vermont enacted legislation that permits merchants to set a
    minimum dollar value of no more than $10 for acceptance of any
    form of





    
    81



Table of Contents





    payment; permits merchants to provide discounts or other
    benefits based on the form of payment (i.e., card, cash, check,
    debit card, stored-value card, charge card or credit card); and
    permits merchants to accept the cards of a payment system at one
    or more of its locations but not at others. This legislation may
    serve as a model for other states. In the event that additional
    legislative or regulatory activity to limit interchange or
    merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security
    legislation is adopted, our revenues and profitability could be
    adversely affected.


 


    Increased regulatory focus on our Company, such as in connection
    with the matters discussed above, may increase our compliance
    costs or result in a reduction of transactions processed on our
    networks or merchant discount revenues from such transactions,
    which could materially and adversely impact our results of
    operations.


 



    If we
    are not able to protect our intellectual property, and invest
    successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of,
    technological developments across all our businesses, our
    revenue and profitability could be negatively
    affected.


 


    Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
    changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to
    continue to invest in business process and technology advances
    across all areas of our business, including in transaction
    processing, data management, customer interactions and
    communications, travel reservations systems, prepaid products,
    alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and
    compliance systems. We rely in part on third parties, including
    some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the
    development of and access to new technologies. We expect that
    new technologies applicable to the payments industry will
    continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior
    to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our
    Cards, networks and other services. Because of evolving payments
    technologies and the competitive landscape, we may not, among
    other things, be successful in increasing or maintaining our
    share of online spending and enhancing our Cardmembers’
    digital experience, which could have an adverse effect on our
    revenues and profitability. Our ability to develop, acquire, or
    access competitive technologies or business processes on
    acceptable terms may be limited by patent rights that third
    parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may
    assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies that
    we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide
    standards or by resistance from Cardmembers or merchants to such
    changes.


 


    We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual
    property and proprietary information, including copyrights,
    trademarks, patents and controls on access and distribution.
    These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement
    of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a
    resulting loss of competitive advantage. In addition,
    competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems,
    processes or technologies infringe their intellectual property
    rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive
    technological and business environment in which we operate and
    the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property
    related litigation, we cannot assure you that a future assertion
    of an infringement claim against us will not cause us to lose
    significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty or
    technology development expenses, or pay significant monetary
    damages.


 



    Regulation
    in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our
    costs and decrease the number of charge and credit Cards
    issued.


 


    We are subject to various regulations related to privacy and
    data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by
    these regulations. For example, in the United States, we are
    subject to the safeguards guidelines under the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The safeguards guidelines require that
    each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a
    written, comprehensive information security program containing
    safeguards that are appropriate to the financial
    institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of
    the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity
    of any customer information at issue. Broad-ranging data
    security laws that affect our business have also been adopted by
    various states, such as Massachusetts and Nevada.


 


    Compliance with these laws regarding the protection of customer
    and employee data could result in higher compliance and
    technology costs for the Company, as well as potentially
    significant fines and penalties





    
    82



Table of Contents





    for non-compliance. Many foreign jurisdictions in which we
    operate are also expanding the scope of their data security
    requirements and standards, as well as increasing enforcement
    activity in this area. In 1995, the European Parliament and
    Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of
    individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and
    on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the
    Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an
    individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical
    and organizational measures to protect personal data. The Data
    Protection Directive has been implemented through local laws
    regulating data protection in European Union Member States. As
    these laws are interpreted throughout the European Union where
    we have a significant commercial presence, compliance costs are
    increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that
    adequate data security protections and data transfer mechanisms
    are in place. In July 2010, we submitted for review by relevant
    European data protection authorities our draft binding corporate
    rules for processing of data within the American Express group
    which, once approved, will enable a more efficient basis on
    which to transfer data within our group.


 


    In addition to the foregoing enhanced data security
    requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and
    as many as 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico
    and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data breach regulations and
    laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the
    event of a security breach. Data breach laws are also becoming
    more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate,
    including Japan, Mexico and Germany. In many countries that have
    yet to impose automatic data breach notification requirements,
    regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant
    sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to
    encourage voluntary notification and discourage data breaches.
    Many of these regulations also apply broadly to
    retailers/merchants that accept our Cards; thus, to the extent
    they experience data security breaches, this presents additional
    risks for American Express and our Cardmembers.


 


    In addition, federal legislators and regulators are increasingly
    pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted,
    could further restrict how the Company collects, uses, shares
    and secures customer information, which could impact some of the
    Company’s current or planned business initiatives. For
    example, a recent FTC report, which applies to a company’s
    collection and use of customer information both online and
    offline, would impose greater transparency, use, disclosure and
    consumer choice obligations on the Company, and may ultimately
    result in the creation of an online mechanism through which
    consumers could opt out of all online tracking for online
    behavioral advertising purposes. A companion report by the
    United States Department of Commerce (“DOC”) would
    require companies to be more transparent in their online privacy
    practices, and recommends the creation of a national data
    security/data breach standard. Both the FTC and the DOC are
    expected to release final reports by the end of 2011.
    Additionally, two draft privacy bills were introduced in the
    111th Congress in the summer of 2010, and a number of
    federal legislators have either expressed their support for
    these draft bills or have indicated their intent to introduce
    new bills in the 112th Congress. If adopted, any such
    privacy bill could have a significant impact on the
    Company’s current and planned data privacy and security
    practices, could increase our costs of compliance and business
    operations and could reduce revenues from certain business
    initiatives.


 


    We continue to seek ways to minimize these risks and costs
    internally by improving our own data privacy and security
    policies and practices, and externally through regular
    improvements to the PCI Data Security Standard and by placing
    strong contractual obligations on retailers/merchants that
    accept our Cards, as well as on our service providers and
    business partners, relating to data security and data breach. We
    also have undertaken measures to assess the level of access to
    customer data by employees and our partners and service
    providers, and to ensure that such access is limited to the
    least privileged level necessary to perform their job or
    function for the Company. Still, increased regulation and
    enforcement activity throughout the world in the areas of data
    privacy and data security/breach may materially increase our
    costs and may decrease the number of our Cards that we issue, or
    restrict our ability to fully exploit our closed-loop
    capability, which could materially and adversely affect our
    profitability. Our failure to comply with the privacy and data
    security/breach laws and regulations to which we are subject
    could also result in fines, sanctions and damage to our global
    reputation and our brand.

    Our
    success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and
    other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could
    materially adversely affect our business.


 


    Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and
    other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant
    industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Our
    senior management team is relatively small and we believe we are
    in a critical period of competition in the financial services
    and payments industry. The market for qualified individuals is
    highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain
    qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members
    of our senior management team or other key personnel. As further
    described in “Supervision and Regulation —
    Compensation Practices” on pages 52-53, our
    compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by
    the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of our
    depository institution subsidiaries are subject to review and
    oversight by the FDIC and the OTS (and beginning in July 2011,
    the OCC). As a large financial and banking institution, we may
    be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may
    or may not affect our competitors, by the Federal Reserve, the
    FDIC or other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including
    limitations on any incentive compensation policies pursuant to
    Dodd-Frank, could further affect our ability to attract and
    retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss
    of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.


 



    Litigation
    and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines,
    penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in increased
    expenses.


 


    Businesses in the credit card industry have historically been
    subject to significant legal actions, including class action
    lawsuits and patent claims. Many of these actions have included
    claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. In
    addition, we may be involved in various actions or proceedings
    brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of
    noncompliance with laws or regulations, which could subject us
    to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting
    in increased expenses and damage to our global reputation and
    our brand.


 



    Business
    Risks


 



    Our
    operating results may suffer because of substantial and
    increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments
    industry.


 


    The payments industry is highly competitive and includes, in
    addition to charge, credit and debit card networks and issuers,
    cash, credit and ACH, as well as evolving alternative payment
    mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators (e.g.,
    PayPal), wireless payment technologies (including using mobile
    telephone networks to carry out transactions), prepaid systems
    and systems linked to payment cards, and bank transfer models.
    We are the third largest general-purpose charge and credit card
    network based on charge volume, behind Visa and MasterCard,
    which we believe are larger than we are in most countries. As a
    result, other card issuers may be able to benefit from the
    strong position and marketing and pricing power of Visa and
    MasterCard.


 


    Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial
    services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by
    major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of
    significant issuers. Continuing consolidation in the banking
    industry may result in a financial institution with a strong
    relationship with us being acquired by an institution that has a
    strong relationship with a competitor, resulting in a potential
    loss of business for us. The largest competing issuers have
    continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card
    portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail
    branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains
    intense. We are also subject to increasing pricing pressure from
    our competitors.


 


    In addition, some of our competitors have developed, or may
    develop, substantially greater financial and other resources
    than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services
    than we offer or may use more effective advertising and
    marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or
    merchant acceptance than we have. We may not continue to be able
    to compete effectively against these threats. Our competitors
    may also be more efficient in introducing innovative products,
    programs and services than we are. Spending on our Cards could
    be impacted by consumer usage of debit cards, as we do not
    currently offer a





    
    84



Table of Contents





    debit card linked to a deposit account, but we do issue various
    types of prepaid cards. In fact, the purchase volume and number
    of transactions made with debit cards in the United States has
    grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions.


 


    Internationally, competition remains fierce, and as a result, we
    may not be successful in accelerating our growth outside of the
    United States through proprietary consumer, small business and
    corporate products, GNS partners and alternative payment
    vehicles.


 


    New technologies, together with the portability provided by
    smartphones and tablets and evolving consumer behavior with
    social networking, are rapidly changing the way people interact
    with each other and transact business all around the world. In
    this connection, traditional and non-traditional competitors
    such as mobile telecommunications companies are working to
    deliver digital and mobile payment services for both consumers
    and merchants.


 


    In the United States, alternative payment vehicles that seek to
    redirect customers to payment systems based on ACH continue to
    emerge and grow, and existing debit networks also continue to
    expand both on-and off-line and are making efforts to develop
    online PIN functionality, which could further reduce the
    relative use of charge and credit cards online.


 


    To the extent alternative payment mechanisms, systems and
    products continue to successfully expand in the online payments
    space, our discount revenues and our ability to access
    transaction data through our closed-loop network could be
    negatively impacted. The Company has recently created an
    Enterprise Growth Group to focus on this strategic challenge by
    generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis,
    both organically and through acquisitions, in areas such as
    online and mobile payments and fee-based services. While
    expanding the Enterprise Growth Group is a top priority for the
    Company, many of the growth initiatives will involve new areas
    for the Company and we may not be successful in executing our
    strategy.


 


    Regulators have recently put forward various proposals that may
    impact our businesses, including proposals relating to
    restrictions on the type of activities in which financial
    institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial
    institutions, and proposals to impose taxes or fees on certain
    financial institutions. These or similar proposals, which may
    not apply to all of our competitors, could impact our ability to
    compete effectively.


 



    We
    face increasingly intense competitive pressure that may impact
    the prices we charge merchants who accept our Cards for payment
    for goods and services.


 


    Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on
    high revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business
    model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, which
    represents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their
    Cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is
    primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest
    single revenue source. In recent years, we have been under
    market pressure to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake
    other repricing initiatives. In addition, differentiated payment
    models from non-traditional players in the alternative payments
    space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose
    challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact
    our average discount rate. As a priority in 2011, we are seeking
    to drive greater value to our merchants, which if not
    successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and
    financial results. If we continue to experience a decline in the
    average merchant discount rate or are unable to sustain merchant
    discount rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volume
    growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and
    profitability could be materially and adversely affected.


 



    We may
    not be successful in our efforts to promote Card usage through
    our marketing, promotion and rewards programs or to effectively
    control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our
    profitability.


 


    Our business is characterized by the high level of spending by
    our Cardmembers. Increasing consumer and business spending and
    borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit
    and charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid
    products, and growth in Card lending balances, depend in part on
    our





    
    85



Table of Contents





    ability to develop and issue new or enhanced Card and prepaid
    products and increase revenues from such products. One of the
    ways in which we attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember
    attrition and seek to capture a greater share of customers’
    total spending on Cards issued on our network, both in the
    United States and in our international operations, is through
    our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Cardmember
    benefits. We may not be able to cost effectively manage and
    expand Cardmember benefits, including containing the growth of
    marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and Cardmember
    services expenses. In addition, many credit card issuers have
    instituted rewards and co-brand programs that are similar to
    ours, and issuers may in the future institute programs that are
    more attractive to cardmembers than our programs.


 


    During the last several years, we have received quarterly
    payments from each of Visa and MasterCard under the agreements
    that we entered into with each company to settle claims made
    against them in separate antitrust actions. We recognized
    $280 million ($172 million after-tax) from Visa in
    2010 and 2009, and $600 million ($372 million
    after-tax) from MasterCard in 2010 and 2009. Our ability to
    continue to invest in marketing, promotion and rewards programs,
    as well as our overall profitability, may be negatively impacted
    if we are unable to replace the payments provided to us under
    our settlements with MasterCard and Visa once the aggregate
    settlement amounts have been paid in full through the second and
    fourth quarters of 2011, respectively.


 



    Our
    brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our
    business may be affected by how we are perceived in the
    marketplace.


 


    Our brand and its attributes are key assets of the Company. Our
    ability to attract and retain consumer Cardmembers and corporate
    clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our
    level of service, trustworthiness, business practices and
    financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding
    these matters could damage our reputation among existing and
    potential Cardmembers and corporate clients, which could make it
    difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers and maintain
    existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to our industry
    may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or
    result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or
    litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for
    areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative
    perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect
    our revenues and profitability.


 



    We may
    not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our
    acquisitions and investment activity.


 


    We have recently acquired a number of businesses, including our
    acquisitions of Serve, Accertify and Loyalty Partner, which is
    pending. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into
    discussions regarding a wide array of potential transactions.
    These transactions could be material to our financial condition
    and results of operations. The process of integrating an
    acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will
    continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and
    expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:
    implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and
    policies at the acquired company; diversion of management time
    and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration
    challenges; coordination of product, engineering, and sales and
    marketing functions; transition of operations, users, and
    customers onto our existing platforms; cultural challenges
    associated with integrating employees from the acquired company
    into our organization; retention of employees from the
    businesses we acquire; integration of the acquired
    company’s accounting, management information, human
    resource, and other administrative systems; liability for
    activities of the acquired company before the acquisition,
    including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations
    of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known
    and unknown liabilities; litigation or other claims in
    connection with the acquired company, including claims from
    terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other
    third parties; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to
    integrate operations across different cultures and languages and
    to address the particular economic, currency, political, and
    regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and failure
    to successfully further develop the acquired technology.




    
    86



Table of Contents





    Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered
    in connection with our past or future acquisitions and
    investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated
    benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur
    unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.


 



    An
    increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using
    our Cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and
    could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit
    Cards.


 


    We and other third parties store Cardmember account information
    in connection with our charge and credit Cards. Criminals are
    using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture various
    types of information relating to Cardmembers’ accounts,
    including Membership Rewards accounts, to engage in illegal
    activities such as fraud and identity theft. As outsourcing and
    specialization become a more acceptable and common way of doing
    business in the payments industry, there are more third parties
    involved in processing transactions using our Cards. If data
    breaches or fraud levels involving our Cards were to rise, it
    could lead to regulatory intervention (such as mandatory card
    reissuance), increased concerns of customers relating to the
    privacy of their data and reputational and financial damage to
    our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our
    Cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business.


 



    We
    have agreements with business partners in a variety of
    industries, including the airline industry, that represent a
    significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks
    associated with these industries, including bankruptcies,
    restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners,
    and the possible obligation to make payments to our
    partners.


 


    In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different
    types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a
    variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with
    Costco and Delta Air Lines to offer co-branded cards for
    consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership
    Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many
    industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits to
    Cardmember participants. Under some types of these contractual
    arrangements, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events,
    we may be obligated to make payments to certain co-brand
    partners, merchants, vendors and customers. If we are not able
    to effectively manage the triggering events, we could
    unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which
    could have a negative effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Similarly, we have credit risk to certain
    co-brand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty
    program points that will not be fully redeemed for multi-year
    periods. We are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies,
    restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may
    occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our
    billed business, which could negatively impact particular card
    products and services (and billed business generally) and our
    financial condition and results of operations. For example, we
    could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected
    to reimburse Cardmembers for products and services purchased
    from merchants that are bankrupt or have ceased operations.


 


    The airline industry represents a significant portion of our
    billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies,
    restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. During
    2010, there continued to be significant consolidation in the
    airline industry, particularly in the United States (e.g.,
    United Airlines/Continental Airlines and the pending merger of
    Southwest Airlines and AirTran), through mergers
    and/or
    grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances and joint
    ventures, and this trend could continue. In particular, the
    United States Department of Transportation has granted antitrust
    immunity to members of the Skyteam, Star and Oneworld Alliances,
    enabling the covered airlines to closely coordinate their
    cross-regional operations and to launch highly integrated joint
    ventures in transatlantic and other markets, including jointly
    pricing and managing capacity on covered routes, sharing
    revenues and costs, and coordinating sales and corporate
    contracts, all outside of the scope of the U.S. antitrust
    laws. The European Commission has similarly approved the
    Oneworld Alliance, and its review of the other alliances is
    continuing. Increasing consolidation and expanded antitrust
    immunity could create challenges for our relationships with the
    airlines including by reducing our profitability on our airline
    business.


 


    Airlines are also some of the most important and valuable
    partners in our Membership Rewards program. If a participating
    airline merged with an airline that did not participate in
    Membership Rewards, the combined airline would have to determine
    whether or not to continue participation. Similarly, if one of
    our co-brand





    
    87



Table of Contents





    airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing
    co-brand card, the combined airline would have to determine
    which co-brand cards it would offer. If an airline determined to
    withdraw from Membership Rewards or to cease offering an
    American Express co-brand card, whether as the result of a
    merger or otherwise, such as our recent announcement that
    Continental Airlines will no longer participate in the Airport
    Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Cardmembers or
    the Membership Rewards points transfer program as of
    October 1, 2011, our business could be adversely affected.
    For additional information relating to the general risks related
    to the airline industry, see “Financial Review —
    Exposure to Airline Industry” on page 60 of our 2010
    Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by

    Our
    reengineering and other cost control initiatives may not prove
    successful, and we may not realize all or a significant portion
    of the benefits we intended.


 


    We have regularly undertaken, and are currently undertaking, a
    variety of efforts to reengineer our business operations in
    order to achieve cost savings and other benefits (including the
    reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing,
    promotion, rewards and infrastructure), enhance
    revenue-generating opportunities and improve our operating
    expense to revenue ratio both in the short-term and over time.
    These efforts include cost management, structural and strategic
    measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations
    consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among others,
    technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower
    cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions
    to the Internet to save costs and planned staff reductions
    relating to certain of these reengineering actions. If we do not
    successfully achieve these efforts in a timely manner or if we
    are not able to capitalize on these efforts, including the
    ability of the Global Services Group to generate an annualized
    level of gross expense savings of approximately
    $500 million by 2012, or if the actions taken ultimately
    come at the expense of operational efficiency, we may not
    realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we
    intended. Failure to achieve these benefits could have a
    negative effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.


 



    Our
    risk management policies and procedures may not be
    effective.


 


    We must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt,
    business loans, settlement risk with regard to GNS partners,
    merchant bankruptcies, the rate of bankruptcies, and other
    credit trends that can affect spending on Card products, debt
    payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses
    that accept our Card products.


 


    Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty
    default. We are exposed to both consumer credit risk,
    principally from Cardmember receivables and our other consumer
    lending activities, and institutional credit risk from
    merchants, GNS partners and GCC clients. Third parties may
    default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of
    liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country,
    regional and political risks are components of credit risk.
    Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often
    precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase
    our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and an
    increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our
    profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and
    may increase our cost of funds.


 


    Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our
    outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates
    may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in
    managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete.
    Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific
    clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries
    and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default
    risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult
    to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive
    full information with respect to the credit risks of our
    customers.


 


    We must also effectively manage market risk to which we are
    exposed. Market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios
    and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market
    variables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in
    our Card business and in our investment portfolios. Changes in
    the interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the
    value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we
    pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest
    we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently
    our net income, could fall.




    
    88

    We must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in
    our investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments
    that are not readily marketable.


 


    Additionally, we must effectively manage liquidity risk to which
    we are exposed. Liquidity risk is defined as the inability to
    access cash and equivalents needed to meet business requirements
    and satisfy our obligations. If we are unsuccessful in managing
    our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which
    can be costly and limit financial flexibility, or we may be too
    illiquid, which could result in financial distress during a
    liquidity event. For additional information regarding our
    management of liquidity risk, see “Adverse capital and
    credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to
    meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of
    capital” above.


 


    Finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we
    are exposed. We consider operational risk to be the risk of not
    achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed
    processes or information systems, human error or the external
    environment (i.e., natural disasters) including losses due to
    failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risks
    include the risk that we may not comply with specific regulatory
    or legal requirements, exposing us to fines
    and/or
    penalties and possibly brand damage; employee error or
    intentional misconduct that results in a material financial
    misstatement; or a failure to monitor an outsource
    partner’s compliance with a service level agreement,
    resulting in economic harm to us.


 


    Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our
    risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue
    to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other risk
    management techniques may not be fully effective. See
    “Financial Review — Risk Management” on
    pages 48-50 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders for a
    discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify,
    monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our
    businesses. Management of credit, market and operational risk
    requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record
    properly and verify a large number of transactions and events,
    and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.


 



    An
    inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or
    regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our
    liquidity position and our ability to fund our
    business.


 


    As a source of funding, our banking subsidiaries offer deposits
    to individuals through brokerage networks as well as directly to
    consumers.


 


    As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $29.7 billion in total customer deposits. The majority of
    the Company’s outstanding U.S. retail deposits have
    been raised through third-party channels and, as such, are
    considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. As
    part of our funding strategy, a majority of the deposits raised
    during 2010 were sourced directly by the Company with consumers
    through Personal Savings from American Express. Many other
    financial services firms are increasing their use of deposit
    funding, and as such we may experience increased competition in
    the deposit markets, particularly as to brokerage networks. We
    cannot predict how this increased competition will affect
    deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. If we are required
    to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits,
    our funding costs will be adversely impacted.


 


    Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive
    interest rates on deposits also is dependent on capital levels
    of our bank subsidiaries. The FDIA generally prohibits a bank,
    including our banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered
    deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits
    significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal
    market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are
    solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or
    (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from
    the FDIC. A bank that is less than well capitalized generally
    may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including
    direct-to-consumer
    deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national
    rate published by the FDIC unless the FDIC determines that the
    bank is operating in a high-rate area. An adequately capitalized
    insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll
    over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been
    granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC.
    Undercapitalized depository institutions may not solicit
    deposits by offering interest rates that are significantly
    higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits
    in such institution’s normal market areas or in the market
    area in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted. There
    are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized
    (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance
    provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to
    cease and





    
    89

    desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive
    issued by its federal regulator). If a depository
    institution’s federal regulator determines that it is in an
    unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in unsafe or unsound
    banking practices, the regulator may reclassify a well
    capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, require an
    adequately capitalized institution to comply with certain
    restrictions as if it were undercapitalized, and require an
    undercapitalized institution take certain actions applicable to
    significantly undercapitalized institutions.


 


    While Centurion Bank and AEBFSB were considered “well
    capitalized” for these purposes as of December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2010, there can be no assurance that
    they will continue to meet this definition. Basel III, when
    implemented by the U.S. banking agencies and fully
    phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a
    greater emphasis on common equity. Additionally, our regulators
    can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time
    and have authority to place limitations on our deposit
    businesses, including the interest rate we pay on deposits. An
    inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could
    materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our
    ability to fund our business.


 


    If our global network systems are disrupted or we are
    unable to process transactions efficiently or at all, our
    revenue and profitability would be materially reduced.


 


    Our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems
    may experience service interruptions as a result of fire,
    natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or
    local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism or accident. A
    natural disaster or other problem at our facilities could
    interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely on third-party
    service providers for the timely transmission of information
    across our global network. If a service provider fails to
    provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a
    result of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or
    any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services,
    adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability
    and materially reduce our revenue and profitability.


 



    We
    rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and
    other services integral to the operations of our businesses.
    These third parties may act in ways that could harm our
    business.


 


    We operate a service network around the world.  In
    order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource
    to third-party vendors many of the computer systems and other
    services that are integral to the operations of our global
    businesses. A significant amount of this outsourcing occurs in
    developing countries. We are subject to the risk that certain
    decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service
    providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our
    activities. In addition, the management of multiple third-party
    vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our
    control. It is also possible that the cost efficiencies of
    certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for these
    services increases around the world.


 



    Our
    business is subject to the effects of weather and natural
    disasters.


 


    As previously disclosed, natural disasters, severe weather
    conditions and other catastrophic events can have a negative
    effect on the Company’s business. Because the Company
    derives a portion of its revenues from travel-related spending,
    its business is sensitive to disruptions in air travel and other
    forms of travel caused by such events. Such disruptions can
    result in the payment of claims under travel interruption
    insurance policies that the Company offers and, if such
    disruptions to travel are prolonged, they can materially
    adversely affect overall travel-related spending. If the
    conditions described above (or similar ones) result in
    widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations.
