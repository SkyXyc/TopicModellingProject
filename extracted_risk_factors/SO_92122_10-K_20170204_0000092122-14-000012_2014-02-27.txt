Item 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries.UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKSSouthern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses, including rates and charges, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices, and the operation of fossil-fuel, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and biomass generating facilities, as well as transmission and distribution facilities. For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by Southern Power Company must be approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates could be affected absent the ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority. Additionally, the respective state PSCs must approve the traditional operating companies' requested rates for retail customers. While the retail rates of the traditional operating companies are designed to provide for the full recovery of costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital), there can be no assurance that a state PSC, in a future rate proceeding, will not attempt to alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is sought or to modify the current authorized rate of return.Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals, and certificates have been obtained for their respective existing operations and that their respective businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address air quality, water, coal combustion residuals, global climate change, renewable energy standards, and other matters and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could negatively impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power.The Southern Company system is subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to adequately protect the environment. Compliance with these environmental requirements requires the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at substantially all of their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power expect that they will continue to be significant in the future. Through 2013, the traditional operating companies had invested approximately $9.4 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with these requirements. The EPA has adopted and is in the process of implementing regulations governing the emission of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the Clean Air Act through the national ambient air quality standards, CAIR, the MATS rule, and other air quality regulations and is in the process of considering additional revisions. In addition, the EPA has proposed additional regulations governing cooling water intake structures and has proposed revisions to the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants under the Clean Water Act. The EPA is also evaluating whether additional regulation of coal combustion I-14Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statementsresiduals (including coal ash and gypsum) is merited under federal solid and hazardous waste laws.Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to air quality, water, coal combustion residuals, global climate change, or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power.In addition, the EPA currently regulates emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration preconstruction permit program and the Title V operating permit program of the Clean Air Act, which both apply to power plants and other commercial and industrial facilities. On January 8, 2014, the EPA  published re-proposed regulations to establish standards of performance for greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel steam electric generating units and is expected to propose standards of performance for modified, reconstructed, and existing units during 2014. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations ; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; and the fuel mix of the electric utilities. Compliance costs may arise from existing unit retirements, installation of additional environmental controls, upgrades to the transmission system, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units. Additionally, if Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions against Alabama Power and Georgia Power and issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and Mississippi Power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered  on a timely basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional operating companies or market-based rates for Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as air quality and water standards, has increased generally throughout the U.S. In particular, personal injury, property damage, and other claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, coal combustion residuals, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters, have become more frequent.The ultimate cost impact of proposed and final legislation and regulations and litigation are likely to result in significant and additional costs and could result in additional operating restrictions. The net income of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be negatively impacted by changes in regulations related to transmission planning processes and competition in the wholesale electric markets. The traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. A small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through the wholesale electric tariff but the majority of transmission revenues are collected through retail rates. New FERC rules pertaining to regional transmission planning and cost allocation present challenges to transmission planning and the wholesale market structure in the Southeast.  The key impacts of these new rules include: •possible disruption of the integrated resource planning processes  within the states in the Southern Company system's service territory;•delays and additional processes for developing transmission plans; and•possible impacts on state jurisdiction of approving, certifying, and pricing of new transmission facilities. The FERC rules related to transmission are intended to spur the development of new transmission infrastructure to promote and I-15Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statementsencourage the integration of renewable sources of supply as well as facilitate competition in the wholesale market by providing more choices to wholesale power customers. In addition to the impacts on transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations also impact power hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges as well as over-the-counter. Finally, technology changes in the power and fuel industries continue to create significant impacts to wholesale transaction cost structures. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power cannot predict the impact of these and other such developments, nor can they predict the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are typically driven by factors beyond their control. The financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be adversely affected by these and other changes. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power could be subject to higher costs as a result of implementing and maintaining compliance with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation mandatory reliability standards along with possible associated penalties for non-compliance.Owners and operators of bulk power systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. If any traditional operating company or Southern Power is found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, such traditional operating company or Southern Power could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. OPERATIONAL RISKSThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of its subsidiaries' electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, particularly with older generating facilities;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •terrorist attacks; •fuel or material supply interruptions; •compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards;•implementation of technologies with which the Southern Company system is developing experience;•information technology system failure; •cyber intrusion; and •catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as influenzas, or other similar occurrences.A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. In addition, an investment in a subsidiary with such generation, transmission, or distribution facilities could be adversely impacted.I-16Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, natural disasters, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage. Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 MWs, or 8.1%, of the Southern Company system's generation capacity as of December 31, 2013. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Due solely to the increase in nuclear generating capacity, the below risks are expected to increase incrementally once Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are operational. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health, and financial risks such as:•the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel;•uncertainties with respect to the on-site storage of and the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel;•uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate reserves for decommissioning;•limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the nuclear operations of Alabama Power and Georgia Power or those of other commercial nuclear facility owners in the United States;•potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities;•significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities, including repairs and upgrades required by the NRC;• the threat of a possible terrorist attack, including a potential cyber security attack; and•the potential impact of a natural disaster. Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance, to minimize the potential financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance with NRC licensing and safety-related requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. As a result of the major earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant, the NRC is performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S., which could potentially impact future operations and capital requirements. The final form and the resulting impact of any changes to safety requirements for nuclear reactors will be dependent on further review and action by the NRC and cannot be determined at this time. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Southern Company system nuclear plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit, prohibit, or require significant changes to the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit that could result in substantial costs. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the United States could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict. I-17Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsPhysical or cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate and could adversely affect financial results and liquidity.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power face the risk of physical and cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation facilities, the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power, and their information technology systems and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees and other confidential information. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power face on-going threats to their assets. Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error or physical or cyber attacks. If the traditional operating companies' or Southern Power's assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not recovered in a timely way, the traditional operating companies or Southern Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the applicable traditional operating company or Southern Power to penalties and claims from third parties.These events could negatively affect the financial results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power through lost revenues, costs to recover and repair damage, and costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and biomass, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate their respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company.The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Each traditional operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates.In addition, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to a greater extent have become more dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. In many instances, the cost of purchased power for the traditional operating companies and Southern Power is influenced by natural gas prices. Historically, natural gas prices have been more volatile than prices of other fuels. In recent years, domestic natural gas prices have been depressed by robust supplies, including production from shale gas, as well as lower demand. These market conditions, together with additional regulation of coal-fired generating units, have increased the traditional operating companies' reliance on natural gas-fired generating units. Natural gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane or a pipeline failure. The availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility may have a material impact on the supply and cost of natural gas.In addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the cost and availability of natural gas, coal, and uranium. I-18Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsThe revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. In addition, the traditional operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs. Even though Southern Power and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit evaluation process and contractual protections, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations and contractual protections take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted. Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured.Changes in technology may make Southern Company's electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power less competitive.A key element of the business models of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation. Broader use of distributed generation by retail electric customers may also result from customers’ changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, there can be no assurance that a state PSC or legislature will not attempt to modify certain aspects of the traditional operating companies’ business as a result of these advances in technology. If these technologies became cost competitive and achieved sufficient scale, the market share of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. It is also possible that rapid advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power. If state PSCs fail to adjust rates to reflect the impact of any changes in loads, increasing self-generation, and the growth of distributed generation, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Southern Company and the traditional operating companies could be materially adversely affected.Acquisitions and dispositions may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions and dispositions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions and dispositions. Southern Power, in particular, continually seeks opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or sales of assets. These transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk. These transactions may also affect the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.These transactions also involve risks, and Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot ensure that:•any acquisitions would result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;•any acquisitions would be successfully integrated into the acquiring company’s operations and internal controls;I-19Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statements•the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or that the acquiring company will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;•any disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow;•use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or•any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions would not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of Southern Company or its subsidiaries.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' results of operations.Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, especially with the workforce needs associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Kemper IGCC construction. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses. If Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies, are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.CONSTRUCTION RISKSSouthern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power require ongoing capital expenditures, including those to meet environmental standards.GeneralThe businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, including those to meet environmental standards. Certain of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, expanding existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects are long-term in nature and in some cases include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. The completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:•shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; •labor costs;•varied productivity and production;•work stoppages; •contractor or supplier delay or non-performance under construction or other agreements or non-performance by other major participants in construction projects;•delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, and other regulatory authorizations;•delays associated with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, system integration, and operations, and/or unforeseen engineering problems;I-20Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statements•impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations; •the outcome of legal challenges to regulatory approvals;•failure to construct in accordance with licensing requirements;•continued public and policymaker support for such projects;•adverse weather conditions; •other unforeseen engineering problems;•changes in project design or scope;•environmental and geological conditions; •delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and•unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor, and increased financing costs as a result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of construction schedule delays. In addition, with respect to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the operation of existing nuclear units, a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units, including any which may be required as a result of the major earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant, which could potentially impact future operations and capital requirements. The final form and the resulting impact of any changes to safety requirements for nuclear reactors will be dependent on further review and action by the NRC and cannot be determined at this time. If a traditional operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. Even if a construction project is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates. In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Construction delays could result in the loss of otherwise available investment tax credits, production tax credits, and other tax incentives. Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income.Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations.The two largest construction projects currently underway in the Southern Company system are the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the Kemper IGCC. I-21Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 constructionSouthern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of and will operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (each, an approximately 1,100 MW AP1000 nuclear generating unit). Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the new units. The NRC certified the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC's Design Certification Document, as amended (DCD), for the AP1000 reactor design, effective December 30, 2011, and issued combined COLs in February 2012. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level, and additional challenges are expected as construction proceeds.Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring (VCM) reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year.  If the projected certified construction capital costs to be borne by Georgia Power increase by 5% or the projected in-service dates are significantly extended, Georgia Power is required to seek an amendment to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate from the Georgia PSC. Accordingly, Georgia Power's eighth VCM report requested an amendment to the certificate to increase the estimated in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and to extend the estimated in-service dates to fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2018 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively.On September 3, 2013, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation entered into by Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC staff to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate, until the commercial operation date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power. In accordance with the Georgia Integrated Resource Planning Act, any costs incurred by Georgia Power in excess of the certified amount will not be included in rate base, unless shown to be reasonable and prudent. In addition, financing costs on any excess construction-related costs potentially would be subject to recovery for allowance for funds used during construction instead of the Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery tariff.Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG Power, and Dalton (collectively, the Owners) and Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Stone & Webster, Inc. (Stone & Webster) (collectively, the Contractor) are involved in litigation regarding the costs associated with design changes to the DCD and delays in the timing of approval of the DCD and issuance of the COLs, including the assertion by the Contractor that the Owners are responsible for these costs and that the Contractor is entitled to further schedule extensions. The portion of the additional costs claimed by the Contractor that would be attributable to Georgia Power (based on Georgia Power's ownership interest) with respect to these issues is approximately $425 million (in 2008 dollars). Georgia Power has not agreed with either the proposed cost or schedule adjustments or that the Owners have any responsibility for costs related to these issues. While litigation has commenced and Georgia Power intends to vigorously defend its positions, Georgia Power also expects negotiations with the Contractor to continue with respect to costs and schedule during which negotiations the parties may reach a mutually acceptable compromise of their positions.Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the DCD and COLs, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensed-based compliance issues are expected to arise as construction proceeds, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs either to the Owners, the Contractor, or both. As construction continues, the risk remains that additional challenges in the fabrication, assembly, delivery, and installation of structural modules, delays in the receipt of the remaining permits necessary for the operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, or other issues could arise and may further impact project schedule and cost. Additional claims by the Contractor or Georgia Power (on behalf of the Owners) are also likely to arise throughout construction. These claims may be resolved through formal and informal dispute resolution procedures under the engineering, procurement, and construction agreement for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, but also may be resolved through litigation.Kemper IGCC constructionIn April 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued a detailed order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper IGCC (2012 MPSC CPCN Order), which the Sierra Club appealed to the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi (Chancery Court). In December 2012, the Chancery Court affirmed the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order. On January 8, 2013, the Sierra Club filed an appeal of the Chancery I-22Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsCourt's ruling with the Mississippi Supreme Court. The ultimate outcome of the CPCN challenge cannot be determined at this time.The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper IGCC included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was $2.4 billion, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 (DOE Grants) and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, and allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) related to the Kemper IGCC. The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. Exceptions to the $2.88 billion cost cap include the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when Mississippi Power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on the ratepayers, relative to the original proposal for the CPCN) (Cost Cap Exceptions), as contemplated in the settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC entered into on January 24, 2013 (Settlement Agreement) and the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order. Recovery of the Cost Cap Exception amounts remains subject to review and approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper IGCC was originally scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014 and is currently scheduled to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2014.Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery or joint owner contributions for any related costs that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions and net of the DOE Grants. Through December 31, 2013, Southern Company and Mississippi Power have recorded pre-tax charges to income for revisions to the cost estimate of $1.2 billion ($729 million after tax). The revised cost estimates through December 31, 2013 reflect increased labor costs, piping and other material costs, start-up costs, decreases in construction labor productivity, the change in the in-service date, and an increase in the contingency for risks associated with start-up activities. Mississippi Power could experience further construction cost increases and/or schedule extensions with respect to the Kemper IGCC as a result of factors including, but not limited to, labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay, or non-performance under construction or other agreements. Furthermore, Mississippi Power could also experience further schedule extensions associated with start-up activities for this "first-of-its-kind" technology, including major equipment failure, system integration, and operations, and/or unforeseen engineering problems, which would result in further cost increases and could result in the loss of certain tax benefits related to bonus depreciation.  In subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs to complete construction of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap will be reflected in Southern Company’s and Mississippi Power’s statements of income and these changes could be material.On January 24, 2013, Mississippi Power entered into the Settlement Agreement with the Mississippi PSC that, among other things, establishes the process for resolving matters regarding cost recovery related to the Kemper IGCC. Under the Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power agreed to limit the portion of prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs to be included in retail rate base to the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, plus the Cost Cap Exceptions, but excluding AFUDC, and any other costs permitted or determined to be excluded from the $2.88 billion cost cap by the Mississippi PSC. The Settlement Agreement also allows Mississippi Power to secure alternate financing for costs that are not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceedings contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. Legislation to authorize a multi-year rate plan and legislation to provide for alternate financing through securitization of up to $1.0 billion of prudently-incurred costs was enacted into law on February 26, 2013. Mississippi Power intends to securitize (1) prudently-incurred costs in excess of the certificated cost estimate and up to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, (2) accrued AFUDC, and (3) other prudently-incurred costs as approved by the Mississippi PSC. The rate recovery necessary to recover the annual costs of securitization is expected to be filed and become effective after the Kemper IGCC is placed in service and following completion of the Mississippi PSC's final prudence review of costs for the Kemper IGCC.The Settlement Agreement provides that Mississippi Power may terminate the Settlement Agreement if certain conditions are not met, if Mississippi Power is unable to secure alternate financing for any prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs not otherwise recovered in any Mississippi PSC rate proceeding contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, or if the Mississippi PSC fails to comply with the requirements of the Settlement Agreement. Mississippi Power continues to work with the Mississippi PSC and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to implement the procedural schedules set forth in the Settlement Agreement and additional variations to the schedule are likely.I-23Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsConsistent with the Settlement Agreement, on March 5, 2013, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (2013 MPSC Rate Order), approving retail rate increases of 15% effective March 19, 2013 and 3% effective January 1, 2014, which collectively are designed to collect $156 million annually beginning in 2014. Amounts collected through these rates are being recorded as a regulatory liability to be used to mitigate customer rate impacts after the Kemper IGCC is placed in service.  On March 21, 2013, a legal challenge to the 2013 MPSC Rate Order was filed by Thomas A. Blanton with the Mississippi Supreme Court, which remains pending against Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC.Also consistent with the Settlement Agreement, on February 26, 2013, Mississippi Power filed with the Mississippi PSC a rate recovery plan for the Kemper IGCC for the first seven years of its operation, along with a proposed revenue requirement under such plan for 2014 through 2020 (Seven-Year Rate Plan). On March 22, 2013, Mississippi Power, in compliance with the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, filed a revision to the Seven-Year Rate Plan with the Mississippi PSC for the Kemper IGCC for cost recovery through 2020, which is still under review by the Mississippi PSC. The revenue requirements set forth in the Seven-Year Rate Plan assume the sale of a 15% undivided interest in the Kemper IGCC to SMEPA and utilization of bonus depreciation as provided by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which currently requires that the Kemper IGCC be placed in service in 2014.In 2014, Mississippi Power plans to amend the Seven-Year Rate Plan  to reflect changes including the revised in-service date, the change in expected benefits relating to tax credits, various other revenue requirement items, and other tax matters, which include ensuring compliance with the normalization requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The impact of these revisions for the average annual retail revenue requirement is estimated to be approximately $35 million through 2020. The amendment to the Seven-Year Rate Plan is also expected to reflect rate mitigation options identified by Mississippi Power that, if approved by the Mississippi PSC, would result in no change to the total customer rate impacts contemplated in the original Seven-Year Rate Plan.Further cost increases and/or schedule extensions with respect to the Kemper IGCC could have an adverse impact on the Seven-Year Rate Plan, such as the inability to recover items considered as Cost Cap Exceptions, potential costs subject to securitization financing in excess of $1.0 billion, and the loss of certain tax benefits related to bonus depreciation. While the Kemper IGCC is scheduled to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2014, any schedule extension beyond 2014 would result in the loss of tax benefits related to bonus depreciation. The estimated value of the bonus depreciation tax benefits to retail customers is approximately $200 million. Loss of these tax benefits would require further adjustment to the Seven-Year Rate Plan and approval by the Mississippi PSC to ensure compliance with the normalization requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.  In the event that the Mississippi PSC does not approve or Mississippi Power withdraws the Seven-Year Rate Plan, Mississippi Power would seek rate recovery through an alternate means, which could include a traditional rate case.The Mississippi PSC’s prudence review of Kemper IGCC costs incurred through March 31, 2013, as provided for in the Settlement Agreement, is expected to occur in the second quarter 2014. A final review of all costs incurred after March 31, 2013 is expected to be completed within six months of the Kemper IGCC’s in-service date. Furthermore, regardless of any prudence determinations made during the construction and start-up period, the Mississippi PSC has the right to make a final prudence determination after the Kemper IGCC has been placed in service.The ultimate outcome of these matters, including the resolution of legal challenges, determinations of prudency, and the specific manner of recovery of prudently-incurred costs, is subject to further regulatory actions and cannot be determined at this time.FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKSThe generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or Southern Power's revenues and increase costs.The generation operations and energy marketing operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in power prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from the sale of power. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. The Southern Company system attempts to mitigate risks associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through the traditional operating companies' fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:•prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, biomass, and other fuels used in the generation facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, including associated transportation costs, and I-24Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statementssupplies of such commodities;•demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available from current or new competitors;•liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market; •weather conditions impacting demand for electricity; •seasonality; •transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;•availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;•forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company system, its competitors, or third party providers;•the financial condition of market participants; •the economy in the service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the impact of economic conditions on demand for electricity and the demand for fuels;•natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism, and other catastrophic events; and•federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases may not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.Historically, the traditional operating companies from time to time have experienced underrecovered fuel cost balances and deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may experience such balances and deficits in the future. While the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through special rate provisions administered by the respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred, and delays in the authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and Southern Company.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power.The consumption and use of energy are fundamentally linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Additionally, any economic downturn could negatively impact  customer growth and usage per customer, thus reducing the sales of electricity and revenues.  Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of electricity. On the customer behavior side, federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional operating companies have PSC mandates to promote energy efficiency. The adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, new electric technologies such as electric vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system's planning processes incorporate estimates of the impacts of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC mandates, and technology, but upside and downside risks remain.All of the factors discussed above could adversely affect Southern Company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or Southern Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.I-25Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsThe operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, significant weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,  droughts, and winter storms, could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power and could negatively impact results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity.Electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, available cash, and borrowing ability of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and/or Southern Power.In addition, volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional operating companies and the generating facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions which could be subject to major storm activity. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from weather events to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generating facilities and other property. In the event a traditional operating company experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC. While the traditional operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently-incurred costs incurred in connection with such an event, any denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's and Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events within the service territory of any traditional operating company or affecting Southern Power's customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for electricity for extended periods. Any significant loss of customers or reduction in demand for electricity could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's or Southern Power's and Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to Southern Company.Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its own. Substantially all of Southern Company's consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company's subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. Southern Company's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Southern Company with funds.A downgrade in the credit ratings of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power Company could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power Company to post collateral or replace certain indebtedness.There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power Company, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other commitments for capital. Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power Company could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power Company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power I-26Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial StatementsCompany, borrowing costs would increase, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts.The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures. These risk management policies, limits, and procedures might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered for hedging purposes might not off-set the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.Demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to determine the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. This planning process must look many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional operating companies may not be able to extend existing PPAs or to find new buyers for existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or it may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and for Southern Company.Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation and transmission facilities.The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional operating companies or Southern Power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities. Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and for Southern Company.Energy conservation and energy price increases could negatively impact financial results.Customers could voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy price, or individual conservation efforts, which could negatively impact the results of operations of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. In addition, a number of regulatory and I-27Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statementslegislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Conservation programs could impact the financial results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in different ways. For example, if any traditional operating company is required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact on such traditional operating company and Southern Company. Certain of the traditional operating companies actively promote energy conservation programs, which have been approved by their respective state PSCs. For certain of such traditional operating companies, regulatory mechanisms have been established that provide for the recovery of costs related to such programs and lost revenues as a result of such programs. However, to the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand beyond what is anticipated, the value of generation assets of the traditional operating companies and/or Southern Power and other unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted and the traditional operating companies could be negatively impacted depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. In addition, the failure of those traditional operating companies who actively promote energy conservation programs to achieve the energy conservation targets established by their respective state PSCs could negatively impact such traditional operating company's ability to recover costs and lost revenues as a result of such progress and ability to receive certain benefits related to such programs.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation and increases in energy prices will have on their respective financial condition or results of operations.The businesses of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions. The inability of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power is not able to access capital at competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain events or market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:•an economic downturn or uncertainty; •bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated energy company, financial institution, or sovereign entity; •capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally; •changes in tax policy such as dividend tax rates;•market prices for electricity and gas; •terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on Southern Company's facilities or unrelated energy companies' facilities;•war or threat of war; or •the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries. In addition, Georgia Power’s ability to make future borrowings through its term loan credit facility with the Federal Financing Bank is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, as well as certification of compliance with the requirements of the I-28Table of Contents                                    Index to Financial Statementsloan guarantee program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, including accuracy of project-related representations and warranties, delivery of updated project-related information and evidence of compliance with the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, as amended, compliance with the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, and certification from the DOE’s consulting engineer that proceeds of the advances are used to reimburse certain costs of construction relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that are eligible for financing under the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust assets or may increase plan costs, which then could require significant additional funding.The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Southern Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy obligations to decommission Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants. The Southern Company system has significant obligations related to pension and postretirement benefit plans. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected return rates. A decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements relating to benefit plan liabilities of the Southern Company system and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear decommissioning obligations. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under pension and postretirement benefit plans of the Southern Company system; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are also facing rising medical benefit costs, including the current costs for active and retired employees. It is possible that these costs may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than anticipated. If the Southern Company system is unable to successfully manage benefit plan assets and medical benefit costs and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are unable to successfully manage the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected.Southern Company may be unable to recover its investment in its leveraged leases if a lessee fails to profitably operate the leased assets.Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, with terms ranging up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. With respect to Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases, the recovery of its investment is dependent on the profitable operation of the leased assets by the respective lessees. A significant deterioration in the performance of the leased asset could result in the impairment of the related lease receivable.Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance.The financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, while Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power maintain an amount of insurance protection that they consider adequate, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies selected by them will cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.Any losses not covered by insurance could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power.
