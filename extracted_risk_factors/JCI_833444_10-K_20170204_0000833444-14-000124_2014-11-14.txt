.    Risk Factors        You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as technological obsolescence, labor relations, geopolitical events, climate change and international operations.Risks Relating to Our Businesses General economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain markets that we serve. For example, demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction, industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending, each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality. Even if demand for our products is not negatively affected, the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis.Much of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects. Commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit. In recent years, many commercial and residential real estate markets have experienced significant fluctuations in supply and demand, and this volatility may continue indefinitely. In addition, most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing from banks and other institutional lenders in order to initiate and complete projects. Declines in real estate values in many parts of the world have led to significant reductions in the availability of project financing, even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction. These factors have in turn hampered demand for new fire detection and suppression and security installations.Levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions, economic conditions within specific industries we serve, expectations of future market behavior and available financing. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders.7Table of ContentsThe businesses of many of our industrial customers, particularly oil and gas companies, chemical and petrochemical companies, mining and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. During such economic downturns, customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects, including greenfield construction, expensive maintenance projects and upgrades. Additionally, demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts, as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning, which may reduce demand for our products and services. Although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers, disruptions in financial markets and banking systems, could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access, and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels. Any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects, including necessary maintenance and upgrades, even during periods of favorable end-market conditions.Many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors, including governmental and institutional customers, have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue, including tax receipts, general obligation and construction bonds, endowments and donations, have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions. These budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers.Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We face competition in each of our businesses, which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products and services. If we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global market-place, our operating results may be adversely affected.We operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers, both domestically and on a global basis. Our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in Asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world. Currently, key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industry-leading products and services, to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully. These factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation, cost reduction, productivity improvement and a regular appraisal of our asset portfolio. If we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader, or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or cost-effectiveness, or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products, services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards. Although many of our largest competitors are also global industrial companies, we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products and services at lower cost than ours, particularly in emerging markets, or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate. We have found that in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers, in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses.Accordingly, our future success depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: adapt our products, services, organization, workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world, particularly in high growth emerging markets; identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end-markets; and develop or acquire, manufacture and bring competitive products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively. Adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address customer demand. Even when we invest in growing our business in local markets, we may not be successful for any number of reasons, including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced more locally at lower cost. Our ability to develop or acquire new products and services can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or services on a timely basis. Moreover, as we introduce new products, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use, 8Table of Contentswhich could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer. In addition, the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate. As a result, the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets, the failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance, the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions, or system failure, than may be inherent in other businesses.If a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure, he or she may pursue legal action against us, and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial. In particular, because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property, we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services. We could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected. The nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our installation, service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances, and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected. However, in the event of litigation with respect to such matters, it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable, that our insurance coverage is not adequate, or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims. As a result, such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business.Our business operates and serves consumers worldwide. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•economic volatility and the impact of economic conditions in various regions;•the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets, especially our intellectual property rights, through non-U.S. legal systems;•possibility of unfavorable circumstances from host country laws, regulations or licensing requirements;•fluctuations in revenues, operating margins and other financial measures due to currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency and earnings repatriation;•trade protection measures, import or export restrictions, licensing requirements and local fire and security codes and standards;•increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of foreign operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences;•issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments;•longer payment cycles;•changes in the general political, social and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;•the threat of nationalization and expropriation, as well as new or changed restrictions regarding foreign ownership of assets - in particular with respect to security products or services that may be viewed by certain governments as sovereign security interests;•the presence of corruption in certain countries; and•fluctuations in available municipal funding in those instances where a project is government financed.One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition.In order to manage our day-to-day operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. In addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network. Our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.9Table of Contents Volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.A significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure have undergone significant devaluation in the past, which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets, reduce the U.S. dollar value of our local cash flow and potentially reduce the U.S. dollar value of future local net income. Although we intend to enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, we are a large buyer of metals and other non-metal commodities, including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet, the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method.We monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations. These hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings. These acquisitions are likely to include businesses in emerging markets, which are often riskier than acquisitions in developed markets.  We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful.Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:•diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;•difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;•inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;•potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or of us;•assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and•dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities.It may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain strategic or operational benefits that are expected from our acquisitions. Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges. A significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets, and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.One aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets, including China, India, Latin America and the Middle East, through both organic investments and through acquisitions. Emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets, where legal systems are more developed and familiar to us. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are more susceptible to corruption, and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the United States. Negative or uncertain political climates and military disruptions in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us.10Table of ContentsWe cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets, including civil unrest, international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. Failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and other information; non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information; or a violation of the Company's privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In the normal course of our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees, including video and other customer data obtained in connection with monitoring and analytical services. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. In addition, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. Increasingly, our security products and services are accessed wirelessly and through the Internet, and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services wirelessly or via the Internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services.Failure to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information and technology networks could adversely affect us.We are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality, acquiring new systems with new functionality and moving to cloud-based technology solutions. These types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may suffer.We purchase materials, components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training, motivating and developing employees, and in particular we strive to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the day-to-day operations of a highly diversified organization. Many of our manufacturing processes, and many of the integrated solutions we offer, are highly technical in nature. Our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain engineers and other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense. Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging 11Table of Contentsmarkets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, unfavorable end-market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. We maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet, and we believe these balances are recoverable. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. Impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis. Future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense.If our residential or commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services, or disconnect for other reasons, our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide. We amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated. If customer disconnect rates were to rise significantly, we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force.We employ over 57,000 people worldwide. Approximately 14% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council. Although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works council, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our monitoring and/or manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect our business.If our operations, particularly at our monitoring facilities and/or manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals, fill 12Table of Contentscustomer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial performance.Interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.We may be unable to execute on our strategic priorities.In connection with the spin-offs of our former North American residential and small business security business and flow control businesses in September 2012, we anticipated certain financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to Tyco, and in particular we commenced certain productivity and other strategic initiatives following the spin-offs intended to reduce complexity, restructure operations and leverage Tyco’s scale in certain areas such as sourcing. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated results of these actions on the scale that we expected, and the anticipated benefits of the spin-offs, and the productivity and other strategic initiatives may not be fully realized.  We and ADT have entered into non-compete and non-solicit restrictions that prohibited us from competing with ADT in the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada, and prohibited ADT from competing with us in the commercial fire and security businesses, in each case until September 29, 2014. The non-compete provisions included in the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-offs have expired. These provisions (i) prohibited us from competing with ADT in the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada and (ii) prohibited ADT from competing with Tyco in the commercial fire and security businesses, subject to certain small business related exceptions, in each case until September 29, 2014. In addition, the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that prevented (i) us from soliciting ADT’s residential small business customers in the United States and Canada and (ii) ADT from soliciting our security customers, in each case until September 29, 2014. These provisions effectively prevented us from expanding into ADT’s business, and ADT from expanding into our business, in these jurisdictions until September 29, 2014. Because these restrictions have expired, ADT is no longer contractually prohibited from competing with us for commercial security customers, especially smaller businesses. ADT has begun to compete with us and, if it is successful in this regard, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results and operations and cash flows. In connection with the 2012 Separation, we re-branded our North American commercial security business to Tyco Integrated Security and we no longer own the right to use the ADT® brand name in the United States and Canada.Prior to the spin-off of ADT in September 2012, we re-branded our North American commercial security business to Tyco Integrated Security. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve name recognition or status under our new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed. The failure of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, resulting in reduced revenues. In addition, as a result of the spin-offs, we own the ADT® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Canada, and ADT owns the brand name in the United States and Canada. Although we have entered agreements with ADT designed to protect the value of the ADT® brand, we cannot assure you that actions taken by ADT will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the United States and Canada. These factors expose us to the risk that the ADT® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control, including ADT's business conduct in the United States and Canada. Any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters We are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In the normal course of our business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior, and litigation related to employee matters, wages and commercial disputes. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. Furthermore, we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage.  The defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our management's attention. In addition, we 13Table of Contentsmay be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install. These claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability.We face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us, such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, and our insurance carriers may deny coverage for claims made by us. Any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In addition, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected. The nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these limitations will be enforced. Losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations.Our operations and employees are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local licensing laws, fire and security codes and standards and other laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business. The loss of such licenses, or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, our systems generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed, and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes, which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions.Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Due to the international scope of our operations, the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and various non U.S. governmental agencies, including applicable export controls, customs, currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations, and laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets. No assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws outside the United States.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production, they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-14Table of Contentscorruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.Furthermore, in September 2012 we agreed to the settlement of charges related to alleged FCPA violations with the DOJ and SEC. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a consent agreement with the SEC and a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and a subsidiary of ours (which is no longer part of Tyco as a result of the 2012 Separation) pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Pursuant to the three-year non-prosecution agreement, we have acknowledged that a number of our subsidiaries made payments, both directly and indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and state-owned entities, and falsely described the payments in the subsidiaries' books, records and accounts. The non-prosecution agreement also acknowledges Tyco's timely, voluntary and complete disclosure to the DOJ, and our cooperation with the DOJ's investigation-including a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconduct-and extensive remediation. Under the non-prosecution and other agreements, we have agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the DOJ and other governmental authorities on matters related to our compliance efforts, including informing the DOJ when we become aware of possible violations of the FCPA as a result of our global audit program, and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect FCPA violations. Notwithstanding our settlement of the DOJ and SEC investigations, we may be subject to allegations of FCPA violations in the future and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of these compliance matters. If so, or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the non-prosecution and other agreements, we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the DOJ or SEC. In such a case, we could be subject to material fines, injunctions on future conduct, the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. From time to time, we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and international trade laws. When we receive information alleging improper activity, our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. and/or foreign laws. Such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and our business prospects.  We are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries, including Yarway Corporation (“Yarway”) and Grinnell LLC (“Grinnell”), along with numerous other third parties, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Over 90% of cases pending against affiliates of the Company have been filed against Yarway or Grinnell, and have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components. Claims filed against Yarway derive from Yarway’s purported use of asbestos-containing gaskets and packing in the sale or distribution of steam valves and traps and from its alleged manufacture of asbestos-containing expansion joint packing. Yarway’s alleged manufacture, distribution and/or sale of asbestos-containing materials ceased by 1988, and Yarway ceased substantially all of its manufacturing, distribution and sales operations in 2003. Claims filed against Grinnell typically allege that it manufactured, sold or distributed valves, gaskets, piping and sprinkler systems containing asbestos. On April 22, 2013, Yarway filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter  11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (“Bankruptcy Court”), and on October 9, 2014, the Company reached an agreement in principle with Yarway and the representatives of current and future Yarway asbestos claimants to fund a section 524(g) trust for the resolution and payment of current and future Yarway asbestos claims. Under the Chapter 11 plan to implement the trust, an asbestos settlement trust (the “Yarway Trust”) that conforms to the provisions of Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code will be established and, on the effective date of the Chapter 11 plan, the Company and Yarway will contribute to the Yarway Trust a total of $325 million in cash (“Settlement Consideration”). In exchange for the Settlement Consideration, the Company and its affiliates will receive the benefit of a release from Yarway and an injunction under section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code permanently enjoining the assertion of Yarway Asbestos Claims against those Parties. The agreement in principle is subject, among other things, to the negotiation and filing of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization for Yarway incorporating the terms of such agreement (the “Plan”), acceptance of the Plan by at least 75% of 15Table of ContentsYarway’s current asbestos claimants voting on such Plan, confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court and approval of the injunction in favor of the Company and its affiliates by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (“District Court”). Although the Company has agreed in principle to the terms of the Plan with representatives of current and future Yarway asbestos claimants, there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to implementation of the Plan will be met, or that the final Plan will reflect all of the terms agreed to in principle. If the Plan were not implemented in accordance with the terms agreed in principle, the Company and its affiliates may not receive the benefit of the injunction described above, and the relief ultimately granted by the Bankruptcy Court may not be satisfactory to Yarway, the Company or its affiliates. A failure to obtain satisfactory relief could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company performed a revised valuation of its non-Yarway asbestos-related liabilities and corresponding insurance assets and recorded a net charge, excluding Yarway, of $240 million. Although the Company’s methodology established a range of estimates of reasonably possible outcomes, the Company recorded its best estimate within such range based upon information known at the time. The Company's estimated gross asbestos liability, excluding Yarway, of $538 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs, and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $245 million. The amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on the Company's strategies for resolving its asbestos claims, currently available information, and a number of estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the identity of defendants, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, amount of insurance, and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Many of these factors are closely linked, such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others, and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the Company's asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries. As a result, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results. If actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded, the cost of resolving such liabilities claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.We have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from other environmental agencies that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:•solvent, oil, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and•structure decontamination and demolition, including asbestos abatement.These projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us.Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.The ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware.16Table of Contents We depend on third-party licenses for our products and services.We rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions and provide critical functionality, particularly in our commercial security business. Because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are, to a certain extent, dependent upon such third parties' ability to maintain or enhance their current products and services, to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities, to develop new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. Further, these third-party technology licenses may not always be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our agreements with third-party vendors are not renewed or the third-party software fails to address the needs of our software products and services, we would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality. We cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software if we lose the license to this software, it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Furthermore, even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need, we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring centers and at our customers' sites, including security system control panels and peripherals, in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, could negatively affect us.We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee, however, that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, we are, from time to time, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities.  Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming, and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies.Police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies, either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance. We have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies, in most cases through contracts with us, which increases the overall cost to customers. If more police departments, whether inside or outside the U.S., were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies, our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.The Company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the United States government.The Company’s customers include many Federal, state and local government authorities. Doing business with the United States government and state and local authorities subjects the Company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the Company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. The Company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If 17Table of Contentsthe Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.Risks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Markets Disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us, our customers and our suppliers, by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of credit.In the normal course of our business, we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs, our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets. In 2009 and 2010, credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable. These factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects, as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses. These disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects. Based on these conditions, our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.Our bank credit agreements contain customary financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt. In addition, the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale-leaseback transactions.Although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of credit facility lenders, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Furthermore, acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.We estimate that our available cash, our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. However, material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Such an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate purposes, including dividend payments;•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;•restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and•increase the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.18Table of Contents We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial health, and may decrease our profitability.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock, the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your percentage ownership in us would decline. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us.Risks Relating to Tax Matters Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.Tyco’s and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular, with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 Separation. We previously disclosed that in connection with U.S. federal tax audits, the IRS has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year. In particular, we have been unable to resolve with the IRS matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions in existence prior to the 2007 Separation. As a result, on June 20, 2013, we received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS asserting that several of our former U.S. subsidiaries owe additional taxes of $883.3 million plus penalties of $154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of Tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time. In addition, we received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately $30 million is expected to be asserted. These amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the IRS position described below is ultimately proved correct. In addition, the adjustments proposed by the IRS are subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with Covidien and TE Connectivity (the "2007 Tax Sharing Agreement") under which Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns.The IRS asserted in the Notices of Deficiency that substantially all of Tyco’s intercompany debt originated during the 1997 - 2000 period should not be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on U.S. income tax returns totaling approximately $2.9 billion. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS proposed adjustments. A trial date has been set for February 2016. We believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, that the IRS positions with regard to these matters is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations, and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate. Furthermore, we believe that Tyco’s income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the tax sharing arrangements are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters, and the impact of that resolution, are uncertain and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In particular, if the IRS is successful in asserting its claim, it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods, totaling approximately $6.6 billion, which is expected to be disallowed by the IRS. We share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.In connection with the 2007 Separation, Tyco entered into the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre-2007 Separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 Separation. As noted above, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 Separation. In the event the 2007 Separation, or certain related transactions, is determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 Separation by Tyco, Covidien, or TE Connectivity, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien, or TE Connectivity as a result thereof. If none of the companies is responsible for such failure, then Tyco, Covidien, and TE Connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the 19Table of Contentssame manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties.If any party to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's tax liabilities. We share responsibility for certain of our, Pentair's and ADT's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the Distribution date.In connection with the Distributions, we entered into the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement with Pentair and ADT that is separate from the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and which governs the rights and obligations of Tyco, ADT and Pentair for certain tax liabilities before the Distributions, including Tyco's obligations under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. Under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement Tyco, Pentair and ADT share (i) certain pre-Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to ADT's U.S., Tyco Flow Control's and Tyco's income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, excluding approximately $175 million of pre-2012 Separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 Separation (collectively, "Shared Tax Liabilities"). Tyco will be responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair and ADT will share 42% and 58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Tyco, Pentair and ADT will share 52.5% 20% and 27.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20%, 27.5%, and 52.5% by Pentair, ADT and Tyco, respectively. As of September 28, 2012, Tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 Tax Sharing Arrangement which is recorded in Other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet with an offset to Tyco shareholders' equity. In addition, we entered into a non-income tax sharing agreement with ADT in connection with the ADT Distribution. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods.The 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement provides that, if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure of the Distributions to be tax free (such taxes, as defined in the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, "Distribution Taxes"), each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Pentair's and ADT's tax liabilities. If the Distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or both ADT and Pentair could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Tyco has received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distributions to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distributions will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and/or 361 of the Code, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of ADT common stock or of Pentair common shares. The private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions will qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter ruling, Tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the Distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Pentair and ADT regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters.Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership (which might take into account changes in Pentair stock ownership resulting from the Merger) or asset ownership after the Distributions. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the opinions will be based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with 20Table of Contentsretroactive effect. If the Distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable, the Distributions could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and you could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Pentair common shares and the shares of ADT common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we, Pentair or ADT could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions are taxable.In addition, under the terms of the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the Distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the Distributions by us, Pentair or ADT, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Pentair or ADT as a result thereof. If such failure is not the result of actions taken after the Distributions by us, Pentair or ADT, then we, Pentair and ADT will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that any party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay Distribution Taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of the Distributions because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted as a result of the Distributions in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Distributions. Even if the Distributions otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level gain to Tyco and certain of its affiliates under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our shares, Pentair's shares or ADT's shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distributions. Any acquisitions or issuances of our shares, Pentair's shares or ADT's shares within two years after the Distributions generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan, although we, Pentair or ADT may be able to rebut that presumption.To preserve the tax-free treatment to us of the Distributions, under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement that we entered with Pentair and ADT, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Distributions and related transactions from being tax-free. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement also provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on Pentair or any of its affiliates or on ADT or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the Distributions or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Distributions by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of IncorporationThe anticipated benefits of our change in jurisdiction of incorporation may not be realized.At a special general meeting held on September 9, 2014, our shareholders approved a merger agreement, dated May 30, 2014, between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland, as described in more detail in the proxy statement / prospectus mailed to shareholders on August 1, 2014 related to the merger. We expect this merger to close in November 2014. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the merger, and our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Legislative action in the United States could materially and adversely affect us.Tax-Related LegislationLegislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim, override tax treaties upon which we rely, or otherwise affect the taxes that the United States imposes on our worldwide operations. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and/or require us to take further action, at potentially significant expense, to seek to preserve our effective tax rate. In addition, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability, currently as a Swiss company and in the near future as an Irish company, to take advantage of tax treaties with the United States, we could incur additional tax expense and/or otherwise incur business detriment. 21Table of ContentsLegislation Relating to Governmental ContractsVarious U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.Your rights as a shareholder will change as a result of the Merger.The completion of the merger between the Company and Tyco Ireland will change the governing law that applies to our shareholders from Swiss law (which applies to the Company and its common shares) to Irish law (which applies to Tyco Ireland and its ordinary shares). Many of the principal attributes of Tyco International Ltd. common shares and Tyco Ireland ordinary shares will be materially similar. However, when the merger is completed, your future rights as a shareholder under Irish corporate law will differ from your current rights as a shareholder under Swiss corporate law. In addition, Tyco Ireland’s proposed articles of association will differ from Tyco International Ltd.’s articles of association and organizational regulations. See “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders” in the proxy statement / prospectus related to the merger for more details. Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, Tyco Ireland will be governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Tyco International plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.Our effective tax rate may increase.Although we expect that the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland will not have a material effect on our worldwide effective tax rate, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate, including the potential legislative actions described in these risk factors and our effective tax rate may increase. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate.Tyco Ireland will seek Irish High Court approval of the creation of distributable reserves. Tyco Ireland expects this will be forthcoming but cannot guarantee this.Under Irish law, dividends may only be paid (and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded) out of “distributable reserves,” which Tyco Ireland will not have immediately following the closing of the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland. The creation of distributable reserves of Tyco Ireland by way of a capital reduction of Tyco Ireland requires the approval of the Irish High Court. The approval of the Irish High Court is expected within approximately six to twelve weeks following the closing of the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland. We are not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves. However, the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court. Approval of the creation of distributable reserves by the Irish High Court may also take substantially longer than we anticipate. In the event that distributable reserves of Tyco Ireland are not created, no distributions by way of dividends, share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under Irish law until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities.Transfers of Tyco Ireland ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.For the majority of transfers of Tyco Ireland ordinary shares, there will not be any Irish stamp duty. However, Irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfers occurring after completion of the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland. A transfer of Tyco Ireland ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially (i.e. 22Table of Contentsthrough DTC) to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to Irish stamp duty (unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares). A transfer of Tyco Ireland ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly (i.e. not through DTC) to any buyer, or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. A shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to Tyco Ireland’s transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and, at the time of the transfer, there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares.Because of the potential Irish stamp duty on transfers of Tyco Ireland ordinary shares, we strongly recommend that all directly registered Tyco International Ltd. shareholders open broker accounts so they can transfer their shares into a broker account as soon as possible, and in any event prior to completion of the merger with Tyco Ireland. We also strongly recommend that any person who wishes to acquire Tyco Ireland ordinary shares after completion of the merger acquire such shares as a beneficial holder.We currently intend to pay, or cause one of our affiliates to pay, stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially. In other cases Tyco Ireland may, in its absolute discretion, pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty. Tyco Ireland’s Memorandum and Articles of Association as they will be in effect after the merger provide that, in the event of any such payment, Tyco Ireland (i) may seek reimbursement from the buyer, (ii) may have a lien against the Tyco Ireland ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and (iii) may set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares. Parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in Tyco Ireland ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by Tyco Ireland.Dividends you receive may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. Whether Tyco Ireland will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax from dividends paid to a shareholder will depend largely on whether that shareholder is resident for tax purposes in a “relevant territory.” A list of the “relevant territories” is included as Annex C to the proxy statement/prospectus related to the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland.Dividends received by you could be subject to Irish income tax.Dividends paid in respect of Tyco Ireland’s ordinary shares generally will not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Tyco Ireland.Tyco Ireland shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Tyco.If Tyco Ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in Tyco Ireland’s securities may be disrupted.The facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. Upon the completion of the merger between Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Ireland, Tyco Ireland ordinary shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. Tyco Ireland has entered into arrangements with DTC whereby Tyco Ireland will agree to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for Tyco Ireland’s ordinary shares.DTC is not obligated to accept Tyco Ireland ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities at the closing and, even if DTC does initially accept Tyco Ireland ordinary shares, it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for Tyco Ireland ordinary shares. If DTC determines at any time after the completion of the merger that Tyco Ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe Tyco Ireland ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and trading in Tyco Ireland ordinary shares would be disrupted. While Tyco Ireland would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Tyco Ireland ordinary shares.23Table of ContentsItem 1B
