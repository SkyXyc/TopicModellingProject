Portfolio Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality.




Our executives regularly review and analyze:

 





●  


The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and








●  


The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.







We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:








●  


Generate higher returns;








●  


Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;








●  


Extend our average remaining lease term; or








●  


Decrease tenant or industry concentration.







At December 31, 2011, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $2.2 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2012, we intend to employ more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio.  As a result, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $25 million and $60 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties.




Universal Shelf Registration

In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which expires in March 2012. In accordance with the SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration.




$425 Million Acquisition Credit Facility

We have a $425 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. The initial term of the credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options. Under the credit facility, the current investment grade credit ratings on our debt securities provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling.  We also have other interest rate options available to us under the credit facility.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation. At December 31, 2011, we had a borrowing capacity of $187.6 million available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $237.4 million.  As a result of the issuance of our Class F preferred stock in February 2012, we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on February 7, 2012.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at December 31, 2011 was 2.1% per annum. We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility. At December 31, 2011, we remain in compliance with these covenants.




We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $200 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $625 million.  Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility.

Table of contents




We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.




Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings.  We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have "stable" outlooks.




Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.




In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 50 basis points for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 30 basis points for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.




We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.




The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.




Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2011, we have $67.2 million of mortgages payable to third-party lenders that were assumed in 2011, in connection with our property acquisitions.  We paid $279,000 in principal payments on these mortgages payable during 2011.  Additionally, net premiums totaling $820,000, in aggregate, were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages payable at the time of the respective property acquisitions to account for above-market interest rates.  We recorded amortization of $189,000 related to these net premiums during 2011.




Our mortgages payable are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are non-recourse.  We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so.  We intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness.




No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in "variable interest entities" or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments. Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off-balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.

Competitive Strategy

We believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:

 





●  


Type of Investment Properties: We believe net-leased properties, whether purchased individually or as part of larger portfolio purchases, represent an attractive investment opportunity in today's real estate environment. The less intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our freestanding properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these tenants, our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease arrangement, allows the commercial enterprise to free up capital.











●  


Investment in New Industries: We will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive. When analyzing new industries, we seek to acquire properties that are critical to the success of a commercial enterprise, through its distribution of the product or service. Other characteristics may include, but are not limited to, industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national store operators and other commercial enterprises can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.











●  


Diversification: Diversification of the portfolio by industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31, 2011, we owned a diversified property portfolio that consisted of 2,634 properties located in 49 states, leased to 136 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 38 industry segments. Each of the 38 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 17.2% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.











●  


Management Specialization: We believe that our management's specialization in acquiring and managing single-tenant properties, operated under net-lease agreements, purchased individually or as part of a larger portfolio, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.











●  


Technology: We intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to carry out our operations efficiently and economically. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio's performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology and information-based systems play an important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION




At December 31, 2011, we owned a diversified portfolio:








●  


Of 2,634 properties;








●  


With an occupancy rate of 96.7%, or 2,547 properties leased and only 87 properties available for lease;








●  


Leased to 136 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 38 separate industries;








●  


Located in 49 states;








●  


With over 27.3 million square feet of leasable space; and








●  


With an average leasable space per property of approximately 10,400 square feet.







At December 31, 2011, of our 2,634 properties, 2,533 were leased under net-lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.




In order to more accurately reflect our exposure to various industries, the following industry table has been modified from similar tables we have prepared in the past to reflect the changes below:








●  


Properties previously included in the “distribution and office” industry were reclassified to the “home improvement,” “convenience store,” and “restaurant” industries, to better reflect the industry in which the tenant operates;








●  


The “restaurant” industry was separated into the “restaurants - casual dining” industry, which includes dinner houses and family restaurants, and the “restaurants - quick service” industry, which includes fast food restaurants;








●  


The “equipment rental” industry was renamed “equipment services;”








●  


The “travel plazas” industry was renamed “transportation services;” and








●  


The “wine and spirits” industry was renamed “beverages.”

In order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties.  The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.

We face competition in the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:

 





●  


Businesses;








●  


Individuals;








●  


Fiduciary accounts and plans; and








●  


Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.




 

Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.




Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.

Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:

 





●  


Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;








●  


Inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;








●  


Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;








●  


Declines in our tenants' creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators;








●  


Defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;








●  


Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and








●  


Deterioration of physical condition of our properties.




 

At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us.




If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties.  Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.




Further, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness.

Eighty-seven of our properties were available for lease or sale at December 31, 2011, all but one of which were single-tenant properties. At December 31, 2011, 33 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. During 2011, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.




For the fourth quarter of 2011, our tenants in the “convenience stores” industry accounted for 17.2% of our rental revenue. A downturn in this industry, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the United States, could adversely affect tenants in this industry, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.




We believe that the ongoing economic recession has also had an adverse effect on many casual dining restaurants, such as our tenants, Friendly Ice Cream Corporation and Buffets Holdings, Inc.  Both of these tenants filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the impact of bankruptcy filings by these or other tenants in the casual dining industry could, as described in the immediately preceding sentence, adversely affect us. Individually, each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011. Nevertheless, downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock.  In addition, we may in the future make additional investments in the “convenience stores” industry, which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues, thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us.




In addition, a substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain upper-market retail and other commercial enterprises, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national or international economy.




Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net-lease retail locations in the United States. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the United States and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses. For example, our acquisitions in 2011 included distribution properties, office properties, and manufacturing properties leased to tenants in a range of non-retail businesses.  These risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates, limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of any non-U.S. jurisdiction.




As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.

Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:








●  


Our knowledge of the contamination;








●  


The timing of the contamination;








●  


The cause of the contamination; or








●  


The party responsible for the contamination of the property.







There may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.

Table of contents




The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.




In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.




It is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would reduce our cash available for distribution. In addition, exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise.




Compliance.  We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties. In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state and local laws relating to ACMs. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.




Insurance and Indemnity.  In June 2005, we entered into a seven-year environmental insurance policy, or the June 2005 policy, which expires on June 1, 2012 on our property portfolio which replaced the previous five-year environmental insurance policy. The limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence, and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $40,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for properties with underground storage tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for all other properties.




Additionally, in December 2009, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy that expires in December 2019 that will initially act in an excess capacity to our June 2005 policy.  On June 1, 2012, this policy will become our primary environmental policy with the same limits as the June 2005 policy, except that once we pay a total of $1 million for self insurance retention, there will be a $50,000 per loss maintenance fee, rather than the $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for general environmental claims.




It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties.  For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.

Commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.




Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.




For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).




In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.




If we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:








●  


We would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;








●  


We would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders;








●  


We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;








●  


We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and








●  


This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.







Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. Our subsidiary, Crest, is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property.




Distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.

To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.




In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.





 





  



-23-







Table of contents




We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.




Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.

Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.




We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.

We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $425 million acquisition credit facility. At December 31, 2011, we had $237.4 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, a total of $1.75 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities and $67.8 million of outstanding mortgage debt. As a result of the issuance of our Class F preferred stock in February 2012, we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on February 7, 2012. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our acquisition credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing financial crisis in Europe (which relates primarily to concerns that certain European countries may be unable to repay their national debt), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money.




In addition, our acquisition credit facility contains provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  In particular, our acquisition credit facility provides that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:

 





●  


The sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit facility) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period, and








●  


The minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,







except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock. The acquisition credit facility further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that has guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meets a significance test set forth in the credit facility, we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock.  If any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, could limit the amount of distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those distributions altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.

Table of contents




Our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock, including:








●  


Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;








●  


Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;








●  


Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;








●  


Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and








●  


Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.







If we default under a mortgage loan, we will automatically be in default of any other loan that has cross-default provisions, and we may lose the properties securing these loans.




Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.




The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:








●  


Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;








●  


The market for similar securities issued by other REITs;








●  


General economic and financial market conditions;








●  


The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;








●  


Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;








●  


Changes in our credit ratings; and








●  


Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.







In addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock in the U.S. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market price of our common stock has also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.




Real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.

We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate.  In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:








●  


Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;








●  


Changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;








●  


Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;








●  


Competition for tenants;








●  


Changes in market rental rates;
































































 



  



-25-







Table of contents



 































●  


Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;








●  


Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;








●  


Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;








●  


Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;








●  


Uninsured property liability;








●  


Property damage or casualty losses;








●  


Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;








●  


The need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;








●  


Physical or weather-related damage to properties;








●  


The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;








●  


Acts of terrorism and war; and








●  


Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.





An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.




In addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry, we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities," but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.




Property taxes may increase without notice.

The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.




We depend on key personnel.

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net-lease industry.




Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.

Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or U.S. businesses. These attacks, or armed conflicts, may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants.




If events like these were to occur, they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.

Over the last several years, the United States stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. In addition, the ongoing financial crisis in Europe (which relates primarily to concerns that certain European countries may be unable to pay their national debt) has had a similar effect. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Unrest in certain Middle Eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets.  Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.




Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants' ability to pay rent.




Current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.

Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.




Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

The SEC is currently considering whether issuers in the U.S. should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  IFRS is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance.  If the SEC decides to require IFRS, it expects that U.S. issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or 2016, although the timeframe has not been finalized.  Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, is considering various changes to GAAP, some of which may be significant, as part of a joint effort with the IASB to converge accounting standards.  Although the FASB and IASB currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases, the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current GAAP.  If IFRS is adopted, the potential issues associated with lease accounting, along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with IFRS, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
