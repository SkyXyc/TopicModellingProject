Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler"). Wahler was a producer of exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") valves, EGR tubes and thermostats, and had operations in Germany, Brazil, the U.S., China and Slovakia. The Wahler acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's strategic position as a producer of complete EGR systems and create additional market opportunities in both passenger and commercial vehicle applications.The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies.In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean-burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.DrivetrainThe Drivetrain Segment develops and manufactures products for automatic transmissions and all-wheel drive ("AWD") vehicles. Precise controls, better response times and minimal parasitic losses, all of which improve fuel economy and vehicle performance, are the core design features of the Drivetrain Segment's product portfolio. The Drivetrain Segment's products include friction, mechanical and controls products for automatic transmissions and torque management products for AWD vehicles. Friction and mechanical products for automatic transmissions include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products for automatic transmissions feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China. The Drivetrain Segment has led the globalization of today's dual clutch transmission ("DCT") technology for over 10 years. BorgWarner's award-winning DualTronic® technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and driving experience of a manual gearbox.The Drivetrain Segment established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its DualTronic® innovations with VW/Audi, followed by program launches with Ford and BMW. In 2007, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan. In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture. In 2013, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first DCT application in a Chinese transmission with SAIC. The Drivetrain Segment is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world.The Drivetrain Segment's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)-AWD transfer case systems, FWD-AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Drivetrain Segment's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit fuel economy and vehicle dynamics.6  Table of Contents                                        Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles, and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Drivetrain Segment's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD®), chain-driven, gear-driven, Pre-Emptive, Part-Time, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Drivetrain Segment's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks.The Drivetrain Segment is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels as traction is required. The Drivetrain Segment's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (“CEH”) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD-AWD vehicles including the Audi A3, Range Rover Evoque, Volvo XC60 and VW Tiguan.In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition adds industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products and enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs. 7  Table of Contents                                       Joint VenturesAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had nine joint ventures in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from the six joint ventures in which the Company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the Company's results. Results from the three joint ventures in which the Company's effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by the Company using the equity method of accounting.Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the Company's respective joint venture partners.

Ltd. by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner, Jayant Dave. The former joint venture was formed in 1996 to develop and manufacture glow plugs in India. After this transaction, the Company owns 100% of the entity.Financial Information About Geographic AreasDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 76% of the Company's consolidated net sales were outside the United States ("U.S."), attributing sales to the location of production rather than the location of the customer. Refer to Note 19, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas. Product Lines and CustomersDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 83% of the Company's net sales were for light-vehicle applications; approximately 8% were for commercial vehicle applications; approximately 5% 8  Table of Contents                                       were for off-highway vehicle applications; and approximately 4% were to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts. The Company’s worldwide net sales to the following customers (including their subsidiaries) were approximately as follows: Year Ended December 31,Customer2014 2013 2012Volkswagen17% 16% 17%Ford13% 14% 13%No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in any of the years  presented.The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.Sales and MarketingEach of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a businesses' products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers. In addition, sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities where appropriate. SeasonalityOur operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.Research and DevelopmentThe Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses.In addition, each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (“R&D”) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.9  Table of Contents                                       By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.  Year Ended December 31,(millions of dollars)2014 2013 2012Gross R&D expenditures$392.8 $350.4 $309.3Customer reimbursements(56.6) (47.2) (43.4)Net R&D expenditures$336.2 $303.2 $265.9Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 4.0%, 4.1% and 3.7% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded 5% of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.Intellectual PropertyThe Company has more than 5,100 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's business.  CompetitionThe Company's reporting segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Technological innovation, application engineering development, quality, price, delivery and program launch support are the primary elements of competition.10  Table of Contents                                       The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:Product Type: Engine Names of CompetitorsTurbochargers: Cummins Turbo Technology IHI  Honeywell Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)     Emissions systems: Mahle T.RAD  Denso Pierburg  Bosch NGK     Timing devices and chains: Denso Schaeffler Group  Iwis Tsubaki Group     Thermal systems: Horton/Sachs Usui  Mahle Xuelong Product Type: Drivetrain Names of CompetitorsTorque transfer: American Axle JTEKT  GKN Driveline Magna Powertrain     Transmission: Bosch FCC  Dynax Schaeffler GroupIn addition, a number of the Company's major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products that compete with the Company's products. Other current OEM customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company's business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.For many of its products, the Company's competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. Also, see .    Risk Factors     The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Risks related to our industryConditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OEMs.We face strong competition.We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Although OEMs have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our business.14  Table of Contents                                       Risks related to our businessWe are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products.There is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Annual price reductions to OEM customers are a permanent component of our business. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. Inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.We continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.  We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases. The discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business. From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers.  If these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.  We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce these rights, could adversely affect our business and our competitive position. We are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems.To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations.  If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.15  Table of Contents                                       A failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our IT systems and infrastructure. IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyber-attacks or failures in third-party-provided services. Disruptions and attacks on our IT systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our third-party data. As a result, such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages. This could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately adversely affect our business.Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide.  Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.Part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.As of December 31, 2014, approximately 18% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our New York facility. This agreement expires in September 2016. The workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. A prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.We are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded.We sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations, if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, our required cash payments may be higher than we expect.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 2010 Act), was signed into law in March 2010. As the 2010 Act evolves, we continue to evaluate its effect, including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans. We are subject to extensive environmental regulations.Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure  that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. Costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.16  Table of Contents                                       We have liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, litigation and other claims.We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws.We provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability, environmental and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate.Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.We have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws could also adversely affect our business. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate. In addition, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.Changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business.Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect  our operating results. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.17  Table of Contents                                       Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.We have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions.  We may not meet our goal because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; (c) and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components.We expect to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities, enhance our customer base, geographic representation, and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities, some of which could be material. While we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.We are subject to risks related to our international operations.We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the Americas, Europe and Asia. For 2014, approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales were outside the U.S. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging, burdensome and expensive. The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  Significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business.Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions.Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive supply market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability 18  Table of Contents                                       to gain or hold market share. In addition, our business in China is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.A downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded.  The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement.  Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.We could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.    We have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, and enhance treasury management flexibility. We may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business.Risks related to our customersWe rely on sales to major customers.We rely on sales to OEMs around the world of varying credit quality. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the Company. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, a customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.Some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2014 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of our 2014 consolidated net sales.    We are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations.All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at OEMs' facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.19  Table of Contents                                       Risks related to our suppliersWe could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations. However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, “Acts of God," or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. This could adversely affect our customer relations and business.Suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. We cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business. We are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers.The Company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers' compensation claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services. These service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company's business.  Insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business.We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts.20  Table of Contents                                       Other risksA variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of fire, flood or other natural disasters.Item 1B
