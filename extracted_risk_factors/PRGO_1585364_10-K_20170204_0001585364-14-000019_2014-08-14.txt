. Risk Factors.All facilities where Rx and OTC drugs are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located. All of the Company’s drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that the Company’s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to store brand customers or to regulatory action against the Company related to the products made in that facility, including suspension of or delay in ANDA approvals, seizure, injunction or recall. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the Company that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the Company’s products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. In addition, several bills have been introduced in Congress that could, if enacted, affect the manufacture and marketing of Rx and OTC drugs. The Company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the Company’s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the Company’s business.The Company submits a Drug Master File ("DMF") for active pharmaceutical ingredients to be commercialized in the U.S. The DMF filings provide an efficient mechanism for FDA review while protecting the Company’s proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The manufacturing facilities are inspected by the FDA to assess cGMP compliance. The manufacturing facilities and production procedures utilized must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. For European markets, the Company submits a European DMF and, where applicable, obtains a certificate of suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. The manufacturing facilities and production procedures for API marketed in Europe must meet EU-GMP and European Pharmacopeia standards.Infant Formula - The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has program responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether the infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The specific requirements for infant formula are governed by the Infant Formula Act. The purpose of the Infant Formula Act is to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum, and in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.Once an infant formula product is formulated, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation before marketing the infant formula. The FDA has established requirements for certain labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control procedures (to  16assure the nutrient content of infant formulas), as well as for company records and reports. A manufacturer must notify the FDA 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. The FDA recently issued a final rule regarding good manufacturing practices, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records, for the production of infant formulas. The Company actively monitored this process and is making appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance. In addition, as part of its responsibility to implement the provisions of the FFDCA, the FDA continuously monitors infant formula products. The FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life, to keep records on production, testing and distribution of each batch of infant formula and to use current good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures. In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which are reviewed to reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula. The FDA also inspects new facilities during early production runs. As part of the inspection, the FDA collects and analyzes samples of infant formula.Dietary Supplements - The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA") amended the FFDCA to, among other things: (1) define dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, (2) require ingredient and nutrition labeling for dietary supplements, (3) permit "structure/function" statements for dietary supplements, (4) permit the display of certain published literature where supplements are sold, (5) authorize the FDA to establish GMPs specifically for dietary supplements, and (6) require the submission of New Dietary Ingredient notification to the FDA.The DSHEA provides specific nutrition labeling requirements for dietary supplements that are slightly different than those for conventional foods. All supplements must bear a "Supplement Facts" box, which lists all of the supplement’s dietary ingredients using nomenclature as specified by FDA regulation. DSHEA also permits dietary supplements to bear statements (1) claiming a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease, provided the prevalence of the disease in the U.S. is disclosed, (2) describing the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, (3) characterizing the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, and (4) describing general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient. The Company is subject to regulations published by the FDA clarifying the types of "structure function" statements permissible in dietary supplement labeling. Such statements cannot expressly or implicitly state that a dietary supplement has any effect on a "disease."  As with foods in general, dietary supplement labeling may include a "health claim," which characterizes the role of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition. On June 25, 2007, the FDA issued Final GMP Regulations specific to Dietary Supplements, which became effective as they relate to the Company on June 25, 2008. The Company continues to invest in its Dietary Supplement operations to ensure compliance with the regulations. The Company continuously monitors FDA activities, including publicly available inspection reports of other companies' inspections, to ensure that its operations and quality systems are maintained in a state of compliance based on the current interpretation of the regulations. The Company has not yet been inspected and cannot determine with certainty what effects the FDA's future interpretations of the regulations will have on its business. The GMP regulations and FDA's future interpretations of these regulations could, among other things, require expanded documentation of the manufacturing processes for certain products or additional analytical testing for certain ingredients. In addition, several bills have been introduced in Congress that could, if enacted, affect the manufacture and marketing of dietary supplements. The Company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the Company's activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the Company's business.The DSHEA requires that the FDA be notified at least 75 days in advance of the introduction of a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was introduced to market after October 15, 1994 or was present in the food supply in a form where the food had not been chemically altered. The notification must provide information establishing that the dietary supplement containing the dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.Food Safety Modernization Act - Portions of the Nutritionals segment's business are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which became law in 2011. The stated purpose of the FSMA is to ensure U.S. foods are safe by shifting the focus from containment of contamination to prevention. The law mandates  17comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. It also gives the FDA mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers. The FSMA impacts food and food ingredient imports through a supplier verification program. Under the FSMA, the FDA is also taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of an outbreak. The FDA has yet to issue a complete set of regulations under the FSMA. Additional clarity is expected once the regulations are finalized.U.S. Department of AgricultureThe Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic". The Company's infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the USDA National Organic Program for the production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products. The Company's infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyPet Care Products - The EPA is responsible for the regulation of companion animal flea and tick products that are applied and act topically. The active ingredients in flea and tick products are pesticides that are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.  Pesticides cannot be distributed or sold in the U.S. unless they are registered with the EPA.The EPA may grant a pesticide registration to an applicant after making a determination that the use of the pesticide product will meet the statutory requirement that it will not cause "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment", i.e., the product will not present an unreasonable risk. An applicant must demonstrate that a pesticide product meets the safety and efficacy standards required by EPA by submitting an extensive battery of toxicology and efficacy studies, or by providing reference to pre-existing data for the evaluation of possible risks to both humans and the animals that may be exposed to the pesticide product. The EPA will not approve a product if there is any reason to doubt that the product can be used safely and efficaciously.When the EPA issues a registration for a pesticide product, the EPA approves the precise formula for the product and the language in the product labeling. It is a violation of U.S. law for a company to distribute or sell a pesticide product that deviates from the formulation composition and label language approved by the EPA. The EPA and state regulators conduct cooperative compliance programs to monitor pesticide products and if necessary, take appropriate enforcement actions.In addition to the registration process, the EPA conducts a registration review program that periodically re-evaluates pesticides that the EPA has approved. New studies may be required, additional safety and use restrictions may be mandated, and, if the EPA decides that a product no longer meets the required safety and efficacy standards, the EPA can cancel the product registration.  Companies that hold pesticide product registrations must report any adverse events that may result from the use of the products. The EPA reviews these reports and may take action to modify or withdraw a registration if the EPA decides that such action is necessary to ensure that the pesticide products meet the stringent safety and efficacy standards mandated by law.   U.S. Drug Enforcement AdministrationThe DEA regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, such as morphine, hydromorphone, opium, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, security and distribution. Recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received, manufactured, stored and distributed, as well as yield losses. Companies handling either controlled substances or List I chemicals are also required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders, thefts and significant losses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 18The Company is subject to the requirements of the CSA and DEA regulations in the handling of any controlled substances in schedules II – V or any of the List I chemicals. Specifically, the Company is subject to regulation in the commercial manufacture and distribution of products containing the List I drug pseudoephedrine and products containing the schedule II drugs morphine, hydromorphone and opium. As a result of a series of amendments to the CSA, the DEA has imposed increased restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products. For example, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 was enacted to authorize the DEA to monitor transactions involving chemicals that may be used illegally in the production of methamphetamine. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 establishes certain registration and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers of OTC cold, allergy, asthma and diet medicines that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine ("PPA"). While certain of the Company’s OTC drug products contain pseudoephedrine, which is a common ingredient in nasal decongestant products, the Company’s U.S. products contain neither ephedrine nor PPA.In addition, the Reauthorization Act of 2005, signed into law on March 9, 2006, prevented the existing provisions of the Patriot Act from expiring and also included the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This law further amended the CSA and provided additional requirements with respect to the manufacture, distribution and sale of pseudoephedrine products. Among the various provisions, this national legislation places certain restrictions on the purchase and sale of all products that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or PPA (List I chemical products). The CSA also imposed import and procurement quotas for List I chemicals, including pseudoephedrine.The CSA, as amended, also imposed daily restrictions on the amount of List I chemical products a retailer may sell to a consumer (3.6 grams per day) and limitations on the amount of List I chemical products a consumer may purchase (9.0 grams) over a 30-day period. Further, effective September 30, 2006, the CSA requires that (a) retail sellers maintain a logbook that tracks the sales of List I chemical products to individuals, and (b) purchasers provide valid identification in order to purchase List I chemical products. Many states have also enacted legislation regulating the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products. The Company is subject to these state requirements as well.Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Other Drug Pricing ProgramsU.S. law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must enter into a rebate agreement with the U.S. government to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. A U.S. federal government agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), is responsible for administering the Medicaid rebate agreements between the U.S. government and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Rebates are due on the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations, as well as under fee-for-service arrangements.Drug manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate agreements, which are between each manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, provide that the drug manufacturer will remit rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by manufacturers to CMS, including Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP"), which is reported on a monthly and quarterly basis, and, in the case of innovator products, best price, which is reported on a quarterly basis. Health reform legislation changed the definition of AMP effective the fourth quarter of calendar 2010. Pursuant to the same legislation, effective for rebate periods beginning with the first quarter of calendar 2010, the rebate formulas used to determine the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows: for noninnovator products, in general generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter; for innovator products, in general brand-name products marketed under NDAs, the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the Best Price for that same quarter. Manufacturers also pay an additional rebate on innovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation. The Company has a Medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the U.S. government. U.S. Federal and/or state governments have and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public, including the enactment in December 2003 of Medicare legislation that expanded the scope of Medicare coverage to include outpatient drugs (Part D), starting in January 2006, as well as health reform legislation enacted in 2010. Management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the Company’s profitability. Various states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on Medicaid  19utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer’s U.S. federal Medicaid agreement. States also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non-Medicaid populations, known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs. These rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the U.S. federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated. Although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs, for the Company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to quarterly Medicaid drug rebate obligations.  As described herein, CMS rules require pharmaceutical companies to calculate and report the AMP to CMS on a monthly as well as a quarterly basis. In addition to using this information to calculate rebates, CMS is preparing to use AMP to calculate a type of U.S. federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multiple source drugs to pharmacies under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limit ("FUL"). Prior to using AMP, CMS typically used pricing data from third-party compendia, such as the Average Wholesaler Price ("AWP") or Wholesaler Acquisition Cost ("WAC"), in the calculation of FULs. Health reform legislation enacted in 2010 amended the statutory definition of AMP and also amended the definition of "multiple source drug" in a manner that materially affects the calculation of FULs.CMS has begun posting draft AMP-based FUL reimbursement files on the CMS website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation. Currently, the FUL reimbursement files are for review and comment only; however, CMS has announced that it plans to publish final FULs after a period of releasing them in draft format. CMS issued a proposed rule in February 2012 that provided guidance on the revised AMP definition and calculation of FULs but has not issued a final rule.  Separately, under existing statutory authority granted by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, CMS has begun collecting retail survey price information from retail community pharmacies to generate publicly available pricing files. CMS expects that the pricing files will provide state Medicaid agencies with an array of covered outpatient drug prices and that state agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the surveys. CMS has begun posting drafts of this retail survey price information on at least a monthly basis in the form of draft National Average Drug Acquisition Cost ("NADAC") files, which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs, and National Average Retail Price ("NARP") files, which reflect retail community pharmacy prices to consumers. In July 2013, CMS suspended the publication of draft NARP data, pending funding decisions.  In November 2013, CMS moved to publishing final rather than draft NADAC data and has since made updated NADAC data publicly available on a weekly basis. The Company does not know how the new methodologies for calculating AMP and FULs or the retail survey price information will affect the Company's pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in Medicaid reimbursements to the Company. The Company cannot predict how the sharing of FUL data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace.Manufacturers also must participate in the 340B drug pricing program for U.S. federal funds to be available to pay for their drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Participating manufacturers must agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B ceiling price for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. Sales made by the Company pursuant to the 340B program are not material to the Company as a whole.U.S. law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report average sales price, or ASP, information to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program.  Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and implementing regulations as to what should or should not be considered in computing ASP.  An ASP for each National Drug Code for a product that is subject to the ASP reporting requirement must be submitted to CMS no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.  CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.  Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS binding guidance could affect the ASP calculations for the Company’s products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations.Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by the Company, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on the Company’s submission to CMS of the Company’s current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter.  If the Company becomes aware that its reporting for prior quarters was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, the Company is obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase the Company’s costs for complying with the  20laws and regulations governing the Medicaid rebate program. Any corrections to the Company’s rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in the Company’s rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. If the Company is found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price, or best price information to the government, the Company may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information.  If the Company is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of its average sales price, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied.  The Company’s failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, average sales price, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the submission is late beyond the due date.  Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the Company’s Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which the Company participates in the Medicaid program.  In the event that CMS terminates the Company’s rebate agreement, U.S. federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for the Company’s covered outpatient drugs.U.S. law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program. To participate, the Company is required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which the Company must make its "covered drugs" (i.e., innovators) available to the U.S. "Big Four" federal agencies - the VA, the Department of Defense, or DoD, the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard - at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the "non-federal average manufacturer price," or Non-FAMP, which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. If a company misstates Non-FAMPs or FCPs it must restate these figures. Pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to penalties of $100,000 for each item of false information.FSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed "tracking customer." Further, in addition to the "Big Four" agencies, all other U.S. federal agencies and some U.S. non-federal entities are authorized to access FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers other than the Big Four agencies "negotiated pricing" for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP; instead, such pricing is negotiated based on a mandatory disclosure of the contractor’s commercial "most favored customer" pricing. The Company offers one single FCP-based FSS contract price to all FSS purchasers. In addition, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA (now the Defense Health Agency (DHA)), to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the Company has entered into a Section 703 Agreement under which the Company has agreed to pay rebates on covered drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. Companies are required to list their innovator products on Section 703 Agreements in order for those products to be eligible for DoD formulary inclusion. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and the Company’s Section 703 Agreement and is based on the difference between the Annual Non-FAMP and the FCP (as described above, these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA).If the Company overcharges the government in connection with its FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, the Company is required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against the Company under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 21Other Regulatory Numerous U.S. federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe product and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. The Company is not a HIPAA covered entity and does not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply. However, the Company could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. The Company is unable to predict whether actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to the Company. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect the business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. The U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track and report such payments.  CMS issued a final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions and clarified the scope of the reporting obligations, as well as that applicable manufacturers must begin tracking on August 1, 2013 and report payment data to CMS by July 7, 2014 and annually thereafter. The Company has met the reporting requirements.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.  Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to the Company, may result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of the Company’s operations.  Consumer Product Safety CommissionUnder the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act ("PPPA"), the CPSC has authority to require that certain dietary supplements and certain pharmaceuticals have child-resistant packaging to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings. The CPSC has published regulations requiring iron-containing dietary supplements and various pharmaceuticals to have child resistant packaging, and has established rules for testing the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging and for ensuring senior adult effectiveness.The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ("CPSIA") amended the Consumer Product Safety Act ("CPSA") to require that the manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation certify that based on a reasonable testing program the product complies with CPSC requirements. This certification applies to pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements that require child-resistant packaging under the PPPA. The CPSC lifted the stay of enforcement of the certification requirement and the regulation has been in effect since February 9, 2010. 22Federal Trade CommissionThe FTC exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising and other promotional practices of marketers of dietary supplements and OTC pharmaceuticals and often works with the FDA regarding these practices. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC is also responsible for reviewing mergers between and acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigating certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry. The FTC could challenge these business practices in administrative or judicial proceedings. For example, in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, agreements between NDA and ANDA holders relating to settlements of patent litigation involving Paragraph IV certifications under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as well as agreements between generic applicants that have submitted ANDAs containing Paragraph IV certifications where the agreement concerns either company’s 180-day exclusivity, must be submitted to the FTC (and the United States Department of Justice) for review.U.S. State RegulationMost U.S. states regulate and require approval of a license to manufacture and distribute foods, drugs and pet care products under laws that generally parallel federal statutes. License requirements and fees vary by state. The Company is also subject to other state consumer health and safety regulations that could have a potential impact on the Company’s business if the Company is ever found to be non-compliant.  United States Pharmacopeial ConventionThe USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.NSF International NSF is an independent, not-for-profit, non-governmental organization providing risk management services for public health and safety. Its services include standards development, product certification, safety audits, management systems registration and education programs. NSF is accredited by the American National Standards Institute ("ANSI"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Standards Council of Canada. These accreditations attest to the competency of services provided by NSF and compliance with established national and international standards for third-party certification.The NSF Dietary Supplement Certification Program enables manufacturers to become independently registered by NSF as conforming to voluntary standards that provide a system of processes, procedures and documentation to assure the product produced has the strength, composition, quality and purity represented on the product label. The Company also has over 50 store brand products certified under NSF/ANSI Standard 173 for dietary supplement products.International Organization for Standardization ISO is an internationally recognized standard setting body. The Company's infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually. This ISO Standard specifies requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement.  Non-U.S. Regulation The Company, through its affiliates located in the U.K., manufactures, packages and distributes OTC and prescription pharmaceuticals and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services for major pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in the U.K. and for export to markets outside the U.K. The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, testing, labeling, advertising and sale of these products are subject to regulation by one or more U.K. agencies, including the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Department of  23Health, the Department of the Environment, Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Health and Safety Executive and the Department of Transport.The Company manufactures, packages and distributes Rx pharmaceutical, OTC pharmaceutical and nutritional products in Mexico. The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, advertising and sale of these products are subject to regulation by one or more Mexican agencies, including the Health Ministry, the Commercial and Industrial Secretariat, the Federal Work’s Secretariat, the Environmental Natural Resources and Fishing Secretariat, the Federal Environmental Protection Ministry, and the Treasury and Public Credit Secretariat and its Customs Government department.The Company manufacturers, packages and distributes hospital supplies and Rx pharmaceutical, OTC pharmaceutical and nutritional products in Australia. The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, advertising and sales of these products are subject to regulation by one or more Australian agencies, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA").The Company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with standards set by organizations such as the European Directorate of Quality Medicine ("EDQM"). The Company believes that its policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations.The Company exports OTC pharmaceutical and nutritional products, including infant formula, to foreign countries. Exporting requirements are regulated by the FDA and, where appropriate, DEA laws, as well as each individual country’s requirements for importation of such products. Each country requires approval of these products through a registration process by that country’s regulatory agencies. Registration requirements include the process, formula, packaging, testing, labeling, advertising and marketing of the products. Each country regulates what is required and may be represented to the public on labeling and promotional material. Approval for the sale of the Company’s products by foreign regulatory agencies may be subject to delays.The Company manufactures, packages and distributes infant formula products in the U.S., which are exported to customers in China. These products are subject to regulation by multiple Chinese regulatory agencies. The regulations applicable to infant formula and imported infant formulas are evolving, and further regulatory revisions are expected to be implemented in the future.  In April 2014, the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People’s Republic of China (CNCA) conducted an assessment on registration of infant formula dairy producers in the U.S.  As a result of this assessment the Company’s Vermont infant formula manufacturing site has been approved by CNCA to export infant formula to China.In Europe and Israel, the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products are regulated in a manner similar in many respects to NDA and ANDAs in the U.S. Legal requirements generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing and importation of any pharmaceutical product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain medical data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or manufactured and marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions. Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, including in the European Union, where these provisions were recently extended, although the application is not uniform. Similar provisions may be adopted by additional countries, including Israel, where legislation has been proposed. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.The Company develops and manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients in Israel and India for export to the U.S. and other global markets. The facilities and products are subject to regulation by the applicable regulatory bodies in the place of manufacture as well as the regulatory agency in which the product is exported. The Company's Israeli facility has been approved by the FDA, Israel Ministry of Health ("IMOH"), Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ("BfArM") of Germany, Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks ("COFEPRIS") of Mexico, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency ("PMDA") of Japan, and the Korean Food and Drug Administration ("KFDA") and has received GMP certification from each agency. The Company's India facility has been inspected by the FDA and has received GMP certification.  24Employees As of June 28, 2014, the Company had approximately 10,220 full-time and temporary employees worldwide, located as follows:Country Total Number ofEmployees Number of Employees Covered byCollective Bargaining AgreementsU.S. 6,500 290Israel 1,300 550Mexico 1,200 700U.K. 800 —Rest of the world 420 —Item 1A.Risk Factors. Risks Related to the Company's BusinessRisks Related to the Company's Products and IndustryThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry. An inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and operating results.  Several U.S. and non-U.S. agencies regulate the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising and sale of the Company's products. Various state and local agencies also regulate these activities. In addition, the Company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with the guidelines established by voluntary standards organizations. Should the Company or one of its third-party service providers used in the development or commercialization of products fail to adequately conform to these regulations and guidelines, there may be a material adverse impact on the operating results of the Company. Packaging, labeling or marketing changes mandated by the FDA or state and local agencies can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the Company. The U.S. government has enacted the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase the Company's operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. Required changes could also be related to safety or efficacy issues. Similarly, the failure by the Company or one of its suppliers to comply with manufacturing, quality and testing guidelines and regulations could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's operating results. There is also the risk that the FDA could require the Company to audit or repeat prior bioequivalence or clinical studies or the FDA could change or withdraw the approval governing such products, which could have a material adverse impact on the results of the Company's operations. The Company believes that it generally has a good relationship with the FDA, which it intends to maintain. If these relationships should deteriorate, however, the Company's ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded.  All U.S. facilities where Rx, infant formula, dietary supplements and OTC drugs are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with FDA cGMPs. All of the Company's ANDA, NDA and OTC drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that the Company's facilities remain in compliance with all applicable regulations.    If it finds violations of cGMP, the FDA could make its concerns public and could impose sanctions including, among others, fines, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA's review of product applications, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. If imposed, enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Although the Company has internal compliance programs in place that it believes are adequate, the FDA may conclude that these programs do not meet regulatory standards. If compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  25 The FDA's policy regarding the award of a 180-day market exclusivity period to generic manufacturers who successfully challenge patents relating to specific products continues to be the subject of extensive litigation in the U.S. The FDA's current interpretation of Hatch-Waxman is to award 180 days of exclusivity to the first generic manufacturer who files a successful Paragraph IV certification under Hatch-Waxman challenging the patent(s) of the branded product, regardless of whether the manufacturer was sued for patent infringement. Although the FDA's interpretation may benefit some of the products in the Company's pipeline, it may adversely affect others. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides that the 180-day market exclusivity period provided under Hatch-Waxman is triggered by the commercial marketing of the product. However, the Medicare Prescription Drug Act also contains forfeiture provisions which, if met, will deprive the first Paragraph IV filer of exclusivity. Additionally, the manufacturer of the branded product may launch a generic version of its own drug, known as an authorized generic. Under certain circumstances, the Company may not be able to fully exploit its 180-day exclusivity period resulting from it being the first filer.  Under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, the FDA has the power to restrict medications that raise serious safety concerns. This law requires, and provides funding for, the FDA to monitor drugs after they go on the market. In addition, this law requires companies to make public the results of many of their studies. Under this law, the FDA has the authority to require new studies, limit distribution or order label changes. Because of this law, the Company's ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded, which could have a negative material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  The Company's prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the FDA. The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the FDA's September 2011 compliance policy guide, titled "Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs." Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. The FDA recognizes that certain unapproved products, based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns, among other things, have been marketed for many years and, at this time, might not be subject to immediate enforcement action. The Company believes that so long as it complies with applicable manufacturing and labeling standards, it will be in compliance with the FDA's current enforcement policy. There can be no assurance that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. If the FDA were to take a contrary position, the Company may be required to seek FDA approval for these products or withdraw such products from the market. For fiscal 2014, the Company's annual sales for such unapproved products were approximately $36 million.  The Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee met in December 2007 to discuss the efficacy of phenylephrine, an active ingredient used in various cough and cold products as a nasal decongestant. The advisory committee vote recommended that available data is "supportive" of the efficacy of phenylephrine at 10 milligrams. In addition, the advisory committee recommended additional evidence to support the efficacy of a 10 milligram dose of phenylephrine. The recommendations by the advisory committee are not binding on the FDA. It is not known at this time what, if any, further action the FDA or industry will take in response to recommendations of the advisory committee.  In fiscal 2014, products containing phenylephrine generated revenues of approximately $77.7 million.  In October 2007, the FDA convened a joint meeting of the Pediatric and Nonprescription Drugs Advisory committees to discuss the safety and efficacy of OTC cough and cold products for use in children. The advisory committees recommended that these products no longer be used in children under the age of six. On October 8, 2008, the FDA issued a statement supporting the voluntary action of the Consumer Healthcare Product Association ("CHPA"), of which the Company is a member, to modify product labels for consumers of OTC cough and cold medicines to state "do not use" in children under four years of age. The Company completed the CHPA recommended revisions to all OTC cough and cold products in April 2010. The FDA has not issued any further guidance about the labeling of OTC cough and cold medicines in children two years of age and older. Sales of the Company's pediatric cough and cold products could be adversely affected should the FDA adopt the more restrictive recommendations of the advisory committee. The Company's activities with respect to its infant formula products also may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific  26content of infant formula products. In addition, regulatory changes or decisions that restrict the manufacture, labeling and availability of the Company's infant formula products could affect the Company's results of operations. For example, certain governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations and consumer advocates have lobbied against the marketing and sale of some infant formula products. These efforts could result in increased regulatory restrictions or enforcement. The U.S. government will likely continue to enhance its regulations on the industry aimed to ensure the safety and quality of dairy products, including, but not limited to, compulsory batch-by-batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues. Such inspections and testing may increase the Company's operating costs related to its infant formula products.  Additionally, the FDA is beginning to scrutinize claims on infant formula labels. Labeling changes required for regulatory compliance could render packaging inventories obsolete.The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain, and a limited extension of the generic drug paragraph IV 30-month stay provision. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic blocking citizen petitions. The Company implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of FDASIA. The Company monitors facility self-identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.On August 1, 2013, the FDA released a Drug Safety Communication notifying the public of an association between acetaminophen and the risk of rare, but serious, skin reactions (reddening of the skin, rash, blisters, detachment of the skin's upper surface).  This resulted from a review of the FDA adverse event database (1969-2012) and reports in the medical literature.  Other prescription and OTC drugs used to treat fever and pain/body aches (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen and naproxen) also carry the risk of causing serious skin reactions, which is already described in the warnings section of their drug labels. As a result of these findings, the FDA has required the addition of a warning addressing serious skin reactions to prescription drug products containing acetaminophen.  The FDA has also requested that manufacturers of acetaminophen OTC products marketed under a new drug application or under the OTC monograph add a similar warning.  The warning has not materialized or resulted in a change in product sales.On June 10, 2014, the FDA published a final rule ("FR") entitled "Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Control Procedures, Quality Factors, Notification Requirements, and Records and Reports, for Infant Formula." The FR includes, among other things, new or modified requirements related to infant formula manufacturing, quality controls, record-keeping, and clinical trials. While it is uncertain how the FDA will interpret and enforce the FR, the Company is taking steps to comply with the provisions of the FR. Compliance with the FR may require significant expenditures. To the extent the FDA believes that the Company has not complied with the FR, it could lead to potential supply chain disruptions and delays in commercialization of new infant formula products, which could impede the Company’s sales and revenue and adversely affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.The FDA conducts non-prescription drug advisory committee meetings to evaluate the safety of introducing new prescription categories to the OTC market.  The expansion of category switches is critical to the future growth of the Company.  FDA reluctance to approve OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth.The Company manufactures products that are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions; however, certain products contain ingredients that can be used for improper purposes. Additional legislation or regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's sales of such products and resulting income.  The Company's products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions. However, certain products contain ingredients that can be, and in some cases are, used for improper purposes.  Pseudoephedrine and dextromethorphan are two of these ingredients, but others may exist. Increasingly, various efforts are employed by U.S. federal and state governments in an effort to curb this misuse, including the consideration of additional legislation or regulation that may result in further restrictive requirements for the manufacture or sale of products containing these ingredients. The Company cannot predict if or when any additional legislation or regulation will be passed and any adverse impact it may have on the Company's results of operations.  27     Pseudoephedrine - The Company produces a number of products that contain the active ingredient pseudoephedrine ("PSE"), which is indicated as a nasal decongestant. PSE has been under scrutiny as an ingredient illegally used to produce methamphetamine. To address this concern, legislation has been enacted at the U.S. federal level restricting the sales of PSE products (i.e., Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act) and authorizing the DEA to place quotas on the amounts of PSE raw material that can be procured (i.e., the Controlled Substances Act). At the state level, a number of states have introduced or passed legislation placing additional restrictions on the sale of PSE products. In addition, the states of Oregon and Mississippi have moved PSE products to Rx status; many localities have passed similar legislation and a few other states have considered moving PSE products to Rx status. Additionally, certain retailers have voluntarily restricted sales of single active ingredient PSE-containing products in at least one state.  Sales of PSE products could be adversely affected by action at the U.S. state or federal level to place additional restrictions on the sale of PSE products. Dextromethorphan - The Company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient dextromethorphan, which is indicated for cough suppression. Dextromethorphan has come under scrutiny because of its potential to be abused. Legislation has been unsuccessfully introduced at the U.S. federal level over the past few sessions of Congress that, if enacted, generally would have prohibited the bulk sale of dextromethorphan and would have imposed an age limit of 18 years old in order to purchase finished products containing dextromethorphan. Similarly, six U.S. states and a number of localities have passed legislation to prohibit the sale of dextromethorphan containing products to minors without a prescription. It is possible that other government entities could introduce and pass legislation imposing additional or different restrictions on the sale of dextromethorphan in finished dosage form, such as requiring a minimum age to purchase product.  The Company cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation will be passed or, if it is passed, its impact on future revenues attributable to these products.      The FDA held a meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee on September 14, 2010 to discuss the potential abuse of the drug dextromethorphan and the public health benefits and risks of dextromethorphan use as a cough suppressant in prescription and nonprescription drug products. In a 15-9 vote, an FDA advisory panel voted not to restrict dextromethorphan cough medications to prescription-only. It is possible the FDA could still recommend in the future that dextromethorphan containing products be considered a scheduled substance, which would remove their status as an OTC product. The Company cannot predict the likelihood of such activity by the FDA or any adverse impact such activity may have on the Company's results of operations. In fiscal 2014, products containing dextromethorphan generated revenues of approximately $131.3 million. Acetaminophen - The Company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient acetaminophen, which is indicated as an analgesic. In June 2009, the FDA held a public advisory committee meeting to discuss how to address the potential for liver injury related to the risk of overdose of acetaminophen in both OTC and Rx products. The FDA expressly stated that the risk of developing liver injury to the individual patient who uses the drug according to directions is extremely low and that it is not seeking to remove acetaminophen from the market. However, due to the extensive use of acetaminophen-containing products, the FDA sought guidance from several advisory committees regarding measures to reduce the potential for liver injury associated with acetaminophen use. Measures discussed include, but were not limited to, reducing the maximum single-dose and daily-dose, reducing packaging sizes, and increasing consumer educational efforts regarding such products. At a May 2011 meeting of the FDA's Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee to review efforts to reduce medication errors around the use of single-ingredient pediatric acetaminophen, the FDA joint committees unanimously voted: (1) in support of the addition to the label of weight-based dosing for children ages two to twelve; (2) that the pharmacokinetic ("PK"), safety and efficacy data would be required to support the addition of new label directions for children six months to two years of age; and (3) that the new labeling for children six months to two years of age include the indication for fever reduction. The committees did not support an indication in labeling for children six months to two years of age for relief of pain; this indication is currently included for children over two years of age. The FDA is reviewing the input it received from the advisory committees and additional comments submitted through the docket. In fiscal 2014, products containing acetaminophen generated revenues of approximately $260.1 million for the Company. The Company cannot predict whether the FDA will adopt any recommendations of the advisory committees regarding the sale and use of acetaminophen or whether any such recommendations, if adopted by the FDA, would impact future revenues attributable to these products.  28U.S. federal and state healthcare reform and related changes to reimbursement methods, as well as measures in Israel and many European countries, may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  Increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in North America, Israel and many European countries. Both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs. In many countries where the Company currently operates, pharmaceutical prices are subject to regulation. In the U.S., numerous proposals that would effect changes in the U.S. healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that could include, but not be limited to, intellectual property, regulatory, antitrust, drug pricing and product liability issues. Similar activities are taking place throughout Europe. As a result of governmental budgetary constraints, the Israel Ministry of Health and the major Israeli health funds have sought to further reduce healthcare costs by, among other things, applying continuous pressure to reduce pharmaceutical prices and inventory levels. The Company cannot predict the nature of the measures that may be adopted, how they will be interpreted by the courts or the administrative agencies charged with enforcing them or their impact on the marketing, pricing and demand for its products.  The Company has a Medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the U.S. federal government. U.S. federal and/or state governments have enacted and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public, including health reform legislation enacted in 2010. Management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the Company's profitability. Various U.S. states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on Medicaid utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer's federal Medicaid agreement. States also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non-Medicaid populations, known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs. These rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the U.S. federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated. Although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs, for the Company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to its Medicaid drug rebate obligations.  As discussed under "Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Other Drug Pricing Programs," the Company is required to report AMP data to CMS on a monthly as well as a quarterly basis. In addition to using AMP to calculate Medicaid rebates, CMS is preparing to use AMP to calculate a type of U.S. federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multiple source drugs to pharmacies under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limit ("FUL"). Prior to using AMP, CMS typically used pricing data from third-party compendia, such as the AWP or WAC, in the calculation of FULs. Health reform legislation enacted in 2010 amended the statutory definition of AMP and also amended the definition of "multiple source drug" in a manner that materially affects the calculation of FULs. CMS has begun posting draft AMP-based FUL reimbursement files on the CMS website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation. Currently, the FUL reimbursement files are for review and comment only; however, CMS has announced that it plans to publish final FULs after a period of releasing them in draft format. CMS issued a proposed rule in February 2012 that provided guidance on the revised AMP definition and calculation of FULs but has not issued a final rule. Separately, under existing statutory authority granted by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, CMS has begun collecting retail survey price information from retail community pharmacies to generate publicly available pricing files. CMS expects that the pricing files will provide state Medicaid agencies with an array of covered outpatient drug prices and that state agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the surveys. CMS has begun posting drafts of this retail survey price information on at least a monthly basis in the form of draft NADAC files, which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs, and NARP files, which reflect retail community pharmacy prices to consumers. In July 2013, CMS suspended the publication of draft NARP data, pending funding decisions. In November 2013, CMS moved to publishing final rather than draft NADAC data and has since made updated NADAC data publicly available on a weekly basis. The Company does not know how the new methodologies for calculating AMP and FULs or the retail survey price information will affect the Company's pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in Medicaid reimbursements to the Company. The Company cannot predict how the sharing of FUL and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace.  The Company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues outside the U.S., too. In the European Union and some other international markets, the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored  29healthcare system. Many countries are seeking to reduce their public expenditures on healthcare. These efforts may result in patient access restrictions, increased pressure on drug pricing, including denial of price increases, prospective and retrospective price decreases and increased mandatory discounts or rebates.The Company's reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that the Company has failed to comply with those obligations could subject it to penalties and sanctions, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs.  The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to Medicaid reimbursement and rebates and other governmental programs are complex and are often subject to interpretation by the Company, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Company's calculations and methodologies are subject to review by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in challenges to the Company’s submissions. If there is ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments, and even in the absence of any such ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position that the Company has taken and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions.  In addition, because these calculations involve, and will continue to involve, subjective decisions and complex methodologies, they are subject to the risk of errors.Any governmental agencies that have commenced or that may commence an investigation of the Company could impose civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs (including Medicaid and Medicare). Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments, and even in the absence of any such ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position that we have taken and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions on us, as disclosed above.  Any such penalties, sanctions, or exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of its common stock to decline.            In June 2013, the Company received notices from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Texas, of civil investigative demands to two of the Company’s affiliates, Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Company and Paddock Laboratories, LLC, for information under the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act relating to the submission of prices to Texas Medicaid in claims for reimbursement for drugs.  The Company has cooperated with requests for information and is in the process of evaluating this and other information.  While the Company does not know the full extent of its potential liability at this time and intends to vigorously defend against any claims, the Company could be subject to material penalties and damages. The Company established a contingency loss accrual of $15.0 million to cover potential settlement or other outcomes. The Company cannot predict whether settlement on terms acceptable to it will occur, or that a settlement or potential liability for these claims will not be greater than the amount recorded. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the Company's products and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business.   The Company is dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety and quality of its products. Negative consumer perception may arise from media reports, product liability claims, regulatory investigations or recalls, regardless of whether such media reports, claims, investigations or recalls involve the Company or its products. The mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients or concerns about the Company's products or the raw materials used in the Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company, regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported. For example, any major outbreak of illness or disease in cows could lead to a serious loss of consumer confidence in, and demand for, dairy products, including the Company's infant formula products. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may negatively impact consumer perceptions and may discourage consumers from buying one or more of the Company's products, such that the Company's sales may decline and the Company may suffer losses in its business.  The Company may incur liabilities or experience negative effects on its reputation as a result of any real or perceived quality issues with the Company's products. The Company's products involve risks such as product contamination, spoilage, mislabeling and tampering that could require the Company to recall one or more of its products. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the Company that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the Company's products, product  30seizures, loss of certain licenses, delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products or other governmental penalties. Adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding the quality of the Company's products, particular ingredients, or the industries in which the Company competes could result in a substantial decrease in demand for the Company's products.  The Company cannot guarantee that counterfeiting, imitation, or other tampering with its products will not occur or that the Company will be able to detect and resolve it if it happens. Any occurrence of counterfeiting or contamination could negatively impact sales of the Company's products, particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers of those products.  Additionally, powdered infant formula products are not sterile. All of the Company's infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration. Depending on the product, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw materials, the processing and packaging of food products, and the use and handling by consumers, hospital personnel and health care professionals. In the event that certain of the Company's infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not such products are under the Company's control, the Company's reputation and its infant formula product category could be materially adversely affected.  The Company's infant formula product category is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutrition-related concerns. The Company's results of operations depend, in part, on consumer preferences and choices, including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies. To the extent that private, public and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula, there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products, and the Company's infant formula products business could be adversely affected. The Company's infant formula product category may also be affected by medical research relating to the healthfulness of cow's milk in the human diet. For example, adverse research may raise concerns about the fat, cholesterol, calorie, sodium and lactose content or contamination of dairy products, including infant formula. Any significant shift in consumer preference away from the use of infant formula may materially and adversely affect the results of operations of the Company's infant formula product category. Additionally, the Company's infant formula product category could be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the U.S. federal government through the Women, Infants and Children program, as the Company does not participate in this program.  The Company believes that growth in the nutritional products business is based largely on national media attention regarding scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from regular consumption of certain vitamin and other nutritional products. There can be no assurance of future favorable scientific results and media attention, or the absence of unfavorable or inconsistent findings. In the event of future unfavorable scientific results or media attention, the Company's sales of nutritional products could be materially adversely impacted. The Company manufactures spot-on pesticides for the monthly control of fleas, ticks, or other external parasites in dogs and cats. These products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions; however, pesticide ingredients may cause harm to animals and humans if used improperly. Additional regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's sales of such products and resulting income. In spring 2009, the EPA noticed an increase in pet incidents being reported involving spot-on pesticide products for pets. The EPA received a large amount of information on individual reported adverse pet incidents from the companies that hold registrations for these products (called the registrants). The EPA also reviewed other information that was submitted. The EPA formed an expert veterinarian team to thoroughly analyze the data. The EPA also partnered with the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine ("CVM") and Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency ("PMRA") on the review of this analysis. The team studied incidents involving cats and dogs, looked at both active and inert ingredients, studied product labeling, and discussed data needs for the future to improve analyses and regulation. The EPA found that the products could be used safely but that some additional restrictions are needed. The EPA's team of veterinarians learned that most incidents were minor, but unfortunately there were some pet deaths and "major incidents" reported. The EPA learned that the most commonly affected organ systems were dermal, gastrointestinal, and nervous. Recommendations to reduce harmful effects include addressing concerns about dosing, improving labeling to avoid confusion between dog and cat products, making labels more understandable with larger fonts and pictograms, addressing uncertainties about the inert ingredients in these products, imposing conditions of registration when granting amendments to existing products or  31granting new registrations, requiring more standardized reporting on adverse effects and sales, changing data requirements for pre-market clinical trials and implementing a formal post-market surveillance program. Future pet spot-on pesticide registrations and amendments to new registrations will be restricted by appropriate conditions and time-limitations to allow the EPA to continue to ensure the safety of these products after they are available to the public.The EPA mitigation efforts for educating consumers and reducing misuse are ongoing. The Company cannot predict whether further label restrictions may be required, or whether additional regulations may be passed, or to the extent of the adverse impact additional restrictions or regulations may have on the Company's results of operations. The manufacturing of sterile, injectable products is highly exacting and complex, and if the Company's suppliers encounter production problems, it could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company distributes sterile, injectable products that are manufactured by third parties. The manufacture of sterile, injectable products is highly complex and exacting in part due to strict regulatory and safety requirements and standards that govern both the manufacture and packaging of these types of projects. Failure of the third-party manufacturers to maintain strict controls or adherence to procedures may result in product recalls and liability claims, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and reputation.Biogen Idec is directly responsible for the sales and distribution of Tysabri® and as a result any change in strategy by Biogen Idec or negative developments relating to Tysabri® could have a material impact on the Company’s revenues, operating income and cash flows.The Company acquired a significant revenue stream and a $5.8 billion intangible asset related to sales of the Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri® with the acquisition of Elan.  The Company collects quarterly royalty payments from Biogen Idec, which is solely responsible for the sales and distribution of the drug. The Tysabri® royalty stream is expected to contribute significant revenues, operating income and cash flows to the Company’s results of operations.  Any negative developments relating to Tysabri®, such as safety, efficacy or reimbursement issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, including biosimilars, or adverse regulatory or legislative developments may reduce the payments the Company receives and adversely affect the results of operations.  New competing products for use in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis have (or will soon) entered the market, including Tecfidera for which Biogen Idec launched in the U.S. and Europe in fiscal 2014.  If any of these competing products have a similar or more attractive profile in terms of efficacy, convenience or safety, future sales of Tysabri® could be limited, which would reduce royalties received.  Tysabri®'s sales growth cannot be assured given the significant restrictions on its use and the significant safety warnings in the label, including the risk of developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ("PML"), a serious brain infection.  The risk of developing PML increases with prior immunosuppressant ("IS") use, which may cause patients who have previously received IS or their physicians to refrain from using or prescribing Tysabri®.  The risk of developing PML also increases with longer treatment duration, with limited experience beyond four years.  This may cause prescribing physicians or patients to suspend treatment with Tysabri®.  In addition, the risk of developing PML is heightened when a patient has anti-JC virus ("JCV") antibodies.  In January 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a product label change for Tysabri® that identifies anti-JCV antibody status as a risk factor for PML.  This risk had already been incorporated into the European label for Tysabri® in June 2011.  Physicians have discontinued treatment and are likely to continue to discontinue treatment with Tysabri® in patients who test positive for JCV antibodies.  Increased incidence of PML could limit sales growth, prompt regulatory review, require significant changes to the label or result in market withdrawal.  Additional regulatory restrictions on the use of Tysabri® or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, whether as a result of additional cases of PML or otherwise, may significantly reduce expected revenues and require significant expense and management time to address the associated legal and regulatory issues. In addition, ongoing or future clinical trials involving  Tysabri®, efforts at stratifying patients into groups with lower or higher risk for developing PML and the commercial availability of the JCV antibody assay may have an adverse impact on prescribing behavior and reduce sales of Tysabri®.  Further, the utility of the JCV antibody assay may be diminished as a result of the assay’s false negative rate and because a patient who tests negative for JCV antibodies may be infected by the JCV after testing.  Any or all of the above factors could lead to volatility in the number of patients who begin or continue to use Tysabri® or discontinue the use of Tysabri® in any period. 32The Company's success is dependent, in large part, on continued store brand growth for its OTC and Nutritionals products, which is influenced by factors outside management's control. There can be no assurance that store brand market share will continue to grow; failure to achieve continued growth may adversely impact the Company's sales and resulting financial condition.  The future growth of U.S. store brand products market share will be influenced, in part, by general economic conditions, which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products, consumer perception and acceptance of the quality of the products available, the development of new products and/or product delivery forms, the market exclusivity periods awarded on Rx to OTC switch products and the ongoing or growing strength of the retailers' brands in the market. The OTC business does not advertise like the national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share. Growth opportunities for the products in which the Company currently has a significant store brand market share (cough/cold/flu/allergy, analgesic, smoking cessation and gastrointestinal products) will be driven by the ability to offer new products to existing U.S. customers. Branded pharmaceutical companies may use U.S. state and federal regulatory and legislative means to limit the availability of brand equivalent products. Should store brand growth be limited by any of these factors, there could be a significant adverse impact on the operating results of the Company. If the Company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, it may lose market share, and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected.  The Company understands that maintaining high levels of customer service requires the Company to be able to deliver high quality products to its customers on a timely basis. From time to time, the Company may experience interruptions and challenges to its customer service levels due to a variety of factors that may arise.  If the Company is unable to deliver to expected customer service levels, customers may choose to assess penalties, obtain alternate sources for products, withhold new product introductions and/or end the relationship with the Company.  If the Company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, due to these factors or otherwise, the Company may lose market share, and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected. Because the Company depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of its sales, the Company's sales and income would be adversely affected by a disruption of its relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' business.  The Company believes its primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current marketplace of the retail drug industry. Sales to the Company's largest customer, Walmart, comprised approximately 19% of fiscal 2014 net sales. Should Walmart's current relationship with the Company change adversely, the resulting loss of business could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. In addition, while no other customer individually comprises more than 10% of total net sales, the Company does have other significant customers. If the Company's relationship with one or more of these other customers, including the terms for doing business with the customers, changes significantly, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. If the Company cannot continue to rapidly develop, manufacture and market innovative products that meet customer requirements for performance, safety and cost effectiveness, it may lose market share and its revenues may be negatively impacted. The Company's future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, upon its ability to successfully commercialize additional OTC and generic prescription drugs and/or innovative pharmaceuticals, infant formulas and API. All pharmaceutical products must meet regulatory standards and/or receive regulatory approvals. The Company must prove that the ANDA or NDA drug products are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts, which typically requires bioequivalency studies or even more extensive clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy of topical products. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. Products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as expected, may not pass required bioequivalence studies or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges, and necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all, and the Company may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products. Delays in any part of the process or the Company's inability to obtain regulatory approval of its products (including products developed by others to which the Company has exclusive marketing rights) could adversely affect operating results by restricting or delaying its introduction of new products. Even upon the  33successful development of a product, the Company's customer's failure to launch a product could adversely affect operating results. The FDA could impose higher standards and additional requirements, such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required, in order to gain FDA clearance to launch new formulations into the market. Continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to the Company's business. Product margins may decline over time due to the products' aging life cycles, changes in consumer choice or developments in new drug delivery technology. Therefore, new product introductions are necessary for maintenance of the Company's current financial condition, and if the Company fails to introduce and market new products, the effect on its financial results could be materially adverse.  The Company contracts with clinical research organizations ("CROs") to conduct various studies that are used to support the Company's new product development program. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, certain of the CROs used by the Company began bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, including PRACS Institute, LLC, PRACS Institute Canada B.C. Ltd., Comprehensive Clinical Development, Inc., and their related entities. It is uncertain what, if any, impact these insolvency proceedings may have on the ability of those CROs to deliver their study results to the Company or on the Company's ability to rely on research performed by those CROs. To the extent those CROs cannot deliver their study results to the Company or the Company cannot rely, in whole or in part, on the research conducted by those CROs, it may delay the launch of new products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future operating results. These situations are unique and therefore it is uncertain what the position of the FDA will be towards the studies conducted by these now bankrupt CROs. The FDA may be limited in its ability to inspect the study facilities or gain access to source study documents which may result in the Company having to repeat biostudies. If these scenarios occur, it would result in approval delays.  The Company's investment in research and development is expected to increase above recent levels in dollar terms due to the Company's ongoing broadening of its OTC, ANDA or NDA, generic prescription and specialty API product portfolio, as well as several opportunities for new products that are switching or are anticipated to be switching from Rx to OTC status. The ability to attract scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and/or contracting with a third party in order to generate new products of this type is a critical element of the Company's long-term plans. Should the Company fail to attract qualified employees, successfully develop products in a timely manner, or enter into reasonable agreements with third parties, long-term sales growth and profit would be adversely impacted. Changes in supply relationships with the Company's customers, such as alternate sources for products, withholding new product introductions and/or development of customer store brand programs, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  Maintaining the supply relationships with the Company's customers is critical to its success. The success in recent years of private label marketing and branding programs has increased large retailers' attention to the importance of their store brand programs, and as a result, many are dedicating significant resources to auditing supplier compliance with their quality, ethical and service standards. Customers may limit the level of product sourcing with the Company in protection of the customer's own interests. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The competitive markets in which the Company operates could lead to reduced demand for its products in favor of its competitors' products, which could negatively impact its sales, gross margin, and prospects.  The markets for OTC pharmaceutical, animal health, nutritional, infant formula, generic pharmaceutical and API products are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price, quality and assortment of products, customer service, marketing support and availability of new products. Competition also comes from national brand companies and branded pharmaceutical companies. That competition could be intensified should those companies lower prices or manufacture their own store brand or generic equivalent products. Due to the high degree of price competition, the Company has not always been able to fully pass on cost increases to its customers. The inability to pass on future cost increases, the impact of store brand competitors and the impact of national brand companies lowering prices of their products, offering special promotional discounts or operating in the store brand market could have a material adverse impact on financial results. The Company also sells nationally branded animal health products. The animal health segment has seen a dramatic increase in the direct to consumer advertising of several branded competitors. The Company may see an increase in competition as more competitors increase national advertising expenditures. As additional companies come to market with product registrations similar to the Company, pricing strategies or marketing support may need to become more competitive. In addition, since the Company sells its nutritional products through retail drug, supermarket and mass merchandise chains, it may  34experience increased competition in its nutritional products business through alternative channels such as health food stores, direct mail and direct sales as more consumers obtain products through these channels. The Company has evaluated, and will continue to evaluate, the products and product categories in which it does business. Future product line extensions, or deletions, could have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  Selling prices of generic drugs typically decline, sometimes dramatically, as competition intensifies due to additional companies receiving approvals for a given product or brands launching authorized generics. To the extent that the Company succeeds in being the first to market a generic version of a significant product, the Company's sales and profit can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor's introduction of an equivalent product. The Company's ability to sustain its sales and profitability on any product over time is dependent on both the number of new competitors for such product, some of whom may be significantly larger than the Company, and the timing of their approvals.  Certain competitors are choosing to consolidate in the generic pharmaceutical and nutritional industries. These consolidations may create larger companies with which the Company must compete and provide further pressure on prices, development activities or customer retention. The impact of future consolidation in the industry could have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  The Company's API business is subject to increased competition from other manufacturers of API located in Europe and developing countries, such as India and China. Such competition may result in loss of API customers and/or decreased profitability in this business segment. Many companies are working to develop new therapies or alternative formulations of products for MS that, if successfully developed, would compete with Tysabri®.  A drug may be subject to competition from alternative therapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity and, thereafter, it may be subject to further competition from generic products or biosimilars. The Company's quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors, some of which are beyond the control of management, that may result in significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results.  The Company's quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length and timing of the cough/cold/flu season and flea and tick season, the timing of new product approvals and introductions by the Company and its competitors, price competition, changes in the regulatory environment, the magnitude and timing of research and development investments, changes in the levels of inventories maintained by the Company's customers and the timing of retailer promotional programs. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to significant and unanticipated quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in its operating results.  Changes in estimates regarding fair value of goodwill or intangible assets may result in an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.  The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss. The Company's testing in fiscal 2014 resulted in no impairment charges related to goodwill.  Other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology/formulation and product rights, distribution and license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, in-process research and development ("IPR&D") and trade names and trademarks. Certain trade names and trademarks, as well as IPR&D assets, are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding impairment of intangible assets.  35Lack of availability of, or significant increases in the cost of, raw materials used in manufacturing the Company's products could adversely impact its profit margins and operating results.  Affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the Company's business units due to the nature of the products the Company manufactures. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials, bulk tablets and finished goods purchased by the Company are limited, or are available from one or only a few suppliers. In these situations, increased prices, rationing and shortages can occur. In response to these problems the Company tries to identify alternative materials or suppliers for such raw materials, bulk tablets and finished goods. FDA requirements for products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source. Certain material shortages and approval of alternate sources could adversely affect financial results. The rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces, such as increased energy costs, and the Company's ability or inability to pass on these increases to its customers, could have a material impact on the Company's financial results.  The Company maintains several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect the Company's ability to ship the related product in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with the Company's higher volume or more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of revenues. As a result, the loss of a single-source supplier could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.  In addition, raw materials purchased from third parties, including those from foreign countries, may contain counterfeit ingredients or other adulterants. The Company maintains a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants and toxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the Company and lost revenue and may give rise to product liability litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the Company.  The Company's infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk, such as skim milk powder, whey protein powder and lactose. The Company's supply of milk-based ingredients may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality necessary to meet the needs of the Company's infant formula product category. Raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond the Company's control, including: (1) seasonal factors, such as dairy cows producing more milk in temperate weather than hot or cold weather, drought and extended unseasonably hot or cold weather potentially leading to lower than expected supplies; (2) environmental factors, such as the volume and quality of milk produced by dairy cows being linked closely to the quality of nourishment provided by the surrounding environment; (3) governmental agricultural and environmental policy, such as government grants, subsidies, land provisions, technical assistance, and other agricultural and environmental policies having a direct effect on the viability of individual dairy farmers and dairy farmer cooperatives and the number of dairy cows and quantities of milk they are able to produce and (4) global demand for milk and key ingredients derived from milk. The Company cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients derived from raw milk. Any disruption in the supply of these key ingredients derived from raw milk could adversely and materially impact the Company's infant formula product category.  The Company's products, and the raw materials used to make those products, generally have limited shelf lives. The Company's inventory levels are based, in part, on expectations regarding future sales. The Company may experience build-ups in inventory if sales slow. Any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products, thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs, which may materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Cargo thefts and/or diversions and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering on store shelves may be experienced from time to time, causing unexpected shortages.  36If the Company is unable to successfully obtain the necessary quota for controlled substances and List 1 chemicals, there is risk of delayed product launches or failure to meet commercial supply obligations. If the Company is unable to comply with regulatory requirements for controlled substances and List 1 chemicals, the DEA may take regulatory actions, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution, withdrawal of products from the market or other penalties.  Controlled substances and List 1 chemicals are subject to DEA regulation under the Controlled Substances Act. DEA quota requirements can limit the amount of controlled substances and List 1 chemicals a manufacturer may produce, the amount of API it may use to manufacture those products and the amount of controlled substance products and List 1 chemicals a packager may package. If the Company is unable to successfully obtain the quota amounts, there is the risk of delayed launches or failure to meet commercial supply obligations. In addition, failure to comply with the above laws and requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings. The costs, both financially and in regard to management attention, of combating legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries become involved in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters, including, but not limited to, competitive issues, contract issues, intellectual property matters, false advertising/unfair competition, taxation matters, workers' compensation, product liability, environmental remediation issues and U.S. state or federal regulatory issues. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation is unpredictable and can be costly. No assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in the future. Similarly, judicial decisions in proceedings to which the Company is not a party may result in the setting of legal precedent that could affect the future operation of the Company's business. In addition, the Company may face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of its operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of its employees. While the Company does not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding, the Company may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in its currently or formerly owned property, or from a third-party disposal facility that it may have used, without regard to whether the Company knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The actual or alleged presence of, or failure to remediate properly, these substances could have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company may also be subject to liability if its products violate or are alleged to violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where such products are distributed or in the event that its products cause or are alleged to cause injury, illness, or death. The successful assertion of product liability claims against the Company could result in potentially significant monetary damages and diversion of management resources, and require the Company to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, the Company may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and the Company's reputation may suffer. With regard to Tysabri®, the Company’s subsidiary Elan is a defendant in product liability lawsuits arising out of serious adverse events, including deaths, which occurred in patients taking Tysabri®. The Company expects additional product liability lawsuits related to Tysabri® usage to be filed. While the Company or Biogen Idec intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits, the Company cannot predict how these cases will be resolved.  The Company and Biogen Idec will each be responsible for 50% of losses and expenses arising out of any Tysabri® product liability claims. Adverse results in one or more of these cases could result in substantial monetary judgments. 37Court rulings limiting the application of U.S. Federal preemption may have an adverse effect on the Company's operations as a result of a potential increase in litigation exposure.On November 13, 2013, the FDA issued a proposed rule captioned, “Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs and Biologics.”  Pursuant to the proposed rule, the FDA is proposing  to change existing regulations to expressly provide that generic drug application holders may distribute revised labeling that differs from the corresponding brand drug upon submission of a  "changes being effected" ("CBE-0") supplement to FDA.  FDA states that the proposed revisions to its regulations would create parity between branded drug application holders and generic drug application holders with respect to submission of CBE-0 supplements for safety-related labeling changes based on newly acquired information. This proposal is also intended to ensure that generic drug companies actively participate with FDA in ensuring the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of drug safety labeling in accordance with current regulatory requirements.  The FDA received comments on the proposed rule until March 13, 2014.  The FDA has not yet issued a final rule on this issue.  If this proposed regulatory change is adopted, it may eliminate the preemption of certain failure-to-warn claims, with respect to generic drugs, which could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the Company.   Third-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit the Company's ability to bring new products to market and may subject the Company to potential legal liability. The failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner without incurring legal liability could cause the Company to lose market share and its operating results may suffer.  The Company's ability to bring new products to market is limited by certain patent, trademark and trade dress factors including, but not limited to, the existence of patents protecting brand products for all business segments and the regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products. The cost and time to develop these prescription and switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that the Company seeks to introduce. Moreover, the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. The Company may have to defend against charges that it violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. The Company's defense against charges that it infringed third-party patents or proprietary rights could require the Company to incur substantial expense and to divert significant effort of its technical and management personnel. If the Company is found to have infringed on the rights of others, it could lose its right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties.  Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the Company cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to it on terms it believes to be acceptable. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the Company from manufacturing and selling a number of its products.  At times, the Company may seek approval to market NDA or ANDA products before the expiration of patents for those products, based upon its belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by its products. As a result, the Company may face significant patent litigation. Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, the Company may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending, before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending. This is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an "at risk" launch. The risk involved in an "at risk" launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails, the remedies available to the patent holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the holder, which are often significantly higher than the profits the Company makes from selling the generic version of the product. By electing to proceed in this manner, the Company could face substantial damages if a final court decision is adverse to the Company. In the case where a patent holder is able to prove that the Company's infringement was "willful" or "exceptional", under applicable law, the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages or the Company may be required to pay attorneys’ fees.  In May 2014, the Company launched azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray prior to a court decision.  The litigation was settled in June 2014. 38The success of certain of the Company's products depends on the effectiveness of measures it takes to protect its intellectual property rights and patents.  The Company's success with certain of its products depends, in part, on its ability to protect and defend its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property, competitors may manufacture and market similar products. The Company has been issued patents covering certain of its products, and has filed, and expects to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries, including the U.S.  Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by the Company may not provide it with any significant competitive advantages for its products or may even be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors. In addition, such patent rights may not prevent the Company's competitors from developing, using or commercializing non-infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to its products.  The Company also relies on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation that it seeks to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. If these agreements are breached, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, the Company may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights. The Company is also increasing its research and development efforts in countries where risks of improper disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary technology are higher than in the U.S. and Israel. A significant disruption at any of the Company's main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.  The Company's U.S. manufacturing operations are concentrated in Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina, New York, Vermont, Ohio, and Nebraska.  The primary non-U.S. operations are in Israel. Approximately 80% of the Company's fiscal 2014 revenues are related to these world-wide manufacturing facilities. A significant disruption resulting from, but not limited to, fire, tornado, storm, flood, cyber attacks, material supply, insufficient quality, or pandemic at any of the Company's facilities could impair its ability to develop, produce and/or ship products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and operating results. The Company is dependent on the services of certain key executive and scientific employees. The failure to attract and retain such employees may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.  The Company's future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Key functions for the Company include executive managers, operational managers, research and development scientists, information technology specialists, financial and legal specialists, regulatory professionals, quality compliance specialists and sales/marketing personnel. Should the Company be unable to attract or retain key qualified employees, future operating results may be adversely impacted. Increasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security or reputation damage.  The Company and its employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of  communication both internally and externally. To the extent that the Company seeks to use these tools as a means to communicate about its products and/or business, there are uncertainties as to either the rules that apply to such communications, or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist. As a result, despite the Company's efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that the Company's use of social media for such purposes may cause it to be found in violation of them. In addition, because of the availability of social media tools globally, the Company's employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of them in ways that may not be aligned with the Company's social media strategy, and that may give rise to liability, or could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of the Company's employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others. In either case, such uses of social media could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative posts or comments about the Company,  39store brands or generic pharmaceuticals, or its products in social media could seriously damage its reputation and could adversely affect the price of its securities.  To protect itself against various potential liabilities, the Company maintains a variety of insurance programs. Significant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of such insurance could adversely impact the Company's financial condition.  The Company maintains insurance, including property, general and product liability, and directors' and officers' liability to protect itself against potential loss exposures. The Company cannot predict whether deductible or retention amounts will increase or whether coverage will be reduced in the future. To the extent that losses occur, there could be an adverse effect on the Company's financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained by the Company. From time to time, the Company may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that it purchases.  We are self-insured when insurance is not available, retain certain self-insured retentions and have risk management strategies where insurance is not available at reasonable premium levels.    The Company, like retailers and other distributors and manufacturers of products, is exposed to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury. There is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the Company at an economically reasonable cost (or at all for certain specific products) or that the Company's insurance will be adequate to cover liability that the Company incurs in connection with product liability claims. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to Legal Proceedings. Risks Related to AcquisitionsAlthough the Company only enters into business acquisitions and divestitures that it expects will result in benefits to the Company, the Company may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's stock price or operating results.  As part of the Company's strategy, it evaluates potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, some of which could be and have been material. Potential acquisition targets are evaluated on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital ("ROIC") in excess of 200 basis points over the Company’s weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") within three years.  Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: •uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent and other liabilities of, the respective parties; •the potential loss of key customers, management and employees of an acquired business; •the consummation of financing transactions, acquisitions or dispositions and the related effects on the Company's business; •the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies from an acquisition in the amounts and on the timeframe; •problems that could arise from the integration of the respective businesses, including the application of internal control processes to the acquired business; and•unanticipated changes in business, industry, market, or general economic conditions that differ from the assumptions underlying the Company's rationale for pursuing the transaction.Any one or more of these factors could cause the Company not to realize the benefits anticipated from a transaction. Moreover, any acquisition opportunities the Company pursues could materially affect its liquidity and capital resources and may require the Company to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. Future acquisitions could also result in the Company assuming more long-term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets than it has assumed in its previous acquisitions. Further, acquisition accounting rules require evaluation of certain assumptions, estimates or determination of financial statement classifications, which are completed during the measurement period as defined in current accounting standards. Accounting policies of the Company and acquisition accounting rules may materially vary from those of the acquired company. Any changes in assumptions, estimates or financial statement classifications may be material and have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities or future earnings of the new combined consolidated company.   40In addition, integration activities may place substantial demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation and business. The Company's failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on its operations. Integration risks and synergies associated with the Company's acquisitions are likely to include, but are not limited to, sales force, sales channel or product portfolio rationalization; manufacturing, distribution and supply chain integration and purchasing savings; quality and regulatory process standardization; and information technology and administration shared service implementations. The dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the Company's day-to-day business, and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transaction process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts. In addition, a lack of performance of acquisitions could cause financial difficulties. The Company also evaluates the performance of all operating business units against an ROIC threshold. Underperforming assets typically have a specific period to improve performance before other strategic alternatives are considered. The Company's inability to successfully divest or sell assets in a timely manner could have a negative effect on its operations. In addition, the process of divestitures could cause strains on the ongoing operations of the Company. The Company's actual financial positions and results of operations may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The pro forma financial information contained in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of what the Company's financial position or results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated.  The pro forma financial information has been derived from the historical financial information of Perrigo Company, Elan and the acquired Fera and Aspen assets, and certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding the combined company after giving effect to the transactions.  The acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been measured at fair value based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that the Company's management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently available.  The process for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates.  These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.  The pro forma financial data is based on a preliminary purchase price allocation, and the actual allocation of the purchase price will be performed only after all purchase price adjustments have been completed.  Accordingly, the actual financial condition and results of operations of the combined company may not be consistent with, or evident from, this pro forma financial information.    In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  Acquisition accounting rules require evaluation of certain assumptions, estimates or determination of financial statement classifications that are completed during the measurement period as defined in current accounting standards.  The Company's accounting policies and acquisition accounting rules may materially vary from those of its acquired companies.  Any changes in assumptions, estimates, or financial statement classifications may be material and have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities or future earnings of the new combined consolidated company.  Any potential decline in the Company's financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the Company's share price.The Company's results of operations and cash flow needs could be materially impacted by acquisitions. The Company's senior credit facilities, the agreements governing its senior notes and agreements governing its other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit the Company's ability to make distributions or other payments to its investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. The Company also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. These restrictions could affect the Company's ability to operate its business and may limit its ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions. If the Company does not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its senior credit facilities, agreements governing its senior notes and agreements governing its other indebtedness, the Company could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. Any default under the Company's senior credit facilities or agreements governing its senior notes or other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under  41other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the Company's indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that it would be able to repay or refinance its debt or obtain sufficient new financing. The Company has various maturity dates associated with its credit facilities, senior notes and other debt facilities. There is no assurance that cash, future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of its indebtedness. Further, there is no assurance that future refinancing or renegotiation of the Company's senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms. The Company has acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject the Company to losses and may result in an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.In addition to the $5.8 billion Tysabri® distribution and license agreement recorded as an intangible asset and described above, the Company also acquired investment securities and equity method investments, and recorded $2.3 billion of goodwill in connection with the Elan acquisition.  All of these assets are subject to impairment, which would adversely impact the Company's results of operations.  For intangible assets subject to amortization such as Tysabri®, an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.  Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known.  See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. If the Company determines that a loss in the value of its equity method investments is other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value.  Any such losses are recorded to other expense (income), net.  Evaluations of recoverability are based primarily on projected cash flows.  Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.  Additionally, the equity method of accounting requires the Company to record a proportionate share of the profits and losses of its equity method investments.  If the entities accounted for as equity method investments experience significant losses, the Company will have to record a proportionate share of those losses, which could significantly impact the Company's results of operations.Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally A substantial portion of the sources of raw materials and an increasing volume of sales of the Company are outside the U.S. Additional legislation or regulation concerning importing/exporting may be enacted, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's net sales and resulting income.  The Company imports and exports products and raw materials from/to several jurisdictions around the world. This process involves Company subsidiaries and third parties operating in a number of jurisdictions with different customs and import/export regulations. The regulations are subject to change from time to time and the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or impact of these changes upon the Company's operations. The Company is subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering these regulations. To the extent that the Company is unable to successfully defend itself against an audit or review, the Company may be required to pay assessments, penalties and increased duties, which may, individually or in the aggregate, negatively impact the Company's gross margins and operating results. Certain of the Company's facilities operate in a special purpose subzone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board, which allows the Company certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities. If the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board were to revoke the subzone designation or limit its use by the Company, the Company could be subject to increased duties, which may negatively impact the Company's gross margins and operating results.  42Conducting business in international markets involves risks and uncertainties such as foreign exchange rate exposure and social, political and economic instability that could lead to increased prices for raw materials, reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's net sales and resulting income.  The Company sources certain key raw materials and finished products from foreign suppliers in countries that include, but are not limited to, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, India and Mexico. The Company's primary markets for the sale of its products outside the U.S. are Canada, Germany, Israel, Mexico, the U.K., China and Australia. The Company may have difficulty in international markets due, for example, to regulatory barriers, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to markets with different cultural biases and political systems and strict adherence to all anti-corruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Violence and crime in Mexico could adversely affect the Company's manufacturing activities and ability to recruit and retain employees there. Sales to customers outside the U.S. and foreign raw material purchases expose the Company to a number of risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, possible difficulties in enforcing agreements, longer payment cycles, longer shipping lead-times, inefficient port operations, exchange rate fluctuations, difficulties obtaining export or import licenses, the imposition of withholding or other taxes, economic or political instability, embargoes, military hostilities or exchange controls. Should any of these risks occur, they may have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the Company. Conditions in Israel affect the Company's operations and may limit its ability to produce and sell its products.  The Company has significant manufacturing and research and development facilities in Israel. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect the Company's operations, and the Company could be adversely affected by current or future hostilities involving Israel or a significant recession or downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel.  Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel in recent years. These hostilities can adversely affect Israel's relationship with a number of countries in the region and elsewhere, as well as its relationship with international organizations.  While none of the Company's facilities in Israel have been directly affected by hostile operations, there can be no assurance that a further escalation of hostilities will not impact the Company's facilities. Currently there is conflict in Gaza, and Perrigo facilities are within the ranges of the rockets fired at Israel from Gaza.  Furthermore, the Company's employees in Israel include members of the Israeli military reserves, some of whom have been called up for active duty. If a significant number of the Company's employees in Israel are called up for active duty in the military, the Company's operations in Israel may be materially adversely affected.  Finally, travel, including FDA travel, has been disrupted or halted during the recent hostilities. Escalations of hostilities have disruptive effects on Israel's economy, and any international economic sanctions against Israel could further harm Israel's economy. These economic developments could have an adverse effect on the Company's Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products business.  Furthermore, certain parties with whom the Company does business may decline to travel to Israel, which would force the Company to make alternative arrangements where necessary. The United States Department of State has at times issued an advisory regarding travel to various sections of Israel. As a result of the State Department's advisories, the FDA has at various times curtailed or prohibited its inspectors from traveling to Israel to inspect the facilities of Israeli companies, and should this occur with respect to the Company's Israeli facilities, the FDA could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities.  Although it has not yet occurred, the political and security situation in Israel may result in certain parties with whom the Company has contracts claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments pursuant to force majeure provisions of those contracts.  The Company could experience disruption of its manufacturing and research and development facilities due to terrorist acts or military actions. If terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to the Company's facilities, business activities would be disrupted since, with respect to most products, the Company would need to obtain prior FDA approval for a change in manufacturing site. The Company's insurance may not  43adequately compensate it for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business.  Some neighboring countries, as well as certain companies and organizations, continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies. The Company is also precluded from marketing its products to certain of these countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions. Because an immaterial amount of the Company's revenue is currently derived from sales to these countries, the Company believes that the boycott has not had a material adverse effect on its current operations. However, continuation or extension of the boycott or implementation of additional restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses could have an adverse impact on the expansion of the Company's business.Risks Related to the Company's Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company's business requires continuous capital investments and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all. In some instances, the Company may determine to issue additional shares of capital stock in order to meet its capital needs, which would dilute existing shareholders' ownership.  The Company maintains a broad product line to function as a primary supplier for its customers. Capital investments are driven by growth, technological advancements, cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility. Estimation of future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors. If the Company fails to stay current with the latest manufacturing, information and packaging technology, it may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions.  The Company anticipates that cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company has historically evaluated acquisition opportunities and anticipates that acquisition opportunities will continue to be identified and evaluated in the future. The historical growth of sales and profits has been positively influenced by acquisitions. There is no assurance that future sales and profits will, or will not, be impacted by acquisition activities.       If the Company decides to seek additional capital through the issuance of additional ordinary shares, existing shareholders' ownership may be diluted. Changes in the Company's credit ratings may limit its access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs. The Company has received ratings from Moody's Investor Service and Standard and Poor's Rating Services.  Any changes or downgrades to the Company's credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the Company's access to capital markets and the perception of the Company's credit risk by lenders and other third parties. The Company's credit ratings are based upon information furnished by the Company or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to the Company due to developments that are beyond the Company's control, including the introduction of new standards requiring the agencies to re-assess rating practices and methodologies.Any downgrade to the ratings of the Company's debt securities may result in higher interest costs for certain of the Company's credit facilities and other debt financings, and could result in higher interest costs on future financings. Further, downgrades may impact the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing, including via trade payables with vendors. Customers' inclination to purchase goods from the Company may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of the Company's credit ratings.Customer channel consolidation, including retailers and buyers, can increase the Company's credit risk, which may adversely affect the Company's financial position or results of operations.                 Retailer and buyer consolidation continues to increase the size of the Company's customers. If a large customer should encounter financial difficulties, the Company's exposure with respect to uncollectible receivables  44and unusable inventory, as well as the potential loss of future sales, could result in a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions; weaknesses or downturns in the global economy could adversely impact the Company's liquidity and financial condition.  The Company’s business is impacted by economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries in which the Company produces and markets its products.  Slower economic growth, geopolitical issues, sovereign debt issues, and the state of global real estate markets may contribute to increased market volatility.  Although economic conditions have improved over the last few years, there continues to be uncertainty as to whether this improvement is sustainable. Continued market volatility could adversely affect the Company's stock price, liquidity and overall financial condition.  The Company's customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if the current economic conditions worsen. Although the Company actively reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and suppliers, the Company cannot fully predict to what extent its customers and suppliers may be negatively impacted and thus to what extent the Company's operations would be affected.  The Company invests cash and cash equivalents primarily in demand deposits and other short-term instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company typically maintains a balance between objectives of safety of principal, liquidity and return by investing primarily in U.S., federal, state and local government obligations, direct obligations of local sovereign governments and in bank obligations of the Company's credit banks meeting a minimum third-party credit rating standard. The value of the Company's assets may be adversely affected if economic conditions worsen.  Although the Company's lenders have made commitments to make funds available to the Company in a timely fashion, if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting these lenders' credit ratings or capital ratios, the Company's lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to the Company's existing credit facilities. In addition, if the Company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, the cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets may be more expensive or those markets may be unavailable. If the Company is unable to use its existing credit facilities or raise funds through debt or equity markets, the Company's liquidity or ability to follow its key growth strategies could be materially and adversely affected.  Additionally, decreases in personal incomes may have caused consumers to look for and purchase lower priced products, such as generic and store brand products manufactured by the Company, as an alternative to higher priced brand-name products. To the extent that this trend has occurred, the Company's sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and if consumers were enticed to go back to purchasing higher-priced brand-name products. Tax-Related RisksThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may not agree with the conclusion that the Company is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.Although the Company is incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code").  For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation.  Because the Company is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules.  Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.For the Company to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874 of the Code, either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the Company's stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the "ownership test") or (ii) the Company must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of the Company’s expanded affiliated group).  As of the acquisition date, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of the shares in the Company.   45As a result, the Company believes that under current law, it should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.  However, the Company cannot assure that the IRS will agree with the position that the ownership test is satisfied.  There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test.Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit the Company's and its U.S. affiliates’ ability to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition.Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions.  Based on the limited guidance available, the Company currently expects this limitation will apply, and as a result, the Company currently does not expect that it or its U.S. affiliates will be able to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset their U.S. taxable income, if any, resulting from certain specified taxable transactions. Changes in tax laws or income tax rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.  The Company believes that under current law, it should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.  However, changes to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, or the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance, could adversely affect the Company's status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to the Company, Perrigo Company, and/or their respective stockholders, shareholders and affiliates.  In addition, recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, and such legislation, if passed, could have an adverse effect on the Company.Moreover, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations.  One example is in the area of "base erosion and profit shifting", where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates.  As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect the Company.A number of factors may adversely impact the Company's future effective tax rates, such as income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which the Company's profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to the Company's interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (e.g., proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in the Company's effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact the Company's future results from operations. Also, changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made.  In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.   46The government programs in Israel in which the Company participates and the tax benefits the Company receives require the Company to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase the Company's costs and tax expenses.  The Company has received grants for research and development from the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade. To continue to be eligible for these grants, the Company's development projects must be approved by the Chief Scientist on a case-by-case basis. If the Company's development projects are not approved by the Chief Scientist, the Company will not receive grants to fund these projects, which would increase research and development costs. The receipt of such grants subjects the Company to certain restrictions and pre-approval requirements, which may be conditioned on additional royalty payments with rights to transfer intellectual property and/or production abroad. The Company also receives tax benefits, in particular exemptions and reductions, as a result of the Privileged Enterprise status of certain existing operations in Israel. To be eligible for these tax benefits, the Company must maintain its Privileged Enterprise status by meeting conditions, including making specified investments in fixed assets located in specific regions in Israel and investing additional equity in itself and its Israeli subsidiaries and by meeting projections provided to the regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to meet these conditions in the future, the tax benefits would be canceled, and the Company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received. These tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level. If such benefits are reduced or eliminated in the future, the Company's results of operations will be adversely impacted.  In fiscal 2011, Israel enacted new tax legislation that reduced the effective tax rate to 10% for 2011 and 2012, 7% for 2013 and 2014, and 6% thereafter for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation. This legislation was rescinded as announced in the Official Gazette on August 5, 2013. The new legislation enacted a 9% rate for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation. The Company has two entities that had previously elected the new tax legislation for years after fiscal 2011. Therefore, the above risk is only applicable for the Company for fiscal year 2011 as statutes remain open for this year. Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary SharesThe Company is incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders. The Company’s shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Acts 1963-2013 (the Act). The Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. For example, under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances. In addition, depending on the circumstances, shareholders may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax. The Company is incorporated in Ireland, and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against the Company or certain of the Company's officers and directors. The Company is incorporated in Ireland and a substantial portion of assets are located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, some of the officers and directors reside outside the U.S., and some or all of their respective assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors to enforce against the Company any judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.There is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Before a foreign judgment would be deemed enforceable in Ireland, the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction and be for a final and conclusive sum.  An Irish court may also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment. Further, an Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of  47liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.In certain limited circumstances, dividends paid by the Company may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends, if any, paid on Perrigo ordinary shares.  A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and shareholders resident in certain other countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax (the "Relevant Territories").Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Perrigo).  All U.S. resident shareholders in the Company that hold their shares outside of DTC and shareholders resident in other Relevant Territories will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the beneficial owners of such shares have furnished completed and valid dividend withholding tax forms and an IRS Form 6166, as appropriate, to the Company's transfer agent or their brokers (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to the Company's transfer agent).  However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, that could adversely affect the Company's share price.Dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.Most Irish tax resident or ordinarily resident shareholders (other than Irish resident companies that have completed the appropriate dividend withholding tax ("DWT" forms)) will be subject to DWT in respect of dividends received from the Company.  Shareholders that are residents of Ireland, but are entitled to received dividends without DWT, must complete the appropriate DWT forms and provide them to their brokers before the record date for the dividend, or to the Company’s transfer agent at least seven business days before the record date for the dividend.Shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland but who are not entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends which suffer dividend withholding tax. Perrigo ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.Irish capital acquisitions tax ("CAT") could apply to a gift or inheritance of Perrigo ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties.  This is because Perrigo ordinary shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland.  The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT.  Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT.  Children have a tax-free threshold of €225,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. Risks Related to the Company's Corporate StructureA number of factors may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends in the future. The Company recently created distributable reserves by means of a reduction of share capital that was approved by the shareholders of the Company and the Irish High Court. In the event the Company chooses to seek to create further distributable reserves by means of a capital reduction, this will also require Irish High Court approval and shareholder approval. The Company is not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the further creation of additional distributable reserves by means of a further capital reduction; however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court. There also can be no guarantee that shareholder approval will be obtained.The Company’s ability to pay dividends will be limited by the availability of distributable reserves. Although distributable reserves can be created by means of a reduction in capital, the ongoing availability of distributable reserves will depend on whether the Company has, on an individual entity basis, "profits available for  48distribution" (within the meaning of the Irish Companies Acts); however, the future generation of additional distributable reserves cannot be guaranteed. The Company is a holding company that does not expect to conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, the Company will be dependent on cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from its subsidiaries in order to pay dividends to its shareholders. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable laws (including the Irish Companies Acts) and covenants under current or future credit facilities, which may restrict or limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends. The determination also will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the Company’s board of directors may deem relevant. Irish shareholder voting requirements may limit the Company's flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.Under Irish law, the authorized share capital of the Company can be increased by an ordinary resolution of its shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association of the Company or by an ordinary resolution of the Company's shareholders.  Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights by way of special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares.  Accordingly, the Company's articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, a provision authorizing the board to issue new shares for cash without offering preemption rights.  The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and the Company cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit the Company's ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of the Company's securities.
