.COMPETITIVE CONDITIONSWe compete with many companies in the defense industry and the intelligence and civil markets. Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation, L-3 Communications Corporation, SAIC, BAE Systems Inc., EADS, and Finmeccanica SpA are our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards) and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities. It is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. SEASONALITYNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. BACKLOGTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog, until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. For multi-year service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made. At December 31, 2012, total backlog was $40.8 billion, compared with $39.5 billion at the end of 2011. Approximately $21.4 billion of our backlog at December 31, 2012, is expected to be converted into sales in 2013. For backlog by segment, see Backlog in Part II, Item 7.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTOur research and development activities primarily include independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related to U.S. Government programs. Company-sponsored IR&D efforts are included in general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to U.S. Government contracts, while customer-sponsored research and development efforts are charged directly to the related contracts. Company-sponsored IR&D expenses totaled $520 million, $543 million, and $580 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. PATENTSWe routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual 4Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATIONproperty rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government generally holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts, and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would, in our opinion, have a material impact on our business. See Risk Factors in Part I,  and Overview – Outlook in Part II, Item 7.EMPLOYEE RELATIONSWe believe that we maintain good relations with our 68,100 employees, of which approximately 3,300 are covered by 17 collective bargaining agreements. We negotiated or re-negotiated eight of our collective bargaining agreements in 2012 and expect to re-negotiate renewals for three of our collective bargaining agreements in 2013. These negotiations had no material adverse effect on our results of operations. For risks associated with collective bargaining agreements, see Risk Factors in Part I, .Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Form 10-K reflect the operating results of our entire company, including such restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).ContractsWe generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government for development, production, and support activities. Due to the long-term nature of our contracts with the U.S. Government and the products and services covered by these contracts, we generally recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under the percentage of completion method of accounting, revenues are generally recognized as costs are incurred (cost-to-cost method) or as units are delivered (units-of-delivery method). Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. Government under the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, advertising costs and interest expense. Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories:Cost-type contracts – Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, award fee, and incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee. Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or 5Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATIONpercentage of costs. Award fees are based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company's performance against negotiated criteria, and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. Incentive fees provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. Award fees and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Fixed-price contracts – A firm fixed-price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes in scope by the customer. Fixed-price incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a ceiling amount, but are subject to a cost-share limit that affects profitability. Fixed-price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share limit is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.The following table summarizes revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, recognized by contract type and customer:($ in millions) U.S.Government OtherCustomers Total Percent of TotalCost-type contracts        $13,732          $283        $14,015 56%Fixed-price contracts 8,976 2,227 11,203 44%Total sales        $22,708          $2,510        $25,218 100%Profit margins may vary materially depending on, among other things, the negotiated contract fee arrangements, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.We monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations and laws. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).EnvironmentalOur manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The estimated cost to complete remediation is accrued when it is probable that the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts at sites where the company has been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and the costs are estimable. To assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements, management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company, taking into account the facts currently available to the company regarding each site, as well as the current state of technology and prior experience. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. See Risk Factors in Part I, . Risk FactorsOur consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We urge you to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.▪We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. Government, for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in this customer’s priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our primary customer is the U.S. Government, from which we derived more than 90 percent of our total revenues during each of the past several years. The U.S. Government is implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes. We cannot predict the impact on existing, follow-on, replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels, military strategy and planning, and/or changes in social-political priorities. A shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for its convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the U.S. Government’s convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. In some circumstances, however, a U.S. government contract does not have such termination protection. In those cases, we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means. To the extent such means are unavailable or do not fully address the costs incurred or profit on those costs, we could face significant losses from the termination for convenience of a contract that lacks termination protection. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract for convenience also could result in the cancellation of future work on that program. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract, as well as other damages. Termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to material liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts.The U.S. Government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. It is possible that the U.S. Government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in this challenging fiscal environment. In the event of a stop work order, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract. However, such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the U.S. Government, and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts. In this 7Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATIONchallenging environment, our industry could face a significant number of terminations, change orders and stop work orders, which by their volume could further delay and jeopardize our industry's ability to recover costs.▪Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. Government funding more broadly may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.U.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by Congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions, as applicable. The impact, severity and duration of the current U.S. economic situation and plans adopted by the U.S. Government, along with pressures on, and uncertainty surrounding, the federal budget and the permissible federal debt limit, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. In the event that government funding for any of our programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government or the prime contractor, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, if the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments. An extended delay in the timely payment of billings by the U.S. Government would likely result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act which, while raising the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt, also committed the U.S. Government to significantly reducing the federal deficit over ten years. The Budget Control Act established caps on discretionary spending through 2021, reducing federal spending by approximately $1 trillion over that period relative to the fiscal year (FY) 2012 Presidential budget submission, and called for very substantial automatic spending cuts, known as "sequestration," split between defense and non-defense programs. In January 2013, Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. It addressed a number of tax code provisions and certain spending issues, but left in place the sequester (although delaying its implementation to March 1, 2013) and did not address other fiscal matters such as the debt ceiling. The delay in the sequester leaves the DoD less time to enact 2013 automatic spending cuts and adds to the uncertainty from such cuts. The nation's debt ceiling is currently expected to be reached during the first half of 2013. Congress and the Administration continue to debate these issues and the terms of a possible national fiscal approach. The outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans. While the President's proposed FY 2014 Budget is scheduled for release in February 2013, its delivery may be delayed given these unresolved fiscal matters.We are unable to predict the impact that the delayed automatic cuts or other defense spending cuts would have on funding for our individual programs. Long-term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed or cancelled. In addition, these cuts could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors. While we believe that our business is well-positioned in areas that the DoD has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending, the impact of the Budget Control Act and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain and our business and industry could be materially adversely affected. The President's proposed budget for FY 2013 represented a slight decline from FY 2012 levels. Although Congress passed a continuing resolution to fund U.S. Government operations through March 27, 2013, it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed during FY 2013. The U.S. Government may operate under a continuing resolution for all of FY 2013, potentially resulting in no new contract or program starts for that year. The Congressional budget process has been marked by significant debate within the government regarding FY 2013 defense spending. Budget decisions made in this environment will likely have long-term consequences for our company and the entire defense industry. Should sequestration as currently mandated be implemented in March 2013, absent any other changes, we believe it would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country, the defense industrial base, including Northrop Grumman, and the customers, employees, suppliers, 8Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATIONinvestors, and communities that rely on the companies in the defense industrial base. There are many variables in how the law could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts; however, we expect that sequestration, as currently provided for under the Budget Control Act, would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company. Such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill.▪As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various procurement regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation.U.S. Government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements. These regulations and requirements, although customary in government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. New regulations or procurement requirements (including, for example, counterfeit parts and conflict minerals) or changes to current ones, could increase our costs and risks and reduce our margins. Failure to comply with these regulations could, among other things, result in the withholding of payments and adversely impact our reputation and ability to participate in future U.S. Government contracts.We operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and DoD Inspector General. These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. Government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. Government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. If such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are from time to time subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations, and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including but not limited to the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are found to have violated the law, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties, fines, or compensatory or treble damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such matters could also result in suspension or debarment. Given our dependence on government contracting and authorizations, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.▪Changes to business practices for U.S. Government contractors could have a significant adverse effect on current programs, potential new awards and the processes by which procurements are awarded and managed.Our industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, and recovery of costs, among other items, and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending. For example, the DoD’s Better Buying Power Initiative continues to evolve in its efforts to reduce costs, gain efficiencies, refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the DoD, including those used to procure goods, services and solutions from defense contractors. In addition, the DCMA has implemented cost recovery initiatives designed to prioritize efforts to recover costs and close open audits. As a result of certain of these initiatives, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and/or a lengthened period of time required to close open audits. More recently, the thresholds for certain allowable costs are being challenged and refined.These efforts have had, and we expect them to continue to have, a significant impact on the contracting environment in which we do business. In support of the implementation of the Better Buying Power Initiative, the U.S. Government is issuing new regulations and requirements that are shifting additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor. While the impact to our business as a result of these changes remains uncertain, our business and industry could be materially adversely affected.9Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Competition within our markets and an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share.We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities or be willing to accept more risk or lower margins in competing for contracts. We have seen, and anticipate that we will continue to see, increased competition in some of our core markets, especially as a result of the reduction in budgets for many U.S. Government agencies and fewer new program starts. Changes in U.S. defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities. We are facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from U.S., foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work, or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we will experience declines in revenues and market share, which would negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We also are seeing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense to the company, contract modifications or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings.▪Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and new technologies and maintain technologies, facilities, equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers.Many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services, as well as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. If we fail to maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share.Our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills and/or security clearances. If qualified personnel become scarce, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. Failure to maintain a qualified workforce would result in difficulty in performing under our contracts.Approximately 3,300 of our 68,100 employees are covered by an aggregate of 17 collective bargaining agreements, and we expect to negotiate or re-negotiate renewals for three of our collective bargaining agreements in 2013. Collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years, and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration. We may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements. If we experience such difficulties, we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages. Any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.▪Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements.In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. Examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance. These failures could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received.10Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATIONCertain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems, contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time. Under such terms, we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized and/or collected. We have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions. However, if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future, for example, such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.▪Contract cost growth on fixed-price and other contracts that do not result in increased contract value exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.Our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers. This cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase or initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, technical or quality issues, the timeliness and availability of materials, major subcontractor performance and quality of their products, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and natural disasters. Further, items affecting our contract value may include the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our risk varies with the type of contract. Due to their nature, firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than cost type contracts. In 2012, approximately 44 percent of our annual revenues were derived from fixed-price contracts. We typically enter into fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience. In addition, our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. Should the terms specified in our contracts not be met, then profitability may be reduced or a loss may be incurred. Fixed-price development work comprises a small portion of our fixed-price contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage. As work progresses through the development stage into production, the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced. While management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed-price development contracts, future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates.Other contracts are also subject to risk, for example, under a fixed price incentive contract, the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are paid up to a ceiling, which can affect profitability. Further, under a cost type contract, the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee. We often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges. These cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise.▪We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position.When agreeing to contractual terms, we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. These assumptions and projections assess the cost, productivity and availability of labor, future levels of business base, complexity of the work to be performed, cost and availability of materials, impact of potential delays in performance and timing of product deliveries. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Incentives, awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates.Because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and our performance. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.11Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Our earnings and margins depend, in part, on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.We rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations on time as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner.Our costs may increase over the term of our contracts. Through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our U.S. Government contracts, we may be protected from increases in costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices. However, the difference in basis between our actual costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these provisions. A significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials or components required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.In connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. There are currently several components for which there may only be one supplier. If a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative. Consistent with the industry’s efforts, our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit parts or materials. If we are unable to procure needed materials, components or parts, or if the parts we procure are counterfeit, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Changes in economic conditions, as well as changes in the defense budget, can adversely affect the ability of our subcontractors and suppliers to perform and further increase this risk.▪Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for approximately half of our recorded total assets. We test goodwill amounts for impairment at least annually and consider whether an interim test is required if we believe potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. We face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the U.S. Government, our primary customer, including the potential for sequestration and issues surrounding the national debt ceiling. Potential contract cancellations, modifications or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues, profits and cash flows to be substantially lower than our current projections. In addition, market-based inputs to the calculations in the impairment test, such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value (based on market comparisons) could also be negatively impacted. Such circumstances may result in an impairment of our goodwill. Further, the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors including the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability. Therefore an increase in the discount rate on our pension liability in 2013 or beyond could result in an impairment of goodwill absent any changes discussed above. We continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time, acquire an interest in a business. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates and we may experience unforeseen issues that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long-lived assets.12Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Our international business exposes us to additional risks.Our international business remains subject to numerous political and economic factors, regulatory requirements and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Our international business is subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in regulations, political environments or security risks may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets, including those regarding investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings. Our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and may be further impacted by global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements.The services and products we provide internationally, including those provided by subcontractors, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, in areas of military conflict or at military installations. This increases the risk of an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties or damage to our products. We maintain insurance and take other steps to mitigate the risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations, but these steps may not be adequate to prevent loss or to cover resulting claims and liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs (see additional discussion of possible inadequacy of our insurance coverage below). In addition, any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity for the company, which may adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.▪Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners.We have implemented extensive policies, procedures, training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others with whom we are doing business that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, cost accounting and billing, competition and data privacy. However, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents or others with whom we are doing business, and the risk of improper conduct may increase in the current environment. Such improper actions could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties, including suspension and debarment, which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.13Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including physical and cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.As a defense contractor, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information; threats to the safety of our directors, officers, and employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities, harm to personnel or infrastructure, or damage to our reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.We also manage information technology systems for various customers and other third parties. While we operate under information security policies and procedures for managing these systems, we generally face similar cybersecurity threats for these systems as for our own.▪Unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs.Environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. In addition, if we were found to be in violation of the Federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the EPA on the “Excluded Parties List” maintained by the General Services Administration. The listing could continue until the EPA concludes that the cause of the violation had been corrected. If we were listed on the Excluded Parties List it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Listed facilities generally cannot be used in performing any U.S. Government contract until the violation is corrected.The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, sanctions or penalties, could negatively impact our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.14Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪We are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us.The size, nature and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to claims and litigation. We are and may become subject to various environmental claims, income tax matters, compliance matters, claims, investigations, and administrative, civil or criminal litigation, which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of the company's reliance on government contracts and authorizations. Investigations, claims or litigation, if ultimately resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any investigation, claim, or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.▪We may be unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.We own many U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property, and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property. The U.S. Government appears to be asserting or seeking to assert more extensive intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties.We also rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors and other parties, as well as through other measures. These agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information. In the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. In some instances, we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others, but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights, against claims by the U.S. Government or others our business could be adversely affected.▪Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters, environmental disasters and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.We have significant operations located in regions of the U.S. that may be exposed to earthquakes, damaging storms, and other natural disasters, including environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. If insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract. Performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract. This could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer, could result in a termination of the prime contract and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.Natural disasters could also disrupt our workforce, electrical and other power distribution networks, including computer and internet operation and accessibility, and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations. These disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance.15Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Our insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of or be unable to pay for material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position.We endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities (including, for example, natural disasters and product liability). Not every risk or liability can be insured, and, for risks that are insurable, the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us.  Disputes with insurance carriers over policy terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of cash flows and, if litigation over coverage terms with the insurer becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws, regulations or otherwise. However, these protections are typically subject to certain terms or limitations and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred.▪Anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, spin-offs or strategic alliances may not be realized.As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time, merge with or acquire businesses, dispose of or spin-off businesses, form joint ventures or create strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, the management of the operations and market conditions following these transactions. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, transaction-related charges, liabilities, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through guarantees, indemnifications, or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Although we have established procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful.▪Market volatility and adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our suppliers' ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers.A tightening of credit could adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing. Delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers.▪Pension and medical expenses associated with our retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending upon changes in actuarial assumptions, future investment performance of plan assets, future trends in health care costs and legislative or other regulatory actions.A substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the costs of which are dependent upon our various assumptions, including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs. In addition, funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. Variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Additionally, due to government regulations, pension plan cost recoveries under our government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. These timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. In December 2011, the cost accounting rules were revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to U.S. Government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006. We anticipate that this rule will better align, but not eliminate, mismatches between ERISA funding requirements and CAS pension costs for U.S. Government CAS covered contracts. 16Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in applicable domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Deferred tax assets are required to be measured at the statutory tax rate currently in effect, therefore a change in the U.S. corporate tax rate would result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset through the income tax provision. The final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income, the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and significantly affect our income tax expense, profitability and cash flow. ▪Our nuclear-related operations subject us to various environmental, regulatory, financial and other risks.Our nuclear-related operations subject us to various risks, including potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclear-related operations and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. We are also subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident, whether or not it is within our control. The U.S. Government and prime contractors provide certain indemnity protection under certain of our contracts pursuant to, or in connection with, Public Law 85-804 and the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act for certain nuclear-related risks. If there was a nuclear incident and that indemnity protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.▪If all or any portion of the spin-off of our former Shipbuilding business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off transaction are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax may incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.In connection with the spin-off of our former Shipbuilding business, we received a letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, the internal reorganization or the distribution, except that our shareholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash. The ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and HII regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters.We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the factual statements or representations in the IRS ruling or the opinion to be incomplete or untrue at the time of the spin-off transaction. Nevertheless, if the IRS determines that any of the factual statements or representations that the IRS ruling or the opinion was based on were incomplete or untrue, or if certain facts or circumstances upon which the IRS ruling or the opinion was based were materially different from those at the time of the spin-off, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling or the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Even if the spin-off transaction otherwise qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the internal reorganization and distribution may be taxable to us (but not to our shareholders) if certain events occur, including, if before March 31, 2013 there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either us or HII, representing 50% or more of the then-outstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution; we cease to engage appropriately in the conduct of a substantial part of our existing business; or, we or HII repurchase shares in excess of specified levels before March 31, 2013. If such tax were incurred, the tax liability would be substantial. HII has agreed not to undertake transactions that would reasonably be expected to trigger such tax, and we intend to avoid any such transactions.17Table of ContentsNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION▪The spin-off of our former Shipbuilding business may expose us to potential claims and liabilities.In connection with the spin-off transaction, we entered into a number of agreements with HII setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation. For example, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, from and after the spin-off transaction, each of HII and Northrop Grumman is generally responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spin-off. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and HII, and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to HII (for example, tax and/or environmental liabilities), particularly if HII were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations.In addition, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which HII has agreed to be responsible and/or to indemnify us, directly or indirectly. The indemnity related rights we have under our agreements with HII may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from HII or the U.S. Government any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid. In addition, certain indemnities that we may be required to provide HII are not subject to a cap, may be significant, and could negatively impact our business. These risks could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Item 1B
