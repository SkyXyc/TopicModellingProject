Item 1A.Risk FactorsThe price of KCS’s common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock when they choose to or at prices they find attractive.The price of KCS’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), listed under the ticker symbol “KSU”, constantly changes. The Company expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate.The Company’s stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCS’s control. These factors include, but are not limited to:•quarterly variations in operating results;•operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;•changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates by management, securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;•developments generally affecting the railroad industry;•announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings involving KCS;•KCS’s dividend policy and limitations on the payment of dividends;•future sales of KCS’s equity or equity-linked securities;•general domestic and international economic conditions including the availability of short and long-term financing.In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of KCS’s common stock.KCS’s ability to continue to pay cash dividends on its common stock may be limited.KCS has agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to limitations on its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock. While KCS is currently paying dividends, there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so in the future.Sales of substantial amounts of KCS's common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.As of December 31, 2014, there were 5,517,716 shares of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan, the 2008 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1,405,169 shares of common stock held by executive officers and directors outside those plans. Sales of common stock by employees upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and directors, and sales of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of KCS' common stock.KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a controlling interest in KCS and that could deprive an investor of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of KCS’s common stock.KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. The bylaws provide that a stockholder must give the Company advance written notice of its intent to nominate a director or raise a matter at an annual meeting. These provisions may deprive KCS’s stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.KCS competes against other railroads and other transportation providers.The Company’s domestic and international operations are subject to competition from other railroads, particularly Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) and BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”) in the United States and Ferromex and Ferrosur in Mexico, as well as from truck carriers, barge lines, and other maritime shippers. Many of KCS’s rail competitors are much  10Table of Contentslarger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than KCS, which may enable rail competitors to reduce rates and make KCS’s freight services less competitive. KCS’s ability to respond to competitive pressures by matching rate reductions and decreasing rates without adversely affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on, among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs. KCS’s failure to respond to competitive pressures, and particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.The railroad industry is dominated by a few large carriers. These larger railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to block other railroads’ access to efficient gateways and routing options that are currently and have historically been available. In addition, if there is future consolidation in the railroad industry in the United States or Mexico, there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Trucking, maritime, and barge competitors, while able to provide rate and service competition to the railroad industry, are able to use public rights-of-way, require substantially smaller capital investment and maintenance expenditures than railroads and allow for more frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing competitive pressures, any reduction in margins due to competitive pressures, future improvements that increase the quality of alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which the Company operates, or legislation or regulations that provide motor carriers with additional advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and reduced weight restrictions, could result in downward pressure on freight rates, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.A key part of KCS’s growth strategy is based upon the conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance the Company will succeed in its efforts to convert traffic from truck to rail transport or that the customers already converted will be retained. If the railroad industry in general is unable to preserve its competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry, revenue growth could be adversely affected. Additionally, revenue growth could be affected by, among other factors, an expansion in the availability, or an improvement in the quality, of the trucking services offered by carriers resulting from regulatory and administrative interpretations and implementation of certain provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), and KCS’s inability to grow its existing customer base and capture additional cargo transport market share because of competition from the shipping industry and other railroads.KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.KCSM operates under the Concession granted by the Mexican government until June 2047, which is renewable for an additional period of up to 50 years, subject to certain conditions. The Concession gives KCSM exclusive rights to provide freight transportation services over its rail lines for the first 30 years of the 50-year Concession, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires. The SCT, which is principally responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, has broad powers to monitor KCSM’s compliance with the Concession, and it can require KCSM to supply it with any technical, administrative and financial information it requests. Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment commitments established in its business plan, which forms an integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every five years. The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans confidentially. The SCT also monitors KCSM’s compliance with efficiency and safety standards established in the Concession. The SCT reviews, and may amend, these standards every five years.The Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide the Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM under the Concession, including the right to take over the management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to other privatized industries, including the telecommunications industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In addition, under Article 47 of the Mexican Railroad Services Law and its regulations, if the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (Mexican Antitrust Commission or “CFCE”) determines that effective competition does not exist, then the SCT has authority to set rates. CFCE, however, has not published guidelines regarding the factors that constitute a lack of competition. It is, therefore, unclear under what particular circumstances CFCE would deem a lack of competition to exist. If the SCT intervenes and sets service rates, the rates it sets may negatively impact profitability. 11Table of ContentsUnder the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. All other property not covered by the Concession, including all locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, would remain KCSM’s property. In the event of early termination, or total or partial revocation of the Concession, the Mexican government would have the right to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for additional one-year terms up to five years. The amount of rent would be determined by experts appointed by KCSM and the Mexican government. The Mexican government must exercise this right within four months after early termination or revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican government would also have a right of first refusal with respect to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within 90 days after revocation of the Concession.The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in such manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause other than international war, the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide that the Mexican government will indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not be made timely.The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is sanctioned on a specified number of occasions for any of the following: unjustly interrupting the operation of its rail lines or for charging rates higher than those it has registered with the SCT; restricting the ability of other Mexican rail operators to use its rail lines; failing to make payments for damages caused during the performance of services; failing to comply with any term or condition of the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations or the Concession; failing to make the capital investments required under its five-year business plan filed with the SCT; or failing to maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage as specified in the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or creates any lien on the Concession, or if there is a change in control of KCSM without the SCT’s approval. The SCT may also terminate the Concession as a result of KCSM’s surrender of its rights under the Concession, or for reasons of public interest or upon KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy. If the Concession is terminated or revoked by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no compensation and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by it, would revert to the Mexican government. Revocation or termination of the Concession would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would materially adversely affect the Mexican operations and the ability to make payments on KCSM’s debt as well as materially adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties. Operation of KCS’s rail network and its plans for growth and expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances, as well as interchange, trackage rights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage the Company does not own. KCS’s ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with other railroads and third parties, and upon the performance of the obligations under the agreements by the other railroads and third parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements. KCS is also dependent in part upon the financial strength and efficient performance of other railroads. There can be no assurance that KCS will not be materially adversely affected by operational or financial difficulties of other railroads.KCSM’s operations are subject to certain trackage rights, haulage rights and interline service agreements with another Mexican rail carrier, some of which are in dispute.Through KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM is required to grant short and long distance trackage rights to Ferromex. Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex similarly is required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of its tracks. These trackage rights have been granted under the Concession. The rates to be charged for use of the Trackage Rights after January 1, 2009, were agreed to by KCSM and Ferromex pursuant to the Trackage Rights Agreement, dated February 9, 2010. The Trackage Rights Agreement did not establish rates that may be charged for the right to use the trackage rights for the periods beginning in 1998 through December 31, 2008. 12Table of ContentsIf KCSM cannot reach an agreement with Ferromex for rates applicable for services provided prior to January 1, 2009, which are not subject to the Trackage Rights Agreement, the SCT is entitled to set the rates in accordance with Mexican law and regulations, which rates may not adequately compensate KCSM. KCSM is currently involved in legal proceedings with the SCT regarding the amounts payable to Ferromex for trackage rights, interline services and haulage rights for periods prior to January 1, 2009. Certain of these disputes continue under litigation. Any resolution of such procedures adverse to KCSM could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements in a particular quarter or fiscal year.A downturn in the debt capital markets or a downgrade of the Company’s credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing and make financing difficult to obtain.Events in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on the debt capital markets and, as a result, credit may become more expensive and difficult to obtain. Lenders may impose more stringent restrictions on the terms of credit and there may be a general reduction in the amount of credit available in the markets in which KCS conducts business. Also, the Company and its securities are rated by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). These ratings impact the Company’s cost of funds and its access to the debt capital markets. The negative impact of tightening credit markets, adverse changes in the debt capital markets generally and/or a downgrade of the Company’s credit ratings may have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements resulting from, but not limited to, an inability to finance capital expansion on favorable terms, if at all, reduced liquidity as a result of limited alternatives to refinance short-term debt, increased financing costs and/or financial terms with increasingly restrictive covenants.KCS’s business is capital intensive.The Company’s business is capital intensive and requires substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things, additions and improvements to roadway, equipment, structures and technology and maintenance of equipment and the rail system. KCS’s failure to make necessary capital expenditures to maintain its operations could impair its ability to serve existing customers, accommodate increases in traffic volumes or result in increased derailments.KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM fails to make such capital investments, KCSM’s business plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk, requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with the capital investment commitments in its business plan could result in sanctions imposed by the SCT, and could result in revocation of the Concession if sanctions are imposed on a specified number of occasions. The Company cannot assure that the Mexican government would grant any such permission or waiver. If such permission or waiver is not obtained in any instance and KCSM is sanctioned, its Concession might be at risk of revocation, which would materially adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements. See “KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances.”KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund capital expenditures with operating cash flows, short and long-term debt and equipment leases. KCS may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations or obtain sufficient funds from external sources to fund capital expenditure requirements. Even if financing is available, it may not be obtainable on acceptable terms and within the limitations contained in the indentures and other agreements relating to KCS’s existing debt.KCS is dependent on certain key suppliers of core rail equipment.KCS relies on a limited number of suppliers of core rail equipment (including locomotives, rolling stock equipment, rail and ties). The capital intensive nature and complexity of such equipment creates high barriers of entry for any potential new suppliers. If any of KCS’s suppliers discontinue production or experience capacity or supply shortages, this could result in increased costs or difficulty in obtaining rail equipment and materials, which could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS depends on the stability, availability and security of its information technology systems to operate its business.KCS relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of its information technology systems, including its computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security failures, regulatory compliance failures or other operational difficulties. 13Table of ContentsThe security risks associated with information technology systems have increased in recent years because of the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of KCS’s information technology security systems, or those of its third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or unauthorized access to its network could disrupt KCS’s business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase its costs and/or cause losses. KCS also confronts the risk that a terrorist or other third parties may seek to use its property, including KCS’s information technology systems, to inflict major harm.KCS continually takes steps to make appropriate enhancements to its information technology systems; however, KCS’s systems may be vulnerable to disruption, failure or unauthorized access which could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business may be adversely affected by changes in general economic, weather or other conditions. KCS’s operations may be adversely affected by changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican economies affects the businesses served by KCS. Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets, including the availability of short and long-term debt financing, may affect KCS, as well as the producers and consumers of the commodities that KCS transports and may have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although transportation markets are affected by general economic conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each particular market that may influence operating results. Some of KCS’s customers do business in industries that are highly cyclical, including the energy, automotive, housing and agriculture industries. Any downturn or change in government policy in these industries could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also, some of the products transported have had a historical pattern of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the general economic environment and by industry capacity and demand. KCS cannot assure that prices and demand for these products will not decline in the future, adversely affecting those industries and, in turn, the Company’s consolidated financial statements.The Company’s operations may also be affected by natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in and along the Gulf of Mexico, and its facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather conditions that could also adversely affect KCS’s shipping, agricultural, chemical and other customers. Significant reductions in the volume of rail shipments due to economic, weather, or other conditions could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business may be affected by market and regulatory responses to climate change. KCS’s operations may be adversely affected by restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust. Restrictions on emissions could also affect KCS’s customers that use commodities that KCS transports to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities KCS transports, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities KCS transports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain customers and their respective markets for certain commodities KCS transports in an unpredictable manner that could alter traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Any of these factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business is subject to credit risk, including the risk that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations when due. Customers and counterparties that owe the Company money may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Although the Company has procedures for reviewing its credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or  14Table of Contentscircumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Some of the Company’s risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by the Company. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one customer or counterparty could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other customers or counterparties, which in turn could adversely affect the Company. The Company may be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default by its customers and counterparties.KCS’s business is subject to legislation enacted by Congress and state legislatures, and is subject to regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including environmental, health, safety and tax laws, and regulations that could require KCS to incur material costs or liabilities. KCS is subject to legislation enacted by federal or state legislatures in the U.S. and Mexico, and is subject to regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to railroad operations including the U.S. Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board, Federal Railroad Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Homeland Security and others in the United States, the SCT in Mexico, as well as a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and other matters. Government regulation of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the competitiveness and profitability of railroads. As an example, various proposals submitted to the STB for consideration could have a negative impact on KCS’s ability to negotiate prices for rail services and affect competition among rail carriers, which could result in a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.Additional or new economic regulation by the U.S. Congress or the Surface Transportation Board in the U.S. or by the Mexican Congress of the Union or the SCT (or other agencies) in Mexico in current or future proceedings could change the regulatory framework within which the Company operates which could materially change the Company's business and have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.In Mexico, proposed legislation was introduced in 2013 in the House of Deputies to amend certain provisions in the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law. In February 2014, this proposed legislation was approved by the Mexican House of Deputies and was sent to the Mexican Senate. On December 14, 2014, the Mexican Senate passed a revised version of the House of Deputies’ bill, and on December 15, 2014, the House of Deputies passed the bill as amended by the Senate. On January 26, 2015, the bill was published in the Official Federal Gazette (Diario Oficial de la Federacion) and became law. It is too early to determine at this time how this legislation would be implemented and interpreted and thus what, if any, effect the rail legislation could have on the Mexican railroad industry and its customers.In May 2014, new Mexican antitrust legislation was approved and became effective on July 7, 2014. This new law replaces antitrust law that had been effective since 1993. While the Company continues to evaluate the Mexican government’s implementation of this legislation, the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.In response to several accidents involving the transportation of energy products by rail, U.S. rail and petroleum industry leaders met with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation in January 2014 to discuss voluntary actions to improve the transportation of energy products by rail. Additionally, in August 2013, the FRA issued Emergency Order 28 implementing new operating rules governing the transportation of energy products by rail. On August 1, 2014, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation published for public comment new proposed rules on transportation of flammable liquids (including crude oil and ethanol) by rail. The proposed rules included new tank car standards, possible new speed restrictions and possible new braking requirements for trains carrying 20 or more carloads of Class 3 flammable liquids. Public comments have been received by PHMSA, and that agency is considering what final rules to propose. Any proposed new regulations or continued operating practice changes by U.S. railroads related to the transportation of energy products by rail, if ultimately adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  15Table of ContentsAs part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, Class I railroad carriers and passenger and commuter rail operators must implement PTC (a technology designed to help prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned) at certain locations (including main line track where toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard movements occur or where passenger operations occur) by the end of 2015. PTC will add to operating costs, increase the number of employees the Company employs and require KCS to make significant investments in new safety technology. The U.S. rail industry, including KCS, has publicly stated it does not currently believe that PTC can be fully implemented by December 31, 2015 due to the many difficulties developing and deploying this inter-operable technology across the U.S. rail system. KCS, along with other Class I railroads in the United States, is working with the FRA and Congress to seek an extension of the deadline for implementing PTC. KCS’s failure to meet the deadline, including any extension, could result in fines or penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s inadvertent failure or inability to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and operations, including limitations on operating activities until compliance with applicable requirements is achieved. These government agencies may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which the Company operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on the Company’s business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure to obtain or maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations could adversely affect KCS’s business.From time to time, certain KCS facilities have not been in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that KCS will always be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. Environmental liability under federal and state law in the United States can also extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. Given the nature of its business, the Company incurs, and expects to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs, including, in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance with requirements governing chemical and hazardous material shipping operations, refueling operations and repair facilities. KCS presently has environmental investigation and remediation obligations at certain sites, and will likely incur such obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s best estimate of the probable future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded liability is the best estimate of all probable costs, clean-up costs may exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the extent of other parties’ participation, developments in environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective action that may ultimately be required. New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, accidental spills, releases or violations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require KCS to incur costs or subject KCS to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including standards for, among other things, water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. Under applicable Mexican law and regulations, administrative and criminal proceedings may be brought and economic sanctions imposed against companies that violate environmental laws, and non-complying facilities may be temporarily or permanently closed. KCSM is also subject to the laws of various jurisdictions with respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments of each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities are located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government also impose environmental compliance obligations on KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. Failure to comply with any environmental laws or regulations may result in the termination of KCSM’s Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect profitability.KCS is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and Mexico. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, and revisions of tax regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the final determination of tax audits, claims or litigation could differ from what is reflected in KCS’s financial statements. 16Table of ContentsKCS, as a common carrier by rail, is required by United States and Mexican laws to transport hazardous materials, which could expose KCS to significant costs and claims.Under United States federal statutes and applicable Mexican laws, KCS’s common carrier responsibility requires it to transport hazardous materials. Any rail accident or other incident or accident on KCS’s network, facilities, or at the facilities of KCS’s customers involving the release of hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard (or TIH) materials, could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of the Company’s insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business is vulnerable to fluctuations in fuel costs and disruptions in fuel supplies.  KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and these costs represent a significant portion of its transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel may have a material adverse effect on operating results. If KCS is unable to recapture its costs of fuel from its customers, operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a severe disruption of fuel supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a disruption of oil imports, weather events, war, or otherwise, and the resulting impact on fuel prices could materially adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel requirements for its Mexican operations through purchases at market prices from PEMEX Refinación (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico, a government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration based on market prices. Either party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is terminated and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from alternate sources on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations could be materially adversely affected.In addition, a significant and sustained decrease in crude oil prices could adversely affect the transport of crude oil by rail to the U.S. Gulf region as well as negatively impact railroad volumes related to equipment and other materials that support crude oil production. These factors could in turn adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Market fluctuations could adversely impact KCS's operating results as it hedges certain transactions.From time to time, KCS may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to various market risks, including interest rates, foreign currency, and fuel and commodity prices. While these financial instruments reduce the Company's exposure to changes in market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit the Company's ability to benefit from favorable changes in underlying rates or prices due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement.The availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect KCS’s operations.Changes in demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect KCS’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on KCS’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.A majority of KCS’s employees belong to labor unions. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect operations. The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 80% of KCSR and KCSM Servicios employees were covered by labor contracts subject to collective bargaining. The Company may be subject to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of disputes under these collective bargaining agreements and labor contracts or KCS’s potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United States, because such agreements are generally negotiated on an industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond KCS’s control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. If the unionized workers in the United States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown; if other employees were to become unionized or if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of United States railway  17Table of Contentsworkers to strike, there is no law in Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway workers in that country to strike.Demand for North American rail services could exceed network capacity and could result in operational inefficiencies.Over the last several years, the demand for rail services in both the United States and Mexico has increased substantially. If the demand for KCS’s rail services were to exceed the capacity of KCS’s network, KCS may experience network difficulties. Also, due to the interconnectivity between all railroads, especially in the U.S., congestion on other railroads caused by excess demand for rail services could also result in operational inefficiencies for KCS.  Traffic congestion experienced in the U.S. or Mexican railroad system may result in overall traffic congestion which would impact the ability to move traffic to and from Mexico. This system congestion and excess demand may also result in certain equipment shortages. In addition, the growth of cross border traffic in recent years has contributed to congestion on the international bridge at the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo border gateway, which is expected to continue in the near future. This could also result in operational inefficiencies for KCS and adversely affect KCS’s operations.Any such operational difficulties could also be exacerbated by factors outside of KCS’s control such as weather-related events. All of these issues could negatively affect the Company’s ability to efficiently provide rail service to our customers. KCS’s business is capital-intensive and significant expansions in the capacity of the Company’s network can take a substantial amount of time, effort, and money to accomplish. Although KCS constantly monitors its network in an effort to optimize its rail services, there can be no assurance that any measures will be able to adequately accommodate such increases in demand for rail service.KCS faces possible catastrophic loss and liability, and its insurance may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages to others.The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision, and property loss. In the course of KCS’s operations, spills or other environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business interruption due to political developments, as well as labor disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs. Collisions, environmental mishaps, or other accidents can cause serious bodily injury, death and extensive property damage, particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated areas. Additionally, KCS’s operations may be affected from time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. The Company maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice and in compliance with the requirements of the Concession against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business, property damage and business interruption due to natural disasters. However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCS’s damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, KCS is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future. Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, KCS may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to operations which could have an adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.KCS’s business may be affected by future acts of terrorism, war or other acts of violence or crime.Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s chemical transportation activities, any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements. These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise capital or its future business opportunities. KCS’s rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and damage to KCS’s property. In recent years, there have been reported incidents of train-related robberies in Mexico, including incidents involving KCSM’s trains and infrastructure. Other acts of violence or crime could also adversely affect the Company’s business.As a result, acts of terrorism or war or acts of crime or violence could result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues for KCS. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the applicable coverage currently maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be adequate to cover losses or may not be available in the future. 18Table of ContentsKCS’s ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to economic and political risks.The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly, Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSM’s operations in particular. KCS cannot predict the impact that the political landscape, including multiparty rule, will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore, KCS’s consolidated financial statements and prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting Mexico.The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. Although Mexico has imposed foreign exchange controls in the past, there are currently no exchange controls in Mexico. Pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange control policy could adversely affect KCS’s ability to obtain U.S. dollars or to convert Mexican pesos ( “pesos” or “Ps.”) into dollars for purposes of making interest and principal payments due on indebtedness, to the extent KCS may have to effect those conversions, and could adversely affect the Company’s investment in KCSM. This could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.The social and political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican economy and changes in laws, public policies and government programs could be enacted, which could have an adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.Downturns in the United States economy or in trade between the United States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates would likely have adverse effects on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. The level and timing of KCS’s Mexican business activity is heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico and the United States in these markets at any given time, and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the United States or Mexican economies or in trade between the United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on KCS’s consolidated financial statements and the Company’s ability to meet debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has invested significant amounts in developing its intermodal operations, including the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, in part to provide Asian importers with an alternative to the west coast ports of the United States, and the level of intermodal traffic depends, to an extent, on the volume of Asian shipments routed through Lazaro Cardenas. Reduction in trading volumes, which may be caused by factors beyond KCS’s control, including increased government regulations regarding the safety and quality of Asian-manufactured products, may adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates could lead to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and commodities KCSM carries.Severe weakening of the peso against the U.S. dollar may result in disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness. Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments. Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar prices for KCS’s securities. 19Table of ContentsFluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates also have an effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. A weakening of the peso against the U.S. dollar would cause reported peso-denominated revenues and expenses to decrease, and would increase reported foreign exchange loss due to the Company’s net monetary assets that are peso-denominated. Exchange rate variations also affect the calculation of taxes under Mexican income tax law, and a strengthening of the peso against the U.S. dollar would cause an increase in the Company’s cash tax obligation and effective income tax rate.Mexico may experience high levels of inflation in the future which could adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation and may experience high inflation in the future. During most of the 1980s and during the mid and late 1990s, Mexico experienced periods of high levels of inflation. The annual rates of inflation for the last three years, as measured by changes in the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by Banco de México, were 4.1% in 2014, 4.0% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2012. A substantial increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have the effect of increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could adversely affect its consolidated financial statements. High levels of inflation may also affect the balance of trade between Mexico and the United States, and other countries, which could adversely affect KCSM’s consolidated financial statements.KCS may be subject to various claims and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.The Company may be exposed to the potential of various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.Item 1B
