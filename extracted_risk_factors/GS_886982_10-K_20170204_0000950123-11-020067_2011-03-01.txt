    Form 10-K
    for more information on the regulation of our compensation
    practices.


 


    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
    This trend accelerated in recent years as the credit crisis
    caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry
    participants. Many commercial banks and other
    broad-based
    financial services firms have had the ability for some time to
    offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and
    insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking
    services, which may enhance their competitive position. They
    also have had the ability to support investment banking and
    securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other
    financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share,
    which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking
    and client execution









    businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our
    businesses.


 


    Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,
    pressure to retain market share by committing capital to
    businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may
    not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate
    clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate
    in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities)
    from financial services firms in connection with investment
    banking and other assignments.


 


    Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the
    capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors,
    and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and
    other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to
    commit capital to support our international operations and to
    execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of
    our most significant challenges and opportunities, we will have
    to compete successfully with financial institutions that are
    larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local
    presence and longer operating history outside the United States.


 


    We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
    businesses in recent years. For example, over the past several
    years the increasing volume of trades executed electronically,
    through the internet and through alternative trading systems,
    has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that
    commissions for
    “low-touch”
    electronic trading are generally lower than for
    “high-touch”
    non-electronic
    trading. It appears that this trend toward electronic and other
    “low-touch,”
    low-commission
    trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will
    continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other
    areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain
    market share by further reducing prices.


 


    The provisions of the
    U.S. Dodd-Frank
    Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)
    and other financial regulation could affect our competitive
    position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased
    fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do
    not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors.
    The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our competitive position
    will depend to a large extent on the details of the required
    rulemaking, as discussed further under “Regulation”
    below.

    Regulation


 





    As a participant in the banking, securities, futures and options
    and insurance industries, we are subject to extensive regulation
    worldwide. Regulatory bodies around the world are generally
    charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and
    other financial markets and with protecting the interests of the
    customers of market participants, including depositors in
    banking entities and the customers of
    broker-dealers.
    They are not, however, generally charged with protecting the
    interests of security holders.


 


    The financial services industry has been the subject of intense
    regulatory scrutiny in recent years. Our businesses have been
    subject to increasing regulation in the United States and other
    countries, and we expect this trend to continue in the future.
    The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010,
    significantly alters the framework within which we operate,
    including through the creation of a new systemic risk oversight
    body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC
    will oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary
    U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal
    Reserve Board, the SEC, the CFTC and the FDIC) in establishing
    regulations to address financial stability concerns. The
    Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make recommendations to the
    Federal Reserve Board as to supervisory requirements and
    prudential standards applicable to systemically important
    financial institutions, including
    risk-based
    capital, leverage, liquidity and
    risk-management
    requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements
    applicable to systemically important financial institutions be
    more stringent than those applicable to other financial
    companies. Although the criteria for treatment as a systemically
    important financial institution have not yet been determined, it
    is probable that they will apply to our firm.


 


    The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses will
    depend to a large extent on the provisions of required future
    rulemaking by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, the CFTC
    and other agencies, as well as the development of market
    practices and structures under the regime established by the
    legislation and the rules adopted pursuant to it, as discussed
    further throughout this section.














    Banking
    Regulation





    In September 2008, Group Inc. became a bank holding
    company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and
    the Federal Reserve Board became the primary regulator of
    Group Inc., as a consolidated entity. In August 2009,
    Group Inc. became a financial holding company under
    amendments to the BHC Act effected by the
    U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley
    Act of 1999 (GLB Act).


 



    Supervision and
    Regulation





    As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under
    the BHC Act, Group Inc. is subject to supervision and
    examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the system of
    “functional regulation” established under the BHC Act,
    the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary regulator of our
    consolidated organization, but generally defers to the primary
    regulators of our
    U.S. non-bank
    subsidiaries with respect to the activities of those
    subsidiaries. Such “functionally regulated”
    non-bank
    subsidiaries include
    broker-dealers
    registered with the SEC, such as our principal
    U.S. broker-dealer,
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), insurance
    companies regulated by state insurance authorities, investment
    advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their
    investment advisory activities and entities regulated by the
    CFTC with respect to certain futures-related activities.


 



    Activities





    The BHC Act generally restricts bank holding companies from
    engaging in business activities other than the business of
    banking and certain closely related activities. As a financial
    holding company, we may engage in a broader range of financial
    and related activities than are permissible for bank holding
    companies as long as we continue to meet the  eligibility
    requirements for financial holding companies, including our
    U.S. depository institution subsidiaries (consisting of
    GS Bank USA and our national bank trust company subsidiary)
    maintaining their status as “well-capitalized” and
    “well-managed” as described under
    “— Prompt Corrective Action” below. These
    activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in
    securities, insurance underwriting and making investments in
    nonfinancial companies. In addition, we are permitted under the
    GLB Act to continue to engage in certain commodities
    activities in the United States that would otherwise be
    impermissible for bank holding companies, so long as the assets
    held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of our
    consolidated assets.

Table of Contents










    Beginning in July 2011, our financial holding company
    status will also depend on Group Inc.’s maintaining
    its status as “well-capitalized” and
    “well-managed.”


 


    As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain prior
    Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or indirectly
    acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any
    unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a bank
    holding company, we may generally engage in banking and other
    financial activities abroad, including investing in and owning
    non-U.S. banks,
    if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits
    and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board.


 


    We expect to face additional limitations on our activities upon
    implementation of those provisions of the
    Dodd-Frank
    Act referred to as the “Volcker Rule,” which will
    prohibit “proprietary trading” (other than for certain
    risk-mitigation
    activities) and limit the sponsorship of, and investment in,
    hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities,
    including bank holding companies such as us. The extent of the
    additional limitations will depend on the details of agency
    rulemaking. The Volcker Rule provisions will take effect no
    later than July 2012, and companies will be required to
    come into compliance within two years after the effective date
    (subject to possible extensions).


 



    Capital and
    Liquidity Requirements





    As a bank holding company, we are subject to consolidated
    regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal
    Reserve Board. GS Bank USA is subject to broadly similar
    capital requirements, as discussed below. Under the Federal
    Reserve Board’s capital adequacy requirements and the
    regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that is
    applicable to GS Bank USA, Group Inc. and GS Bank
    USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that
    involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain
    off-balance-sheet
    items. The calculation of our capital levels and those of
    GS Bank USA, as well as GS Bank USA’s prompt
    corrective action classification, are also subject to
    qualitative judgments by regulators.


 


    Tier 1 Leverage and Basel I Capital
    Ratios.  See Note 20 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this
    Form 10-K
    for information on our Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1
    capital, total capital,
    risk-weighted
    assets and Tier 1 leverage ratio, and for a discussion of
    minimum required ratios.













    Pending Changes in Capital Requirements.  We
    are currently working to implement the requirements set out in
    the Federal Reserve Board’s Capital Adequacy Guidelines for
    Bank Holding Companies: Internal Ratings-Based and Advanced
    Measurement Approaches, which are based on the advanced
    approaches under the Revised Framework for the International
    Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued
    by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)
    as such requirements apply to us as a bank holding company
    (Basel 2). U.S. banking regulators have incorporated
    the Basel 2 framework into the existing
    risk-based
    capital requirements by requiring that internationally active
    banking organizations, such as us, transition to Basel 2
    following the successful completion of a parallel run.


 


    In addition, the Basel Committee has undertaken a program of
    substantial revisions to its capital guidelines. In particular,
    the changes in the “Basel 2.5” guidelines will
    result in increased capital requirements for market risk.
    Additionally, the Basel 3 guidelines issued by the Basel
    Committee in December 2010 revise the definition of
    Tier 1 capital, introduce Tier 1 common equity as a
    regulatory metric, set new minimum capital ratios (including a
    new “capital conservation buffer,” which must be
    composed exclusively of Tier 1 common equity and will be in
    addition to the other capital ratios), introduce a Tier 1
    leverage ratio within international guidelines for the first
    time, and make substantial revisions to the computation of
    risk-weighted
    assets for credit exposures. Implementation of the new
    requirements is expected to take place over an extended
    transition period, starting at the end of 2011 (for
    Basel 2.5) and end of 2012 (for Basel 3). Although the
    U.S. federal banking agencies have now issued proposed
    rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of the
    Basel 2.5 guidelines, they have not yet addressed all
    aspects of those guidelines or the Basel 3 changes. In
    addition, both the Basel Committee and U.S. banking
    regulators implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have indicated that
    they will impose more stringent capital standards on
    systemically important financial institutions. Therefore, the
    regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially
    different from those that have been published to date.








    9








Table of Contents










    The Dodd-Frank Act will subject Goldman Sachs at a firmwide
    level to the same leverage and
    risk-based
    capital requirements that apply to depository institutions, and
    directs banking regulators to impose additional capital
    requirements, as discussed above. The Federal Reserve Board will
    be required to begin implementing the new leverage and
    risk-based
    capital regulation by January 2012. As a consequence of
    these changes, Tier 1 capital treatment for our junior
    subordinated debt issued to trusts and our cumulative preferred
    stock will be phased out over a three-year period beginning on
    January 1, 2013. The interaction between the
    Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel Committee’s proposed changes
    adds further uncertainty to our future capital requirements. For
    example, regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank
    Act are expected to subject us to a continuing “floor”
    of the Federal Reserve Board’s regulatory requirements
    currently applicable to bank holding companies (Basel 1),
    which are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, in
    cases where Basel 2 or Basel 3 would otherwise permit lower
    capital requirements.


 


    Liquidity Ratios under Basel 3.  Historically,
    regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company
    liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in
    the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic
    measures. Basel 3 will require banks and bank holding companies
    to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests
    that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures
    historically applied by banks and regulators for management and
    supervisory purposes, will be required by regulation. One test,
    referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to
    ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of
    unencumbered
    high-quality
    liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash
    outflow for a
    30-day time
    horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow)
    under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other, referred to
    as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more
    medium- and
    long-term
    funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a
    one-year
    time horizon. These requirements may incent banking entities to
    increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and
    other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the
    use of
    long-term
    debt as a funding source. The liquidity coverage ratio would be
    implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011,
    but would not be introduced as a requirement until
    January 1, 2015, and the net stable funding ratio
    would not be introduced as a requirement until
    January 1, 2018. These new standards are subject to
    further rulemaking and their terms may change before
    implementation.














    Payment of
    Dividends





    Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders are
    subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. Under
    temporary guidance issued by the Federal Reserve Board in
    November 2010, the dividend policy of large bank holding
    companies, such as Goldman Sachs, is reviewed by the Federal
    Reserve Board based on capital plans and stress tests submitted
    by the bank holding company, and will be assessed against, among
    other things, the ability to achieve the Basel 3 capital ratio
    requirements referred to above as they are phased in by
    U.S. regulators and any potential impact of the Dodd-Frank
    Act on the company’s risk profile, business strategy,
    corporate structure or capital adequacy. The Federal
    Reserve’s current guidance provides that, for large bank
    holding companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30%
    of after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny.


 


    Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of
    dividends by our depository institution subsidiaries to
    Group Inc. In general, the amount of dividends that may be
    paid by GS Bank USA or our national bank trust company
    subsidiary is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated
    under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided
    profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend
    may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the
    entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current
    year’s net income combined with the retained net income of
    the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior
    regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a
    dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s
    “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net
    profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred
    to surplus). While GS Bank USA could have declared
    dividends of $4.63 billion to Group Inc. as of
    December 2010 in accordance with these limitations, the
    banking regulators have overriding authority to prohibit the
    payment of any dividends by GS Bank USA. In addition to the
    dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators
    have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends
    by the banking organizations they supervise if, in the banking
    regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute
    an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial
    condition of the banking organization.


 


    In addition, certain of Group Inc.’s
    non-bank
    subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory limitations on
    dividends and distributions, including our
    broker-dealer
    and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.

Table of Contents











    Source of
    Strength





    Federal Reserve Board policy historically has required bank
    holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank
    subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to
    support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this
    policy as a statutory requirement. This support may be required
    by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise
    determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding
    company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment
    to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary
    bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy,
    any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank
    regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be
    assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority
    payment.


 


    However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation
    of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the
    BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring
    payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository
    institution if the functional regulator of the payor entity
    objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve
    Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository
    institution and impose operating restrictions pending the
    divestiture.


 



    Cross-guarantee
    Provisions





    Each insured depository institution “controlled” (as
    defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be
    held liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably
    expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any
    other insured depository institution controlled by that holding
    company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of
    those depository institutions that is in danger of default. Such
    a “cross-guarantee” claim against a depository
    institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims
    of the holding company and its affiliates against that
    depository institution. At this time, we control only one
    insured depository institution for this purpose, namely
    GS Bank USA. However, if, in the future, we were to control
    other insured depository institutions, the cross-guarantee would
    apply to all such insured depository institutions.


 



    Compensation
    Practices





    Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the
    Federal Reserve Board and, with respect to some of our
    subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies
    worldwide. The scope and content of compensation regulation in
    the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect
    that these policies will evolve over a number of years.













    The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators,
    including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish joint
    regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment
    arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least
    $1 billion in total assets (which would include
    Group Inc. and some of its depositary institution,
    broker-dealer
    and investment advisor subsidiaries) that encourage
    inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee,
    director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation,
    fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss
    to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish
    regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to
    regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The
    initial version of these regulations was proposed by the FDIC in
    February 2011 and the regulations may become effective
    before the end of 2011. If the regulations are adopted in the
    form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the
    manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives.


 


    In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board and other financial
    regulators jointly issued guidance designed to ensure that
    incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations
    take into account risk and are consistent with safe and
    sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key
    principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements:
    the arrangements should provide employees incentives that
    appropriately balance risk and financial results in
    a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their
    organizations to imprudent risk; the arrangements should be
    compatible with effective controls and risk management; and the
    arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance.
    These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint
    compensation regulations under
    Dodd-Frank,
    discussed above. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has
    conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and
    practices of a number of large, complex banking organizations,
    including us. The June 2010 guidance provides that
    supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will
    be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization’s
    supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make
    acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also
    provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking
    organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or
    related risk management, control or governance processes pose a
    risk to the organization’s safety and soundness.

Table of Contents










    The Financial Stability Board, established at the direction of
    the leaders of the Group of 20, has released standards for
    implementing certain compensation principles for banks and other
    financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation
    practices. These standards are to be implemented by local
    regulators. In July 2010, the European Parliament adopted
    amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive designed to
    implement the Financial Stability Board’s compensation
    standards within the EU. Regulators in a number of countries,
    including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, have proposed
    or adopted compensation policies or regulations applicable to
    financial institutions pursuant to the Capital Requirements
    Directive. These are in addition to the proposals and guidance
    issued by U.S. financial regulators discussed above.


 



    GS Bank
    USA





    Our subsidiary, GS Bank USA, an FDIC-insured, New York
    State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System
    and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the
    New York State Banking Department and is subject to minimum
    capital requirements (described further below) that are
    calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank
    holding companies. A number of our activities are conducted
    partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its
    subsidiaries, including: origination of and market making in
    bank loans; interest rate, credit, currency and other
    derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial and residential
    mortgage origination, trading and servicing; structured finance;
    and agency lending, custody and hedge fund administration
    services. These activities are subject to regulation by the
    Federal Reserve Board, the New York State Banking Department and
    the FDIC.


 


    The Dodd-Frank Act contains “derivative push-out”
    provisions that, beginning in July 2012, will essentially
    prevent us from conducting certain
    swaps-related
    activities through GS Bank USA or another insured
    depository institution subsidiary, subject to exceptions for
    certain interest rate and currency swaps and for hedging or risk
    mitigation activities directly related to the bank’s
    business. These precluded activities may be conducted elsewhere
    within the firm, subject to certain requirements.














    Transactions with
    Affiliates





    Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and
    its subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal
    Reserve Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of
    transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from
    GS Bank USA) that may take place and generally require
    those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. These
    regulations generally do not apply to transactions between
    GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act
    significantly expands the coverage and scope of the regulations
    that limit affiliate transactions within a banking organization,
    including coverage of the credit exposure on derivative
    transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements,
    securities borrowing and lending transactions, and transactions
    with sponsored hedge funds and private equity funds.


 


    In November 2008, Group Inc. transferred assets and
    operations to GS Bank USA. In connection with this
    transfer, Group Inc. entered into a guarantee agreement
    with GS Bank USA whereby Group Inc. agreed to
    (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain transferred
    assets (other than derivatives and mortgage servicing rights) or
    reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses relating to those
    assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for
    credit-related
    losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA;
    (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain
    losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights
    transferred to GS Bank USA; and (iv) pledge collateral
    to GS Bank USA.


 


    The Dodd-Frank Act will require us to prepare and provide to
    regulators a resolution plan (a so-called “living
    will”) that must, among other things, ensure that our
    depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected
    from risks arising from our other subsidiaries. The
    establishment and maintenance of this resolution plan may, as a
    practical matter, present additional constraints on our entity
    structure and transactions among our subsidiaries.

    Deposit
    Insurance





    GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the
    benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The
    FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on
    insured depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA, and
    these assessments are currently based on the risk category of an
    institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds.
    The FDIC required all insured depository institutions to prepay
    estimated assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on
    December 30, 2009. The FDIC may increase or decrease
    the assessment rate schedule on a
    semi-annual
    basis. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended
    its regulations, effective April 1, 2011, to base insurance
    assessments on the average total consolidated assets less the
    average tangible equity of the insured depository institution
    during the assessment period.

    The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
    Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal
    banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in
    respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified
    capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories
    for FDIC-insured banks: well-capitalized, adequately
    capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
    and critically undercapitalized.


 


    A depository institution is generally deemed to be
    “well-capitalized,”
    the highest category, if it has a Tier 1 capital ratio of
    at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a
    Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. In connection with
    the November 2008 asset transfer described under
    “Transactions with Affiliates” below, GS Bank USA
    agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to maintain minimum
    capital ratios in excess of these “well-capitalized”
    levels.


 


    See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8 of this
    Form 10-K
    for information on the calculation of GS Bank USA’s
    capital ratios under Basel 1 and for a discussion of
    minimum required ratios.


 


    GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance with
    the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to
    state member banks, which are based on Basel 1 as implemented by
    the Federal Reserve Board. An institution may be downgraded to,
    or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is
    indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an
    unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory
    examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA
    imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
    operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital
    category of an institution









    declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also
    subject a depository institution to capital raising
    requirements. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized
    institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or
    conservator.


 


    The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to
    depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such
    as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is
    authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company
    level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding
    company’s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain
    instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution
    subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to
    guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized
    subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable
    for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments
    on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy
    of the holding company, the guarantee would take priority over
    the holding company’s general unsecured creditors.


 



    Insolvency of an
    Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding
    Company





    If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an
    insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon
    its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the
    power:


 




    
    



        •  

        to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and
    liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the
    depository institution’s creditors;




 



        •  

        to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s
    contracts pursuant to their terms; or




 



        •  

        to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the
    depository institution is a party, the performance of which is
    determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or
    repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the
    orderly administration of the depository institution.





 


    In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit
    liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses
    against an insured depository institution would be afforded a
    priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
    institution, including claims of debt holders of the
    institution, in the “liquidation or other resolution”
    of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or
    not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of
    GS Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently
    from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than,
    the depositors of the depository institution.

    The Dodd-Frank Act creates a resolution regime for systemically
    important
    non-bank
    financial companies, including bank holding companies and their
    affiliates, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to
    liquidate the entity. This resolution authority was based on the
    FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, with certain
    modifications to reflect differences between depository
    institutions and
    non-bank
    financial companies and to reduce disparities between the
    treatment of creditors’ claims under the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an orderly liquidation
    authority proceeding compared to those that would exist under
    the resolution model for depository institutions.


 



    Trust Companies





    Group Inc.’s two limited purpose trust company
    subsidiaries are not permitted to and do not accept deposits or
    make loans (other than as incidental to their trust
    activities) and, as a result, are not insured by the FDIC. The
    Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A., a national banking
    association that is limited to fiduciary activities, is
    regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
    and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The Goldman
    Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose
    trust company, is regulated by the Office of the Delaware State
    Bank Commissioner.


 



    U.S. Securities
    and Commodities Regulation





    Goldman Sachs’
    broker-dealer
    subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects
    of the securities business, including sales methods, trade
    practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and
    securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of
    clients’ purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers
    and employees. In the United States, the SEC is the federal
    agency responsible for the administration of the federal
    securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a
    broker-dealer,
    a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and
    as a
    broker-dealer
    in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
    Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt
    rules that apply to, and examine,
    broker-dealers
    such as GS&Co.


 


    In addition, state securities and other regulators also have
    regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly,
    our businesses are also subject to regulation by various
    non-U.S. governmental
    and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in
    virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs
    Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and one of its
    subsidiaries are registered
    U.S. broker-dealers
    and are









    regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs
    Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC
    derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives
    activities.


 


    The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the
    United States is subject to regulation under the
    U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal
    agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of
    Goldman Sachs’ subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and
    GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission
    merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading
    advisors and are subject to CEA regulations. The rules and
    regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as
    the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
    other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association,
    also govern the commodity futures and commodity options
    activities of these entities.


 


    For a discussion of net capital requirements applicable to
    GS&Co. and GSEC, see Note 20 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our exchange-based
    market-making
    activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of
    securities exchanges. As a DMM on the NYSE and as a market maker
    on other exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets
    in the securities to which we are assigned. Under the
    NYSE’s DMM rules, this may require us to supply liquidity
    to these markets in certain circumstances.


 


    J. Aron & Company is authorized by the
    U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell
    wholesale physical power at
    market-based
    rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron &
    Company is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal
    Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As
    a result of our investing activities, GS&Co. is also an
    “exempt holding company” under the U.S. Public
    Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.


 


    In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities
    activities, we are subject to extensive and evolving energy,
    environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as
    discussed under “Risk
    Factors — Our
    commodities activities, particularly our power generation
    interests and our physical commodities activities, subject us to
    extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and
    environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us
    to significant liabilities and costs” in Part I,
    Item 1A of this
    Form 10-K.

    The Dodd-Frank Act will result in additional regulation of our
    broker-dealer
    and regulated subsidiaries in a number of respects. The
    legislation calls for the imposition of expanded standards of
    care by market participants in dealing with clients and
    customers, including by providing the SEC with authority to
    adopt rules establishing fiduciary duties for
    broker-dealers
    and directing the SEC to examine and improve sales practices and
    disclosure by
    broker-dealers
    and investment advisers. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains
    provisions designed to increase transparency in
    over-the-counter
    derivatives markets by requiring the registration of all swap
    dealers and
    security-based
    swap dealers, and the clearing and execution of
    “swaps” through regulated facilities (subject to
    limited exceptions, including swaps with
    non-financial
    end users and swaps that are not cleared by a clearing agency).
    Furthermore, federal banking agencies are required under the
    Dodd-Frank Act to develop rules whereby anyone who organizes or
    initiates an
    asset-backed
    security transaction must retain a portion (generally, at least
    five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a
    third party.


 



    Other Regulation
    in the United States





    Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
    insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they
    are domiciled and in the other states in which they are
    licensed, and Group Inc. is subject to oversight as an
    insurance holding company in states where our insurance
    subsidiaries are domiciled. State insurance regulations limit
    the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to
    Group Inc. in certain circumstances, and could require
    regulatory approval for any change in “control” of
    Group Inc., which may include control of 10% or more of our
    voting stock. In addition, a number of our other activities,
    including our lending and mortgage activities, require us to
    obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject
    to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we
    conduct these activities.


 


    The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA
    PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains
    anti-money
    laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the
    implementation of various regulations applicable to all
    financial institutions, including standards for verifying client
    identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor
    client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through
    these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to
    promote the identification of parties that may be involved in
    terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.
    Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain
    some similar









    provisions. The obligation of financial institutions, including
    Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and
    report suspicious transactions, to respond to requests for
    information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement
    agencies, and to share information with other financial
    institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of
    internal practices, procedures and controls that have increased,
    and may continue to increase, our costs, and any failure with
    respect to our programs in this area could subject us to
    substantial liability and regulatory fines.


 



    Regulation Outside
    the United States





    Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the
    United Kingdom under the regulation of the FSA. Goldman Sachs
    International (GSI), our regulated U.K.
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements imposed by the FSA. Other
    subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB),
    our regulated U.K. bank, are also regulated by the FSA. As of
    December 2010, GSI and GSIB were in compliance with the FSA
    capital requirements.


 


    Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe), our
    regulated Irish bank, is subject to minimum capital requirements
    imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland. As of
    December 2010, this bank was in compliance with all
    regulatory capital requirements. Group Inc. has issued a
    general guarantee of the obligations of this bank.


 


    Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the
    banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the
    European countries in which they operate, including, among
    others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and
    the Bundesbank in Germany, the Autorité de Contrôle
    Prudentiel and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers in
    France, Banca d’Italia and the Commissione Nazionale per le
    Società e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial
    Markets Service and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation
    in Russia and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.
    Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the
    European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of
    which they are members.

    The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA
    and other regulators within the European Union (EU) are
    regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which
    implement EU directives requiring, among other things,
    compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer
    protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting
    rules. These standards, requirements and rules are generally
    implemented in a similar manner, under the same directives,
    throughout the EU.


 


    The EU has adopted risk retention requirements applicable to
    asset-backed
    security offerings similar to those required under the
    Dodd-Frank Act, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements
    applicable to such offerings.


 


    Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japan’s
    Financial Services Agency. As of December 2010, GSJCL was
    in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements. GSJCL is
    also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities
    Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities
    Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the
    Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.


 


    Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong
    Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities
    Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service,
    the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board
    of India, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and
    also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to
    the rules of the SEC.


 


    Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and
    regulatory authorities in countries in which Goldman Sachs
    operates, including, among others, Brazil and Dubai. In
    addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by
    the FSA and certain are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary
    Authority.














    Regulations
    Applicable in and Outside the United States





    The U.S. and
    non-U.S. government
    agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,
    as well as state securities commissions and other state
    regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct
    administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the
    issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or
    expulsion of a
    broker-dealer
    or its directors, officers or employees. From time to time, our
    subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and
    proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of
    various regulations relating to our activities.


 


    The SEC and FINRA have rules governing research analysts,
    including rules imposing restrictions on the interaction between
    equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at
    member securities firms. Various
    non-U.S. jurisdictions
    have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements
    with respect to research and may impose additional regulations.


 


    Our investment management business is subject to significant
    regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating
    to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and
    our management of client funds.


 


    As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold
    capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency
    requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning
    the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based
    upon its underlying risk.


 


    Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with
    regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,
    the EU or other jurisdictions
    and/or
    enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges
    relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees
    or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations
    could expose us to liability
    and/or
    reputational damage.

    Cautionary
    Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995


 


    We have included or incorporated by reference in this
    Form 10-K,
    and from time to time our management may make, statements that
    may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only
    our









    beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature,
    are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These
    statements include statements other than historical information
    or statements of current condition and may relate to our future
    plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may
    also include our belief regarding the effect of changes to the
    capital and leverage rules applicable to bank holding companies,
    the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses and
    operations, and various legal proceedings as set forth under
    “Legal Proceedings” in Note 30 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of this
    Form 10-K,
    as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of
    our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about
    trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements
    about our future status, activities or reporting under
    U.S. or
    non-U.S. banking
    and financial regulation, and statements about our investment
    banking transaction backlog.


 


    By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are
    alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and
    financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the
    anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
    forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause
    our actual results and financial condition to differ from those
    indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among
    others, those discussed below and under “Risk Factors”
    in Part I, Item 1A of this
    Form 10-K.


 


    In the case of statements about our investment banking
    transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk
    that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that
    they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,
    if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may
    differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
    Important factors that could result in a modification of the
    terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed
    include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or
    continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of
    hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or
    an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
    securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,
    a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain
    adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a
    party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required
    regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors
    that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions,
    see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of
    this
    Form 10-K.

    Item 1A.  

    
    Risk
    Factors





 





    We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in
    our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,
    operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The
    following are some of the more important factors that could
    affect our businesses.


 


    Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely
    affected by conditions in the global financial markets and
    economic conditions generally.


 


    Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable
    earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by
    conditions in the global financial markets and economic
    conditions generally. In the past several years, these
    conditions have changed suddenly and, for a period of time, very
    negatively. In 2008 and through early 2009, the financial
    services industry and the securities markets generally were
    materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the
    values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of
    liquidity.


 


    Since 2008, governments, regulators and central banks in the
    United States and worldwide have taken numerous steps to
    increase liquidity and to restore investor and public
    confidence. In addition, there are numerous legislative and
    regulatory actions that have been taken to deal with what
    regulators, politicians and others believe to be the root
    causes of the financial crisis, including laws and regulations
    relating to financial institution capital requirements and
    compensation practices, restrictions on the type of activities
    in which financial institutions are permitted to engage, and
    generally increased regulatory scrutiny. In some cases,
    additional taxes have been (or have been proposed to be) imposed
    on certain financial institutions. Many of the regulations that
    are required to implement recently adopted legislation
    (including the Dodd-Frank Act) are still being drafted or are
    not yet in effect; therefore, the exact impact that these
    regulations will have on our businesses, results of operations
    and cash flows is presently unclear.













    Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions
    has been greatly reduced and many companies were, and some
    continue to be, in serious difficulty due to reduced consumer
    spending and low levels of liquidity in the credit markets.
    National and local governments are facing difficult financial
    conditions due to significant reductions in tax revenues,
    particularly from corporate and personal income taxes, as well
    as increased outlays for unemployment benefits due to high
    unemployment levels and the cost of stimulus programs.


 


    Declines in asset values, the lack of liquidity, reduced
    volatility, general uncertainty about economic and market
    activities and a lack of consumer, investor and CEO confidence
    have negatively impacted many of our businesses.


 


    Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment
    in which our businesses operate. A favorable business
    environment is generally characterized by, among other factors,
    high global gross domestic product growth, transparent, liquid
    and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and
    investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions, and strong
    business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market
    conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth,
    business activity or investor or business confidence;
    limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of
    credit and capital; increases in inflation, interest rates,
    exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic
    commodities; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical
    instability; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce
    investor confidence in capital markets; natural disasters or
    pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.


 


    The business environment continued to improve during 2010,
    although there were several periods of market disruption, but
    there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue in
    the near or long term. If they do not, our results of operations
    may be adversely affected.

    Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by
    declining asset values. This is particularly true for those
    businesses in which we have net “long” positions,
    receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or
    post collateral.


 


    Many of our businesses have net “long” positions in
    debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities
    (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset
    classes. These include positions we take when we act as a
    principal to facilitate our clients’ activities, including
    our exchange-based
    market-making
    activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain
    positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as
    through our currencies, commodities and equities activities.
    Because nearly all of these investing, lending and market-making
    positions are marked-to-market on a daily basis, declines in
    asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings,
    unless we have effectively “hedged” our exposures to
    such declines. In certain circumstances (particularly in the
    case of leveraged loans and private equities or other securities
    that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid
    trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge
    such exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be
    ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from
    increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and
    significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially
    curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets,
    which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such
    assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets
    reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the
    difficulty in valuing assets may require us to maintain
    additional capital and increase our funding costs.


 


    In our exchange-based
    market-making
    activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain
    an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining
    market. In markets where asset values are declining and in
    volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need
    for liquidity.


 


    We receive
    asset-based
    management fees based on the value of our clients’
    portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some
    cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the
    value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the
    value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in
    turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.













    We post collateral to support our obligations and receive
    collateral to support the obligations of our clients and
    counterparties in connection with our client execution
    businesses. When the value of the assets posted as collateral
    declines, the party posting the collateral may need to provide
    additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading
    position. A classic example of such a situation is a
    “margin call” in connection with a brokerage account.
    Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as
    collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is
    increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the
    party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and
    reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving
    collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing
    the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.
    In addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the
    difficulty of valuing assets which can lead to costly and
    time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of
    required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the
    recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate
    collateral.


 


    Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by
    disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to
    credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.


 


    Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the
    availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our
    ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so
    in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by
    issuing
    long-term
    debt, promissory notes and commercial paper, by accepting
    deposits at our bank subsidiaries or by obtaining bank loans or
    lines of credit. We seek to finance many of our assets on a
    secured basis, including by entering into repurchase agreements.
    Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and
    more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our
    available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our
    operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to
    curtail our business activities and increase our cost of
    funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,
    particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending
    and market making.

    Our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on
    access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance
    their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased
    cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing
    of     our     clients’
    merger and     acquisition
    transactions — particularly
    large transactions — and adversely affect our
    financial advisory and underwriting businesses.


 


    In addition, we may incur significant unrealized gains or losses
    due solely to changes in our credit spreads or those of third
    parties, as these changes may affect the fair value of our
    derivative instruments and the debt securities that we hold or
    issue.


 


    Our
    market-making
    activities have been and may be affected by changes in the
    levels of market volatility.


 


    Certain of our
    market-making
    activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and
    arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in
    volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect
    the results of these activities. On the other hand, increased
    volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,
    also increases risk as measured by
    Value-at-Risk
    (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with
    our
    market-making
    activities or cause us to reduce our
    market-making
    positions in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the
    size of our
    market-making
    positions can adversely affect our profitability, even though
    spreads are widening and we may earn more on each trade. In
    periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are
    declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets
    at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts.
    In such circumstances we may be forced to either take on
    additional risk or to incur losses in order to decrease our VaR.
    In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our
    risk weighted assets and increase our capital requirements, both
    of which in turn increase our funding costs.













    Our investment banking, client execution and investment
    management businesses have been adversely affected and may
    continue to be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack
    of confidence among investors and CEOs due to general declines
    in economic activity and other unfavorable economic,
    geopolitical or market conditions.


 


    Our investment banking business has been and may continue
    to be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic
    conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can
    adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO
    confidence, resulting in significant
    industry-wide
    declines in the size and number of underwritings and of
    financial advisory transactions, which could have an adverse
    effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular,
    because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues
    is derived from our participation in large transactions, a
    decline in the number of large transactions would adversely
    affect our investment banking business.


 


    In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines
    in market or economic activity may affect our client execution
    businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by
    decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and
    even declining economic activity may result in higher trading
    volumes or higher spreads or both.


 


    Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions,
    as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to
    transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or
    their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues,
    principally in our investment management business. To the extent
    that clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them
    in products that generate less fee income.

    Our investment management business may be affected by the
    poor investment performance of our investment products.


 


    Poor investment returns in our investment management business,
    due to either general market conditions or underperformance
    (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or
    accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or
    sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to
    attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.
    This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn
    on assets under management or the commissions that we earn for
    selling other investment products, such as structured notes or
    derivatives.


 


    We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk
    management processes and strategies.


 


    We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk
    and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but
    complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and
    legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review
    processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process
    seeks to balance our ability to profit from
    market-making,
    investing or lending positions with our exposure to potential
    losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk
    monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and
    the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate
    every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing
    of such outcomes. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities,
    incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved
    unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations
    inherent in using historical data to manage risk.


 


    The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures
    reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack
    thereof among prices of various asset classes or other
    market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen
    circumstances, such as occurred during 2008 and early 2009,
    previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or
    conversely previously correlated indicators may move in
    different directions. These types of market movements have at
    times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and
    have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so
    in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated
    where other market participants are using risk or trading models
    with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In
    these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk
    positions due to the activity of other market participants or
    widespread market









    dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are
    declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.


 


    To the extent that we have positions through our
    market-making
    or origination activities or we make investments directly
    through our investing activities in securities, including
    private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading
    market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or
    hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and
    therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In
    addition, we invest our own capital in private equity, debt,
    real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on
    our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these
    funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may
    make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures
    relating to these investments.


 


    For a further discussion of our risk management policies and
    procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be
    adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital
    markets or to sell assets or by a reduction in our credit
    ratings or by an increase in our credit spreads.


 


    Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity may be
    impaired by an inability to access secured
    and/or
    unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our
    subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our
    investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This
    situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable
    to control, such as a general market disruption or an
    operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by
    the perception among market participants that we, or other
    market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.


 


    The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to
    which we are a party are complex, as we employ structured
    products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex
    structured products often do not have readily available markets
    to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and
    lending activities may lead to situations where the holdings
    from these activities represent a significant portion of
    specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our
    positions.








    21








Table of Contents










    Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other
    market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the
    same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market
    crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we
    interact may exercise
    set-off
    rights or the right to require additional collateral, including
    in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our
    access to liquidity.


 


    Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction
    in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
    competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our
    access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under
    certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized
    financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties
    could be permitted to terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or
    require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our
    trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to
    sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to
    find other sources of financing or to make significant cash
    payments or securities movements. Certain rating agencies have
    indicated that the
    Dodd-Frank
    Act could result in the rating agencies reducing their assumed
    level of government support and therefore result in ratings
    downgrades for certain large financial institutions, including
    Goldman Sachs.


 


    Our cost of obtaining
    long-term
    unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the
    amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury
    securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same
    maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases
    in our credit spreads can significantly increase our
    cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are
    continuous,
    market-driven,
    and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile
    movements. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions
    of our creditworthiness. In addition, our credit spreads
    may be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers
    of credit default swaps referenced to our
    long-term
    debt. The market for credit default swaps, although very
    large, has proven to be extremely volatile and currently lacks a
    high degree of structure or transparency.













    Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to
    appropriately identify and address conflicts of interest could
    adversely affect our businesses.


 


    As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client
    base, we increasingly must address potential conflicts of
    interest, including situations where our services to a
    particular client or our own investments or other interests
    conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of
    another client, as well as situations where one or more of our
    businesses have access to material
    non-public
    information that may not be shared with other businesses within
    the firm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity
    with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.


 


    In addition, our status as a bank holding company subjects us to
    heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the
    Federal Reserve Board with respect to transactions between
    GS Bank USA and entities that are or could be viewed as
    affiliates of ours.


 


    We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to
    identify and address conflicts of interest, including those
    designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among
    our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing
    with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our
    reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be
    damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into
    transactions with us may be affected if we fail, or appear to
    fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with
    conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived
    conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory
    enforcement actions.

    Group Inc. is a holding company and is dependent for
    liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are
    subject to restrictions.


 


    Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on
    dividends, distributions and other payments from its
    subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments
    on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our
    subsidiaries, including our
    broker-dealer,
    bank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws that
    restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to
    block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
    Group Inc. In addition, our
    broker-dealer,
    bank and insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on
    their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum
    regulatory capital requirements, as well as restrictions on
    their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or
    bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions
    on related-party transactions, increased capital requirements
    and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in
    bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can
    reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of
    Group Inc. and even require Group Inc. to provide
    additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or
    regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that
    Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations,
    including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition,
    Group Inc.’s right to participate in a distribution of
    assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is
    subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.


 


    Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment
    obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including
    GS&Co., GS Bank USA, GS Bank Europe and Goldman
    Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. subject to certain
    exceptions, and has pledged significant assets to GS Bank
    USA to support obligations to GS Bank USA. In addition,
    Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other
    consolidated subsidiaries on a
    transaction-by-transaction
    basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may
    require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets
    to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a
    time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its
    own obligations. See “Business — Regulation”
    in Part I, Item 1 of this
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of regulatory restrictions.













    Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be
    adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or
    defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other
    assets or whose securities or obligations we hold.


 


    We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,
    securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.
    These parties may default on their obligations to us due to
    bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
    reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even
    concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to
    significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other
    institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.


 


    We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third
    parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In
    addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties
    whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses
    and/or
    adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use
    those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A
    significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our
    counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.
    While in many cases we are permitted to require additional
    collateral from counterparties that experience financial
    difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we
    are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The
    termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may
    subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.
    Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to
    the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of
    market stress and illiquidity.


 


    As part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we
    finance our clients’ positions, and we could be held
    responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients.
    Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific
    clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries
    and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default
    risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult
    to detect or foresee.

    Concentration of risk increases the potential for
    significant losses in our
    market-making,
    underwriting, investing and lending activities.


 


    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses in our
    market-making,
    underwriting, investing and lending activities. The number and
    size of such transactions may affect our results of operations
    in a given period. Moreover, because of concentration of risk,
    we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions
    are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the
    credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit
    exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend
    large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.
    The Dodd-Frank Act will require issuers of
    asset-backed
    securities and any person who organizes and initiates an
    asset-backed
    securities transaction to retain economic exposure to the asset,
    which could significantly increase the cost to us of engaging in
    securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit
    risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions,
    including during periods of market stress, could negatively
    affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair
    value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or
    bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues
    associated with selling such securities or loans.


 


    In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a
    concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,
    borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, and a failure
    or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively
    impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by
    which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure
    to individual entities, industries and countries may not
    function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us
    to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely
    execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties
    engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and
    dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and
    investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit
    concentration with respect to these counterparties. Provisions
    of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to lead to increased
    centralization of trading activity through particular clearing
    houses, central agents or exchanges, which may increase our
    concentration of risk with respect to these entities.













    The financial services industry is highly
    competitive.


 


    The financial services industry and all of our businesses are
    intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We
    compete on the basis of a number of factors, including
    transaction execution, our products and services, innovation,
    reputation, creditworthiness and price. Over time, there has
    been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies
    in the financial services industry. This trend accelerated over
    recent years as a result of numerous mergers and asset
    acquisitions among industry participants. This trend has also
    hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial
    services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to
    support our international operations and to execute large global
    transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas
    and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more
    experience and more established relationships with clients,
    regulators and industry participants in the relevant market,
    which could adversely affect our ability to expand. Governments
    and regulators have recently adopted regulations, imposed taxes
    or otherwise put forward various proposals that have or may
    impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a
    cost-effective
    manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including
    proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in
    which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or
    other similar proposals, which may not apply to all our
    U.S. or
    non-U.S. competitors,
    could impact our ability to compete effectively.


 


    Pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have
    continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of
    our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing
    prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and
    other assignments, we have experienced pressure to extend and
    price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us
    for the risks we take.

    We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us
    to transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties
    and expose us to new asset classes and new markets.


 


    A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and
    expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,
    directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are
    not within our traditional client and counterparty base and
    expose us to new asset classes and new markets. For example, we
    are increasingly transacting business and investing in new
    regions, including a wider range of emerging and growth markets.
    Furthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we
    make markets, invest and lend, we directly or indirectly own
    interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership
    and operation of public services, such as airports, toll roads
    and shipping ports, as well as power generation facilities,
    physical commodities and other commodities infrastructure
    components, both within and outside the United States. Recent
    market conditions may lead to an increase in opportunities to
    acquire distressed assets and we may determine opportunistically
    to increase our exposure to these types of assets.


 


    These activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including
    risks associated with dealing with governmental entities,
    reputational concerns arising from dealing with less
    sophisticated counterparties and investors, greater regulatory
    scrutiny of these activities, increased
    credit-related,
    sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or
    acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in
    which these assets are being operated or held.













    Derivative transactions and delayed settlements may expose
    us to unexpected risk and potential losses.


 


    We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,
    including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative
    instruments are individually negotiated and
    non-standardized,
    which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions
    difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to
    the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other
    obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we
    do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation
    and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or
    other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments
    due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays
    with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as
    increased costs to the firm. Derivative transactions may also
    involve the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for
    a counterparty, that documentation has not been properly
    executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable
    against the counterparty.


 


    Derivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary
    bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties
    are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a
    timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or
    during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened
    credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may
    find it more difficult to enforce our rights. In addition, as
    new and more complex derivative products are created, covering a
    wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes
    about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which
    could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk
    exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs.
    The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing
    of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market
    shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk
    associated with such transactions, but under certain
    circumstances could also limit our ability to develop
    derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and
    ourselves and adversely affect our profitability and increase
    our credit exposure to such platform.

    Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable
    to hire and retain qualified employees.


 


    Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability
    to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our
    businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and
    geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented
    and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing
    employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain
    such employees include our compensation and benefits, and our
    reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly
    hiring, training and promoting qualified employees.


 


    Competition from within the financial services industry and from
    businesses outside the financial services industry for qualified
    employees has often been intense. This is particularly the case
    in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for
    qualified employees with entities that have a significantly
    greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.


 


    As described further in “Business —
    Regulation — Banking Regulation” and
    “Regulation — Compensation Practices” in
    Part I, Item 1 of this
    Form 10-K,
    our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the
    standards of, the Federal Reserve Board. As a large financial
    and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on
    compensation practices (which may or may not affect our
    competitors) by the Federal Reserve Board, the FSA, the FDIC or
    other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any
    imposed by or as a result of future legislation or regulation,
    may require us to alter our compensation practices in ways that
    could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
    talented employees. We may also be required to make additional
    disclosure with respect to the compensation of employees,
    including
    non-executive
    officers, in a manner that directly or indirectly results in the
    identity of such employees and their compensation being made
    public. Any such additional public disclosure of employee
    compensation may also make it difficult to attract and retain
    talented employees.













    Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to
    extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.


 


    As a participant in the financial services industry and a bank
    holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation in
    jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant
    intervention by regulatory and taxing authorities in all
    jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. Among other
    things, as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and
    regulations, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some
    of our business activities, subject to limitations or conditions
    on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially
    higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with
    the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees.


 


    There is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes
    in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our
    businesses or those of our clients, including tax burdens and
    compensation restrictions, could be imposed on a limited subset
    of financial institutions (either based on size, activities,
    geography or other criteria), which may adversely affect our
    ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are
    not affected in the same way.


 


    The impact of such developments could impact our profitability
    in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us
    to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such
    jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs
    associated with changing our business practices, restructuring
    our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our
    employees to other locations or complying with applicable
    capital requirements, including liquidating assets or raising
    capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs
    or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.


 


    For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our
    businesses are subject, see “Business —
    Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this
    Form 10-K.

    We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and
    regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.


 


    Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and
    law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to
    compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other
    matters has increased dramatically in the past several years.
    The financial crisis and the current political and public
    sentiment regarding financial institutions has resulted in a
    significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as
    adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government
    officials. Press coverage and other public statements that
    assert some form of wrongdoing often result in some type of
    investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement
    officials or in lawsuits. Responding to these investigations and
    lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding,
    is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and
    effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and
    fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased
    substantially over the last several years, and certain
    regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence
    enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation
    targeted at the financial services industry. Adverse publicity,
    governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can
    also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale
    and performance of our employees, which could adversely
    affect our businesses and results of operations.


 


    A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or
    those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our
    businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential
    information, damage our reputation and cause losses.


 


    Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process
    and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of
    transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous
    and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as
    well as the information technology services we provide to
    clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as
    well as legal and regulatory standards.


 


    As our client base and our geographical reach expands,
    developing and maintaining our operational systems and
    infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging. Our financial,
    accounting, data processing or other operating systems and
    facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a
    result of events









    that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike
    in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to
    process these transactions or provide these services. We must
    continuously update these systems to support our operations and
    growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets.
    This updating entails significant costs and creates risks
    associated with implementing new systems and integrating them
    with existing ones.


 


    In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure,
    termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing
    agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial
    intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions,
    and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we
    increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect
    to our clients’ systems.


 


    In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among
    clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing
    number of derivative transactions are now or in the near future
    will be cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure
    to operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of
    the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could
    affect our ability to find adequate and
    cost-effective
    alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or
    constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market
    participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of
    operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be
    integrated, often on an accelerated basis.


 


    Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial
    institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses,
    and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the
    risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity
    may cause an
    industry-wide
    operational failure that could materially impact our ability to
    conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint
    could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions,
    service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our
    businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our
    clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our
    businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.

    Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,
    our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
    disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses
    and the communities in which we are located. This may include a
    disruption involving electrical, communications, internet,
    transportation or other services used by us or third parties
    with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a
    result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or
    those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a
    broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those
    buildings or systems are located.


 


    Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including
    the New York metropolitan area, London, Bangalore, Hong Kong,
    Tokyo and Salt Lake City, work in close proximity to one
    another, in one or more buildings. Notwithstanding our efforts
    to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and
    the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York
    metropolitan area, depending on the intensity and longevity of
    the event, a catastrophic event impacting our New York
    metropolitan area offices could very negatively affect our
    business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our
    employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or
    communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to
    service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not
    be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend
    on communication or travel.


 


    Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
    transmission of confidential and other information in our
    computer systems and networks. Although we take protective
    measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,
    our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to
    unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious
    code and other events that could have a security impact. If one
    or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize
    our or our clients’ or counterparties’
    confidential and other information processed and stored in, and
    transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or
    otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our
    clients’, our counterparties’ or third parties’
    operations, which could result in significant losses
    or reputational damage. We may be required to expend
    significant additional resources to modify our protective
    measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or
    other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and
    financial losses that are either not insured against or not
    fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.













    We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and
    proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We
    have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service
    providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop
    secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be
    unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our
    clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other
    third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third
    parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the
    confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or
    mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information
    being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service
    provider, counterparty or other third party could result in
    legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.


 


    Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory
    action against us could have material adverse financial effects
    or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could
    seriously harm our business prospects.


 


    We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the
    volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial
    institutions remain high. See “Legal Proceedings”
    in Part I, Item 3 of this
    Form 10-K
    for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are
    involved. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers
    and clients increase in a market downturn and that
    employment-related claims increase in periods when we have
    reduced the total number of employees.


 


    There have been a number of highly publicized cases, involving
    actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the
    financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk
    that employee misconduct could occur. This misconduct has
    included and may include in the future the theft of proprietary
    software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee
    misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect
    this activity have not been and may not be effective in all
    cases.

    The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of
    new trading technology may adversely affect our business and may
    increase competition.


 


    Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The
    growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new
    technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with
    new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are
    increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems
    and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears
    that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue
    and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading
    systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based
    market-making
    activities, and we may experience continued competitive
    pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased
    use by our clients of
    low-cost
    electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to
    trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and
    spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade
    directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of
    their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. We
    have invested significant resources into the development of
    electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but
    there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these
    systems will yield an adequate return on our investment,
    particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from
    electronic trades.


 


    Our commodities activities, particularly our power
    generation interests and our physical commodities activities,
    subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic
    events and environmental, reputational and other risks that may
    expose us to significant liabilities and costs.


 


    We engage in, or invest in entities that engage in, the
    production, storage, transportation, marketing and trading of
    numerous commodities, including crude oil, oil products, natural
    gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and
    precious), minerals (including uranium), emission credits, coal,
    freight, liquefied natural gas and related products and indices.
    These activities subject us to extensive and evolving federal,
    state and local energy, environmental and other governmental
    laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and
    regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water
    quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous
    substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and
    safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns may lead to
    additional regulation that could increase the operating costs
    and profitability of our investments.













    We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or
    future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related
    activities and investments, particularly electric power
    generation, transportation and storage of physical commodities
    and wholesale sales and trading of electricity and natural gas.
    Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to
    commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring,
    installation of pollution control equipment, renovation of
    storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission
    fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding
    of, permits and licenses.


 


    Our commodities-related activities are also subject to the risk
    of unforeseen or catastrophic events, many of which are outside
    of our control, including breakdown or failure of power
    generation equipment, transmission lines, transport vessels,
    storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other
    mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of
    hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of
    output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or
    other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on
    third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their
    contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including
    the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to
    safely transport or store commodities, could adversely affect
    our activities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain
    insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we
    have may be inadequate to cover our losses.


 


    The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from
    performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our
    operations or financial results and may result in litigation,
    regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.

    In conducting our businesses around the world, we are
    subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other
    risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.


 


    In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to risks of possible
    nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital
    controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
    actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of
    terrorism. In many countries, the laws and regulations
    applicable to the securities and financial services industries
    and many of the transactions in which we are involved are
    uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to
    determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market.
    Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in
    compliance with the application of local laws in a particular
    market or our failure to develop effective working relationships
    with local regulators could have a significant and negative
    effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our
    reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk
    that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable
    in all cases.


 


    Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into
    new regions throughout the world, including emerging and growth
    markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging
    and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and
    financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of
    their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign
    debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or
    negative growth rates in their economies, as well as military
    activity or acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of
    these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and
    increased volatility in financial markets generally.













    While business and other practices throughout the world differ,
    our principal legal entities are subject in their operations
    worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and
    illegal payments and money laundering, as well as laws relating
    to doing business with certain individuals, groups and
    countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
    the USA PATRIOT Act and U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested
    and continue to invest significant resources in training and in
    compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our
    operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the
    vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly
    increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such
    rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to
    significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation.


 


    We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or
    catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic,
    terrorist attacks or natural disasters.


 


    The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including
    the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency
    (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),
    terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic
    and financial disruptions, could lead to operational
    difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair
    our ability to manage our businesses, and could expose our
    insurance activities to significant losses.
