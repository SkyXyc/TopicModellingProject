. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company—Regulatory Risks."In the area of transmission infrastructure, SCE may experience increased competition from merchant transmission providers. The FERC has made changes to its transmission planning requirements with the goal of opening transmission development to competition from independent developers. In July 2011, the FERC adopted new rules that remove incumbent public utility transmission owners' federally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities. The rules direct regional entities, such as ISOs, to create new processes that would allow other providers to develop certain types of new transmission projects. The CAISO filed its processes, as required by the rule, with the FERC in October 2012. The FERC has not yet approved these processes. The majority of SCE's 2013 – 2014 transmission capital forecast relates to transmission projects that have been approved by the CAISO and barring a re-evaluation under the new rules, will not be subject to the new processes. SCE does not expect these projects to be re-evaluated. The impact of the new rules on future transmission projects will depend on the processes ultimately implemented by regional entities.PropertiesSCE supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks. Its transmission facilities, which include sub-transmission facilities and are located primarily in California but also in Nevada and Arizona, deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of lines ranging from 33 kV to 500 kV and substations. SCE's distribution system, which takes power from substations to customers, includes over 59,000 circuit miles of overhead 8lines, 44,000 circuit miles of underground lines and over 700 distribution substations, all of which are located in California. SCE owns the generating facilities listed in the following table.Generating Facility Location(in CA, unlessotherwise noted) Fuel Type Operator SCE'sOwnershipInterest (%)Net PhysicalCapacity(in MW) SCE's Capacitypro rata share(in MW)San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station South of San Clemente Nuclear SCE 78.21%2,150  1,760 Hydroelectric Plants (36) Various Hydroelectric SCE 100%1,176  1,176 Pebbly Beach Generating Station Catalina Island Diesel SCE 100%9  9 Mountainview Redlands Natural Gas SCE 100%1,050  1,050 Peaker Plants (5) Various Gas fueled Combustion Turbine SCE 100%245  245 Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Phoenix, AZ Nuclear APS 15.8%3,739  591 Four Corners Units 4 and 5 Farmington, NM Coal-fired APS 48%1,540  739 Solar PV Plants (24) Various Photovoltaic SCE 100%63  63 Total        9,972  5,633 In November 2010, SCE entered into an agreement to sell its interest in Four Corners to APS for approximately $294 million. The sale remains contingent upon APS obtaining a satisfactory long-term coal supply agreement for the plant. As of January 2013, the sale agreement may be terminated by either party. As of the date of this report, the agreement has not been terminated by either party. The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments under the sale agreement, which includes, among other adjustments, a reduction in the purchase price of $7.5 million for each month between October 1, 2012 and the closing date. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for more information.San Onofre, Four Corners, certain of SCE's substations, and portions of its transmission, distribution and communication systems are located on lands owned by the federal, state or local governments under licenses, permits, easements or leases, or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises. Certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate SCE, under specified circumstances and at its expense, to relocate such transmission, distribution, and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal, state, or local governments.Thirty-one of SCE's 36 hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs are located in whole or in part on U.S.-owned lands and are subject to FERC licenses. Twenty of these plants have 29- to 40-year FERC licenses that expire at various times between 2021 and 2046. Eight plants are currently being relicensed and are operating under temporary annual permits with new FERC licenses expected within one to two years and three plants are not operating and undergoing decommissioning. FERC licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on SCE, including the right of the United States to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation. When existing licenses expire, the FERC has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications, but only if their license application is superior to SCE's and then only upon payment of specified compensation to SCE. New licenses issued to SCE are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the FERC to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process. Substantially all of SCE's properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements."SeasonalityDue to warm weather during the summer months and SCE's rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than the other quarters.ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION OF EDISON INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIESLegislative and regulatory activities by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States relating to energy and the environment impose numerous restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities by Edison International's subsidiaries, as well as the cost of mitigating the 9environmental impacts of past operations. The environmental regulations and other developments discussed below have the largest impact on SCE's fossil-fuel fired power plants, and therefore the discussion in this section focuses mainly on regulations applicable to the states of California and New Mexico, where SCE's facilities are located.Edison International and SCE continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments and to evaluate possible strategies for compliance with environmental regulations. Additional information about environmental matters affecting Edison International and its subsidiaries, including projected environmental capital expenditures, is included in the MD&A under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources—SCE—Capital Investment Plan" and in "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Environmental Remediation" and "—Note 10. Environmental Developments."Air QualityThe CAA, which regulates air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources, has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel plants, especially coal-fired plants. The CAA requires the US EPA to establish concentration levels in the ambient air for six criteria pollutants to protect public health and welfare. These concentration levels are known as NAAQS. The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2.Federal environmental regulations of these criteria pollutants require states to adopt state implementation plans, known as SIPs, for certain pollutants, which detail how the state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation. The SIPs must be equal to or more stringent than the federal requirements and must be submitted to the US EPA for approval. Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas), and must develop a SIP both to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas. If the attainment status of areas changes, states may be required to develop new SIPs that address the changes. Much of southern California is in a non-attainment area for several criteria pollutants.National Ambient Air Quality StandardsOzoneIn January 2010, the US EPA proposed a revision to the primary and secondary NAAQS for 8-hour ozone that it had finalized in 2008. The 8-hour ozone standard established in 2008 was 0.075 parts per million but the implementation process must be completed before the 0.075 parts-per-million standard can be enforced. The US EPA issued initial area designations of attainment, nonattainment, and unclassifiable areas across the nation in 2012. Areas in SCE's service territory were classified in various degrees of nonattainment, including Los Angeles (known as the South Coast Air Basin), which was designated as extreme nonattainment; Kern County (marginal nonattainment); Riverside County (severe nonattainment); Ventura County (serious nonattainment); and the San Joaquin Valley (extreme nonattainment). States will then be required to develop and submit state implementation plans outlining how compliance with the 2008 NAAQS will be achieved. Particulate MatterIn December 2012, the US EPA lowered the primary annual NAAQS for fine particulate matter (known as PM2.5) from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). The EPA retained the existing 24-hour NAAQS for PM2.5 (35 mg/m3) and for coarse particulate matter (known as PM10) (150 mg/m3). These new limits take effect in 2020. States must recommend attainment designations to EPA by December 2013, with final designations expected in 2015 and implementation plans due in 2018. Regional HazeThe regional haze rules under the CAA are designed to prevent impairment of visibility in certain federally designated areas. The goal of the rules is to restore visibility in mandatory federal Class I areas, such as national parks and wilderness areas, to natural background conditions by 2064. Sources such as power plants that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in Class I areas may be required to install best available retrofit technology ("BART") or implement other control strategies to meet regional haze control requirements.In relation to Four Corners, the US EPA issued its final FIP in August 2012. The FIP requires the installation of SCR pollution control equipment within designated time periods, or alternatively the shutdown of Units 1-3 and installation of SCRs on Units 4 and 5 within other designated times periods. In November 2010, SCE and APS entered into an agreement for the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5 to APS, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions. Due to the investment constraints of SB 1368, the California law on GHG emission performance standards discussed below in  "—Greenhouse Gas Regulation—Regional Initiatives and State Legislation," SCE does not intend to be a Four Corners participant after the 2016 expiration of the current participant agreements and does not expect to participate in any investment 10in Four Corners SCRs. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for more information on the pending sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners.New Source Review RequirementsThe NSR regulations impose certain requirements on facilities, such as electric generating stations, if modifications are made to air emissions sources at the facility. Since 1999, the US EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's coal-fired power plants.In April 2009, APS, as operating agent of Four Corners, received a US EPA request pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA for information about Four Corners, including information about Four Corners' capital projects from 1990 to the present. SCE understands that in other cases the US EPA has utilized responses to similar Section 114 letters to examine whether power plants have triggered NSR requirements under the CAA. In October 2011, four environmental organizations filed a lawsuit against the Four Corners owners alleging NSR violations. In January 2012, the organizations amended their complaint, also alleging related New Source Performance Standards violations, and served it on the Four Corners owners. The proceeding is currently stayed, to allow for settlement discussions until March 2013. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for information on the pending sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners and "—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Four Corners New Source Review Litigation" for more information on the lawsuit.Water QualityClean Water ActRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for many of SCE's construction projects, and govern critical parameters at generating facilities, such as the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design, and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. In March 2011, the US EPA proposed standards under the federal Clean Water Act that would affect cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. The standards are intended to protect aquatic organisms by reducing capture in screens attached to cooling water intake structures (impingement) and in the water volume brought into the facilities (entrainment). These standards are expected to be finalized by June 2013. SCE is evaluating the proposed standards and believes, from a preliminary review, that compliance with the proposed standards regarding impingement will be achievable without incurring material additional capital expenditures or operating costs. The required measures to comply with the proposed standards regarding entrainment are subject to the discretion of the permitting authority, and SCE is unable at this time to assess potential costs of compliance, which could be significant for San Onofre.California-Prohibition on the Use of Ocean-Based Once-Through CoolingCalifornia has a US EPA-approved program to issue individual or group permits for the regulation of Clean Water Act discharges. California also regulates certain discharges not regulated by the US EPA. Effective October 1, 2010, the California State Water Resources Control Board issued a final policy, which establishes closed-cycle wet cooling as required technology for retrofitting existing once-through cooled plants like SCE's San Onofre and many of the existing natural gas power plants along the California coast. The final policy required an independent engineering study to be completed prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 regarding the feasibility of compliance by California's two coastal nuclear power plants. The policy may result in significant capital expenditures at San Onofre and may affect its operations.Coal Combustion ResidualsUS EPA regulations currently classify coal ash and other coal combustion residuals as solid wastes that are exempt from hazardous waste requirements. This classification enables beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals, such as for cement production and fill materials. In June 2010, the US EPA published proposed regulations relating to coal combustion residuals that could result in their reclassification. Two different proposed approaches are under consideration, and SCE understands that US EPA issuance of a final rule is not expected before late 2013.The first approach, under which the US EPA would list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation as hazardous wastes, could require the owners of Four Corners to incur additional capital and operating costs. The second approach, under which the US EPA would regulate these residuals as nonhazardous wastes, would establish minimum technical standards for units that are used for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, but would allow procedural and enforcement mechanisms (such as permit requirements) to be exclusively a matter of state law.11Greenhouse Gas RegulationThere have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Any climate change regulation or other legal obligation that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions or that would impose additional costs or charges for the emission of GHGs could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels, and especially from coal-fired plants, as well as the cost of purchased power.Federal Legislative/Regulatory DevelopmentsIn June 2010, the US EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, known as the "GHG tailoring rule." This regulation generally subjects newly constructed sources of GHG emissions and newly modified existing major sources to the PSD air permitting program beginning in January 2011 (and later, to the Title V permitting program under the CAA); however the GHG tailoring rule significantly increases the emissions thresholds that apply before facilities are subjected to these programs. The emissions thresholds for CO2 equivalents in the final rule vary from 75,000 tons per year to 100,000 tons per year depending on the date and whether the sources are new or modified. In March 2012, the US EPA announced proposed carbon dioxide emission limits for new power plants. Regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the PSD program could affect efforts to modify SCE's facilities in the future, and could subject new capital projects to additional permitting or emissions control requirements that could delay such projects. In December 2010, the US EPA announced that it had entered into a settlement with various states and environmental groups to resolve a long-standing dispute over regulation of GHGs from electrical generating units pursuant to the New Source Performance Standards in the CAA and would propose performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants and emissions guidelines for existing power plants. The specific requirements will not be known until the regulations are finalized. Since January 2010, the US EPA's Final Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule has required all sources within specified categories, including electric generation facilities, to monitor emissions, and to submit annual reports to the US EPA by March 31 of each year. SCE's 2012 GHG emissions from utility-owned generation were approximately 6.9 million metric tons.Regional Initiatives and State LegislationRegional initiatives and state legislation may also require reductions of GHG emissions and it is not yet clear whether or to what extent any federal legislation would preempt them. If state and/or regional initiatives remain in effect after federal legislation is enacted, utilities and generators could be required to satisfy them in addition to the federal standards.SCE's operations in California are subject to two laws governing GHG emissions. The first law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (also referred to as AB 32), establishes a comprehensive program to reduce GHG emissions. AB 32 required the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") to develop regulations, which became effective in 2012, that would reduce California's GHG emissions to 1990 levels in yearly increments by 2020. In December 2011, the CARB regulation was officially published establishing a California cap-and-trade program. The first compliance period for the cap-and-trade program is for 2013 GHG emissions. The first auction, held on November 14, 2012 cleared at $10.09/metric ton, nine cents above the floor price. CARB regulations implementing a cap-and-trade program and the cap-and-trade program itself, continue to be the subject of litigation. In March 2012, environmental groups filed a case against CARB challenging the cap-and-trade program's offset provisions. SCE intervened as part of a broad business coalition to support the offset provisions. In November 2012, the California Chamber of Commerce filed a suit alleging that the auction itself violated AB 32 and the California Constitution. Both suits are pending. The second law, SB 1368, required the CPUC and the CEC to adopt GHG emission performance standards restricting the ability of California investor-owned and publicly owned utilities, respectively, to enter into long-term arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The standards that have been adopted prohibit these entities, including SCE, from entering into long-term financial commitments with generators that emit more than 1,100 pounds of CO2 per MWh, the performance of a combined-cycle gas turbine generator. SB 1368 may prohibit SCE from making emission control expenditures at Four Corners. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for information on the sale of SCE's interest in Four Corners.In April 2011, California enacted a law to require California retail sellers of electricity to procure 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute. On December 1, 2011, the CPUC approved a decision setting procurement quantity requirements for CPUC-regulated retail sellers that incrementally increase to 33% over several periods between January 2011 and December 31, 2020. The quantity would remain at 33% of retail sales for each 12year thereafter. SCE's delivery of eligible renewable resources to customers was 21% of its total energy portfolio for 2011 and its delivery of eligible renewable resources to customers is estimated to be approximately 20% of its total energy portfolio for 2012.Litigation DevelopmentsLitigation alleging that GHG is a public and private nuisance may affect SCE, whether or not it is named as a defendant. The law is unsettled on whether or not this litigation presents questions capable of judicial resolution or political questions that should be resolved by the legislative or executive branches. For further discussion see "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments."ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONALEdison International's liquidity depends on SCE's ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to Edison International.Edison International is a holding company and, as such, it has no operations of its own. Edison International's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of SCE and its ability to make upstream distributions. Prior to paying dividends to Edison International, SCE has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. In addition, CPUC holding company rules require that SCE's dividend policy be established by SCE's Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE's service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. SCE may also owe tax-allocation payments to Edison International under applicable tax-allocation agreements. Financial market and economic conditions may have an adverse effect on Edison International's liquidity. See "Risks Relating to Southern California Edison" below for further discussion.The Bankruptcy Court may not approve the Settlement Transaction, or even if the Settlement Transaction is approved, it may not be consummated if certain conditions are not met. If the Settlement Transaction is not approved and consummated, Edison International may not be entitled to receive certain benefits contemplated by the Support Agreement.On the Petition Date, EME and its wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.Under the Support Agreement to which EME, Edison International and certain of EME's senior unsecured noteholders are parties, each of them has agreed to support Bankruptcy Court approval of the Settlement Transaction, subject to conditions. If the Settlement Transaction is approved and consummated, EME will be required to perform its obligations under its tax allocation and intercompany services agreements with Edison International, to indemnify Edison International against liabilities arising from EME's conduct of its separate business, and Edison International, EME and the EME noteholders who have signed the Support Agreement will exchange releases of claims in accordance with the terms of the Support Agreement.Under the Support Agreement, within 150 days following the Petition Date, EME will seek authority from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into the Settlement Transaction. The parties to the Support Agreement will seek approval by the Bankruptcy Court within 210 days following the Petition Date of the Settlement Transaction, which includes the benefits to Edison International described above. If the Bankruptcy Court does not grant approval within that period, the Support Agreement is subject to termination. There can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will approve the Settlement Transaction, and even if it is approved, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the effectiveness of the Settlement Transaction will be satisfied. In addition, EME is entitled to terminate the Support Agreement and consider alternative transactions in accordance with its fiduciary duties. If the Settlement Transaction is not approved, absent a separate agreement, Edison International will not receive the benefits described above.Edison International's future performance may be affected by southern California events.While Edison International intends to continue to conduct both regulated and competitive businesses in the future, the bankruptcy of EME has resulted in its current business being concentrated almost entirely in the regulated sector and in southern California. As a result, Edison International's future performance may be affected by events concentrated in southern California and it does not have diversification of sources of revenue or regulatory oversight.13RISKS RELATING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANYRegulatory RisksSCE's financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates.SCE's ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover from its customers in a timely manner its costs, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and FERC. SCE's financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. SCE's capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power, increasing environmental regulations, moderating demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. Increases in self-generation also reduce the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered, while costs potentially could increase due to system modifications that may be necessary to cope with the systemic effects of self-generation. Customers that self-generate their own power do not currently pay most transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations. The net result is to increase utility rates further for those customers who do not self-generate, which encourages more self-generation and further rate increases. If SCE is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover material amounts of its costs (including an adequate return on capital) in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. For further information on SCE's rate requests, see "Management Overview—2012 General Rate Case" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources—SCE—FERC Formula Rates" in the MD&A.SCE's energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity.SCE obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants, and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. California law and CPUC decisions allow SCE to recover through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. Nonetheless, SCE's cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes to commodity prices. In addition, SCE is subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely CPUC decisions about the compliance with SCE's procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs.SCE may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect SCE's liquidity and results of operations, see "Market Risk Exposures" in the MD&A.SCE is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory decisions and changes in applicable regulations or legislation.SCE operates in a highly regulated environment. SCE's business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. Among other things, the CPUC regulates SCE's retail rates and capital structure, and the FERC regulates SCE's wholesale rates. The NRC regulates the safety of SCE's nuclear power plants. The construction, planning, and project site identification of SCE's power plants and transmission lines in California are also subject to the jurisdiction of the California Energy Commission (for thermal power plants 50 MW or greater) and the CPUC.SCE must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders. Should SCE be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on SCE, SCE's business could be materially affected. The process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by concerted community opposition and such delay or defeat would have a material effect on SCE's business.This extensive governmental regulation creates significant risks and uncertainties for SCE's business. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to SCE, or its facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE's business or result in significant additional costs. In addition, regulation adopted via the public initiative process may apply to SCE, or its facilities or operations in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE's business or result in significant additional costs.14Competitive RisksSCE faces increased competition as a result of technological advancements.The electricity industry is undergoing transformative change. Technological advancements such as energy storage and distributed generation may change the nature of energy generation and delivery. These changes may materially affect SCE's business model as a regulated utility and its ability to compete with new energy generation and delivery business models.Operating RisksSCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its facilities.SCE's infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. In order to mitigate this risk, SCE is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment programs. This substantial investment program elevates the operational risks and the need for superior execution in its activities. SCE's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous. SCE's inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs, system limitations and degradation, and interruptions in necessary supplies.Weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations.Weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including storms, wildfires and earthquakes, can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to SCE's customers. These events can lead to lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repair costs. They can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if SCE encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers. These occurrences could materially affect SCE's business, financial condition and results of operations, and the inability to restore power to SCE's customers could also materially damage the business reputation of SCE and Edison International.The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to employees and the general public.Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment. Injuries and property damage caused by such contact can subject SCE to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In the wake of recent natural disasters such as windstorms, which can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages, the CPUC has increased its focus on public safety issues with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. Such penalties and liabilities could be significant but are very difficult to predict. The range of possible penalties and liabilities includes amounts that could materially affect SCE's liquidity and results of operations.SCE's systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.Regulators, such as the NERC, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, have noted that the U.S. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures have potential vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and disruptions and that such cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. SCE's operations require the continuous operation of critical information technology systems and network infrastructure. Although SCE actively monitors developments in this area and is involved in various industry groups and government initiatives, no security measures can completely shield such systems and infrastructure from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. If SCE's information technology systems security measures were to be breached or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, SCE could be unable to fulfill critical business functions and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations. See "Item 1. Business—Regulation—NERC" for further discussion.There are inherent risks associated with operating nuclear power generating facilities, including, among other things, the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear power generating facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials.15The scope of necessary repairs for the steam generators in Unit 2 and Unit 3 of San Onofre or the length of the Units' outages could prove more extensive than is currently estimated. The cost of such repairs or the substitute market power that must be purchased during the outage could exceed estimates and insurance coverage or may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise.Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre have been off-line for extensive inspections, testing and analysis of their steam generators after unexpected wear and a leak were discovered in them in early 2012. SCE, the manufacturer of the steam generators and a team of outside experts have worked together to analyze the causes of the wear and possible remedial actions. The CPUC has begun an investigation proceeding that will consider the cost recovery for all of San Onofre costs, including the cost of the steam generator replacement project, substitute market power costs, operation and maintenance costs and the seismic study costs. SCE cannot assure that the scope of necessary repairs or the length of the outages will not exceed current estimates. There can also be no assurance that the cost of such repairs or the necessary substitute market power will not exceed current estimates and insurance coverage or that they will be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise. These amounts could be material and could materially affect SCE's financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see "Management Overview—San Onofre Outage, Inspection and Repair Issues" in the MD&A.Continued NRC scrutiny of San Onofre may result in additional corrective actions that will increase operations and maintenance costs or require additional capital expenditures.San Onofre is subject to extensive oversight and scrutiny of the NRC. This scrutiny may result in SCE being required to take additional corrective actions and incur increased operations and maintenance expenses or new capital expenditures. If SCE is unable to take effective corrective actions required by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect SCE fully against losses from a nuclear incident.Federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection which is currently approximately $12.6 billion. SCE and other owners of the San Onofre and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $375 million per site. If nuclear incident liability claims were to exceed $375 million, the remaining amount would be made up from contributions of approximately $12.2 billion made by all of the nuclear facility owners in the U.S., up to an aggregate total of $12.6 billion. There is no assurance that the CPUC would allow SCE to recover the required contribution made in the case of one or more nuclear incident claims that exceeded $375 million. If this public liability limit of $12.6 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. There can be no assurance of SCE's ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Nuclear Insurance."Spent fuel storage capacity could be insufficient to permit long-term operation of SCE's nuclear plants.The U.S. Department of Energy has defaulted on its obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear industry participants by January 31, 1998. If SCE or the operator of Palo Verde were unable to arrange and maintain sufficient capacity for interim spent-fuel storage now or in the future, it could hinder the operation of the plants and impair the value of SCE's ownership interests until storage could be obtained, each of which may have a material effect on SCE.SCE's insurance coverage for wildfires arising from its ordinary operations may not be sufficient and Edison International may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance on SCE's behalf for such occurrences.Edison International has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from SCE's ordinary operations. In addition, the insurance Edison International has obtained on SCE's behalf for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect Edison International's and SCE's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to Edison International.Environmental RisksSCE is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may involve significant and increasing costs and materially affect SCE.SCE is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations and permitting requirements that involve significant and increasing costs and substantial uncertainty. SCE devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation projects, and emission allowances to comply with existing and anticipated 16environmental regulatory requirements. However, the current trend is toward more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement greenhouse gas controls could materially affect operations of power plants, which could in turn impact electricity markets and SCE's purchased power costs. SCE may also be exposed to risks arising from past, current or future contamination at its former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in its operations. Other environmental laws, particularly with respect to air emissions, disposal of ash, wastewater discharge and cooling water systems, are also generally becoming more stringent. The continued operation of SCE facilities may require substantial capital expenditures for environmental controls or cessation of operations. Current and future state laws and regulations in California also could increase the required amount of energy that must be procured from renewable resources. See "Item 1. Business—Environmental Regulation of Edison International and Subsidiaries" and "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments" for further discussion of environmental regulations under which SCE operates.Financing RisksAs a capital intensive company, SCE relies on access to the capital markets. If SCE were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations would be materially affected.SCE regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. SCE's needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. SCE's ability to arrange financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including SCE's levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, its financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. SCE's failure to obtain additional capital from time to time would have a material effect on SCE's liquidity and operations.ITEM 1B
