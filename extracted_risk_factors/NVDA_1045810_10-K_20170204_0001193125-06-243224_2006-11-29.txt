STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">This Form 10-K/A should be read in conjunction with our periodic filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, subsequent to
the date of the Original Filing, including any amendments to those filings, such as the amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended April 30, 2006, as well as any Current Reports filed on Form 8-K subsequent to the
date of the Original Filing. In addition, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, this Form 10-K/A includes updated certifications from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.   The SEC may disagree
with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors, and there is a risk that its inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate
our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, the SEC may issue guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past option grant
measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or prior filings with the SEC to provide additional disclosures pursuant to this guidance. Any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent SEC reports
and delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
