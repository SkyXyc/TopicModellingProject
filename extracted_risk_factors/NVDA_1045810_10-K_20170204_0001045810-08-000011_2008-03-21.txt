      GPU Business
    
      Our GPU Business is
comprised primarily of our GeForce products that support desktop and notebook
PCs, plus memory products. Our GPU Business is focused on Microsoft Windows and
Apple PC platforms.  GeForce GPUs power PCs made by or distributed by
virtually every PC OEM worldwide in desktop PCs, notebook PCs, PCs loaded with
Windows Media Center and media extenders such as the Apple
TV.  GPUs enhance the user experience for playing video games, editing
photos, viewing and editing videos and high-definition, or HD, movies. GPUs also
enable the rich visual user interfaces of the Windows Vista and Apple OS X
operating systems. The combination of the programmable Unified Shader GPU with
Microsoft Corporation’s, or Microsoft’s, DirectX 10 high-level shading language
is known as DirectX 10 GPUs. Combined with the ability to directly access the
GPU via the new Windows Vista applications from Microsoft Office to Web 2.0,
applications can now incorporate improved quality through 3D
effects.
    
      We believe we are in an era
where visual computing is becoming increasingly important to consumers and other
end users of our products. Our strategy is to promote our GeForce brand as
one of the most important processors through technology leadership, increasing
programmability, and great content experience.  In fiscal year 2008,
our strategy was to extend our architectural and technology advantage with our
second-generation DirectX 10 GPUs, the GeForce 8-series GPUs. During fiscal year
2008, we added the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra, GeForce 8800 GT, GeForce 8600,
GeForce 8500, and GeForce 8300 to our GeForce 8-series of GPUs, which previously
included the GeForce 8800 GTX and 8800 GTS products. Our standalone desktop GPU
category share grew from 52% to 64% in fiscal year 2008, according to the
Mercury Research 2006 and 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Reports,
respectively.
     
       During fiscal year 2008, we
launched a new family of GeForce 8M Series notebook GPUs.   The
GeForceM and NVIDIA Quadro FX mobile families represent our notebook GPUs and
include the GeForce 8M, GeForce 7 Go, and NVIDIA Quadro FX M GPUs. These GPUs
are designed to deliver desktop graphics performance and features for multiple
notebook configurations such as desktop replacement notebooks, multimedia
notebooks, thin-and-light notebooks and notebook workstations. The GeForce M and
GeForce Go products are designed to serve the needs of both enterprise and
consumer users. The NVIDIA Quadro FX M products are designed to serve the needs
of workstation professionals in the area of product design and digital content
creation.  We experienced a high degree of design-win success for the
Intel Santa Rosa platform cycle during fiscal year 2008, which helped our
standalone notebook category share grow from 58% to 75%, according to the
Mercury Research 2006 and 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Reports,
respectively.
    
      Professional Solutions
Business
    
      Our PSB is comprised of
our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and other professional
graphics products, including our NVIDIA Tesla high-performance computing
products. Our NVIDIA Quadro brand products are designed to deliver the highest
possible level of performance and compatibility for the professional
industry.  The NVIDIA Quadro family consists of the NVIDIA Quadro Plex
Visual Computing System, or VCS, NVIDIA Quadro FX, and the NVIDIA Quadro Night
Vision Systems, or NVS, professional workstation processors. NVIDIA Quadro
products are recognized by many as the standard for professional graphics
solutions needed to solve many of the world’s complex visual computing
challenges in the manufacturing, entertainment, medical, science, and aerospace
industries. NVIDIA Quadro products are fully certified by several software
developers for professional workstation applications and are designed to deliver
the graphics performance and precision required by professional
applications.
    
      We believe that recent years
have experienced an increasing level of global adoption for the computer-aided
design approach of product creation.  NVIDIA has the leading position
in the professional graphics category with over 70% share by revenue according
to the 2007 Fourth Quarter International Data Corporation, or IDC, Market
Research Report.  We achieved this market position by providing
innovative GPU technology, software, and tools that integrate the capabilities
of our GPU with a broad array of visualization products.  During
fiscal year 2008, we launched seven new Quadro solutions, including the Quadro
FX 370 and 570. We also introduced a new line of notebook workstation GPUs - the
NVIDIA Quadro FX 1600M, 570M and 360M – as well as a new line of desktop
workstation GPUs – the NVIDIA Quadro FX 4600 and 5600 – all based on our GeForce
8-series unified shader architecture.  We expanded our NVIDIA Quadro
Plex family with the introduction of the NVIDIA Quadro Plex VCS IV, a new
version of the NVIDIA Quadro Plex Visual Computing System, or VCS, which
provides enhanced performance for a wide range of high-performance,
graphics-intensive styling and design, oil and gas, and scientific

      In fiscal year 2008, we
also introduced NVIDIA Tesla, our entry into the high-performance computing
industry. Tesla is a new family of GPU computing products that delivers
processing capabilities for high-performance computing applications. The Tesla
family consists of the C870 GPU Computing processor, the D870 Deskside
Supercomputer and the S870 1U Computing Server. During the third quarter of
fiscal year 2008, we began shipments of our Tesla C870 GPU computing processor
and D870 desk-side supercomputer products. Compute Unified Device Architecture,
or CUDA, software has been acknowledged for its ability to transform a GPU into
a supercomputer and to deliver the level of performance normally found in large
and expensive clusters residing in datacenters to the desktop of scientists and
engineers around the world. During fiscal year 2008, NVIDA made available the
first public version of the NVIDIA CUDA Software Developer Kit and C-compiler
for computing on NVIDIA GPUs.
     
      In fiscal year 2008, we
completed our acquisition of Mental Images, an industry leader in photorealistic
rendering technology. Mental Images’ Mental Ray product is considered by many to
be the most pervasive ray tracing renderer in the industry.  Mental
Images visualization technology is embedded in most major digital content
creation, or DCC, and computer aided design, or CAD, applications, and their
rendering technology is deployed by major manufacturers and film studios. We
believe that this strategic combination will enable the development of tools and
technologies that will advance the state of visualization, will be optimized for
next generation computing architectures, and will create new product categories
for both hardware and software.
    
            MCP Business
     
       Our MCP Business is comprised of
NVIDIA nForce core logic and NVIDIA GeForce mGPU products.  Our NVIDIA
nForce and GeForce mGPU families of products address the multi-billion dollar
computer core logic market.  Core logic is the computer’s “central
nervous system,” controlling and directing high speed data between the central
processing unit, or CPU, the GPU, storage, and networks.  High
quality, long-term reliability, and top performance are key customer demands of
core logic suppliers. Our strategy for MCPs aligns with what we anticipate will
drive growth in the MCP segment such as multi-core, ever-increasing-speed
networking and storage technologies, and integration of complex features such as
virtualization, security processing and network processing.  During
the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we shipped our first single-chip mGPUs
for Intel-processor-based desktop PCs.  We believe that the GeForce
7000 mGPU family delivers the performance of an entry-level discrete GPU when
compared against traditional integrated graphics solutions. We also shipped the
GeForce 7050 mGPU, which targets the lower cost categories of the market. We are
now the only chipset supplier to support processor platforms created by both
Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, and the
only branded integrated GPU supplier for the Intel processor
platform.  We believe that the integrated graphics opportunity
represents approximately 60% of the world PC market. We also extended the
reach of Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, technology into the performance
category with the launch of our NVIDIA nForce 650i SLI, 680i LT SLI and 680i
Ultra MCP products for Intel. We are now the second largest core logic supplier
in the world with 15% segment share of the total core logic market, according to
the Mercury Research 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Chipsets and Processors
report.
    
      In fiscal year 2008, we
announced a new technology named Hybrid SLI.  We named it hybrid
because this technology combines a powerful as well as an energy-efficient
engine and SLI because it is our multi-GPU technology.  When GeForce
add-in graphics cards are connected to GeForce mGPUs, Hybrid SLI kicks in,
combining their processing power to deliver an improved
experience.  The technology is application aware so, depending on the
processing demands of each application running on the host PC, the discrete GPU
may be completely shut-down in order to save power.  For example, a PC
containing the combined power of dual GeForce 8800 GTX SLI add-in graphics cards
can reach 400 watts. If such a PC contained Hybrid SLI technology, both GPUs
could be powered down when the user is doing email, surfing the web, or watching
a Blu-ray movie, keeping the system quiet and consuming lower levels of
energy.  But when a video game or any other demanding GPU application
is launched, the dual GeForce 8800 GTX’s would be powered up to deliver the
performance required to power the related application.  Hybrid SLI was
made available starting with our GeForce8-series mGPUs.
    
      Our MCP strategy is to
bring the benefits of GeForce GPUs to the most price sensitive categories while
creating exciting platform architectures like SLI, Hybrid SLI, and
Enthusiast System Architecture, or ESA.  ESA is a standard for system
information protocol that links a PC system’s various critical components – such
as fan, power supply, smart chassis, GPUs, and motherboards.  It
enables a unified architecture for applications and users to control and
optimize the performance of their system.  SLI, Hybrid SLI, and ESA
are examples of how NVIDIA creates architectures that advance the capabilities
of the PC.

      Consumer Products
Business
    
      Our CPB is comprised of
our GoForce and APX mobile brands and products that support PMPs, PDAs, cellular
phones and other handheld devices. This business also includes license, royalty,
other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other
digital consumer electronics devices.
     
        We believe
that mobile devices like phones, music players, and portable navigation
devices will increasingly become multi-function, multi-tasking,
PCs.  As such, we anticipate the architecture of these devices will
increasingly become more consumer PC-like and be capable of delivering all the
entertainment and web experiences that end users currently enjoy on a PC, but in
a form-factor that fits nicely in their hands.  Our mobile strategy is
to create an application processor and a computer-on-a-chip that enables this
experience. NVIDIA GoForce mobile products and application processors
implement design techniques, both inside the chips and at the system level,
which result in high performance and long battery life. These technologies
enhance visual display capabilities, improve connectivity, and minimize chip and
system-level power consumption. NVIDIA GoForce products can be found primarily
in multimedia cellular phones and other handheld devices. In February 2008, we
launched the NVIDIA APX 2500, our first such application
processor.  The APX 2500 is a computer-on-a-chip designed to meet the
growing multimedia demands of today's mobile phone user.  The APX 2500
is the culmination of several hundred man years of research and
development.  We believe that the mobile application processor is an
area where we can add a significant amount of value and we also believe that it
represents growth opportunity that could ultimately reach the level of several
hundred million units a year. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008,
we shipped the GoForce 6100, which was the first product resulting from our
acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc., or PortalPlayer, in fiscal year
2007.  The GoForce 6100 can be found in primarily in
PMPs.
    
    Our

high-bandwidth digital media to develop products designed to address the
requirements of high-bandwidth concurrent multimedia.
    
      Use our Intellectual Property and
Resources to Enter into License and Development Contracts. From time to
time, we expect to enter into license arrangements that will require significant
customization of our intellectual property components.  For license
arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property
components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services are
performed. For example, in fiscal year 2006, we entered into an agreement with
Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc., or SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU for
SCE’s PlayStation3.  Our collaboration with SCE includes license fees and
royalties for the PlayStation3 and all derivatives, including next-generation
digital consumer electronics devices.  In addition, we are licensing
software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics
capabilities to SCE. 
    
    Sales
and Marketing
    
      Our worldwide sales and
marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier
of performance GPUs, MCPs, and applications processors that support PMPs, PDAs,
cellular phones and other handheld devices. Our sales and marketing teams work
closely with each industry’s respective OEMs, ODMs, system builders, motherboard
manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and industry trendsetters,
collectively referred to as our Channel, to define product features,
performance, price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a
high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support
the competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled
team of application engineers to assist the Channel in designing, testing and
qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the
depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving the Channel’s
time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the
Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next
generation of our products.
    
      In the GPU and MCP
segments we serve, the sales process involves achieving key design wins with
leading OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into
high volume production with key ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board
manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder
channel that is serviced by add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our
distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract
equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board
manufacturers and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad
range of major OEMs and/or strong brand name recognition in the retail channel.
In the CPB segment we serve, the sales process primarily involves achieving key
design wins directly with the leading handheld OEMs and supporting the product
design into high-volume production. Currently, we sell a significant portion of
our processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers
and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our
products to leading OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system
builders.
    
      Although a small number
of our customers represent the majority of our revenue, their end customers
include a large number of OEMs and system builders throughout the
world.  As a result of our Channel strategy, our sales are focused on
a small number of customers. Sales to our largest customer, Asustek Computer,
Inc. accounted for 10% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2008.
    
      To encourage software
title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms
utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships
in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel
interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our
products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical
problems. Our developer program makes certain of our products available to
developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of
software titles that are optimized for our products.
    
    Backlog
    
      Our sales are primarily
made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by
our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that
reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing
availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time
orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and
experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is
non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
portion is not significant. We do not believe that a backlog as of any
particular date is indicative of future results.

    Seasonality
    
      Our industry is largely
focused on the consumer products market. Due to the seasonality in this market,
we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of
the calendar year related to the back-to-school and holiday
seasons.
    
    Manufacturing
    
      We do not directly
manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what
is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our product-line
operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the
manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and
packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that
are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, in
such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability
and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the
significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing
operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the
raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus
our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and
customer support.
     
      We utilize
industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corporation, or TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered, Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corporation, or SMIC, and Austria Micro Systems, or AMS to produce
our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as
Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, Amkor Technology, or Amkor, JSI
Logistics Ltd., or JSI, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd, or KYEC, Siliconware
Precision Industries Company Ltd., or SPIL, and STATS ChipPAC Incorporated, or
ChipPAC, to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our
products.
    
      We typically receive
semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality
assurance and then ship the semiconductors to CEMs, distributors, motherboard
and add-in board manufacturer customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong
Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our
design kit and test specifications, and then ship the products to retailers,
system builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.
    
    Inventory
and Working Capital
    
            Our management focuses
considerable attention on managing our inventories and other
working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our
customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a
product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products
that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased
by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that
reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing
availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products
because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders
and quick delivery schedules.
    
    Research
and Development
        
       We believe that the
continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading
3D graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power communications, storage, and
secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success.
Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing
multiple generations of GPUs, MCPs and our consumer products that support PMPs,
PDAs, cellular phones or other handheld devices using independent design teams.
Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups
consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale
integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and
algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient
simultaneous development of multiple generations of products.
     
       A critical component of our
product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer
aided design, or CAD, industry. We invest significant resources in the
development of relationships with industry leaders, including Cadence Design
Systems, Inc., and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the
product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these
relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design,
simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D
graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a
rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design
schedules of PC OEM and other manufacturers.
    
     We substantially increased our
engineering and technical resources in fiscal year 2008, and have 3,255
full-time employees engaged in research and development as of January 27, 2008,
compared to 2,668 employees as of January 28, 2007. The majority of the research
and development employees added during fiscal year 2008 are located in
international locations, including India, China, Taiwan and various locations in
Europe. During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred research and
development expenditures of $691.6 million, $553.5 million and
$357.1 million, respectively. Research and development expenses included

    Competition
    
      The market for GPUs,
MCPs, and application processors that support PMPs, PDAs, cellular phones or
other handheld devices is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid
technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling
prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are
performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution
channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application
Programming Interface, or APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of processors,
and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will
depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of
our products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase
from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be
less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features
not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors
or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market
share.
     
        A significant source of
competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide GPU, MCP, and
application processors that support PMPs, PDAs, cellular phones or other
handheld devices. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial,
distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to
adapt to customer or technological changes. Currently, Intel, which has greater
resources than we do, is working on a multi-core architecture code-named
Larrabee, which may compete with our products in various
markets.  Intel may also release an enthusiast level discrete GPU
based on the Larrabee architecture.  
    
      Our current competitors include
the following:
    
      · suppliers
of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of their existing
solutions, such as AMD, Broadcom Corporation, or Broadcom, Silicon Integrated
Systems, Inc., or SIS, VIA Technologies, Inc., or VIA, and
Intel;
    
      · suppliers
of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of
their existing solutions, such as AMD, Intel, Matrox Electronics Systems
Ltd., SIS, and VIA;
    
      · suppliers
of application processors that support PMPs, PDAs, cellular phones or other
handheld devices intellectual property such as AMD, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited,
Imagination Technologies Ltd., ARM Holdings plc, Marvell Technology Group Ltd,
or Marvell, NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Technology, Samsung,
Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and Toshiba America, Inc.;
and
    
      · suppliers
of application processors for handheld and embedded devices that incorporate
multimedia processing as part of their existing solutions such as Broadcom,
Texas Instruments Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Marvell, Freescale Semiconductor
Inc., Renesas Technology, Samsung, and ST Microelectronics.
     
        We expect substantial
competition from both Intel’s and AMD’s strategy of selling platform solutions,
such as the success Intel achieved with its Centrino platform solution. 
AMD has also announced a platform solution. Additionally, we expect that Intel
and AMD will extend this strategy to other segments, including the possibility
of successfully integrating a central processing unit, or CPU, and a GPU on the
same chip, as evidenced by AMD’s announcement of its Fusion processor project.
If AMD and Intel continue to pursue platform solutions, we may not be able to
successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted.
     
        If and to the extent we
offer products in new markets, we may face competition from some of our existing
competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We
cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we
may enter. If we are unable to compete in our current or new markets, demand for
our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our
financial results to suffer.

    Patents
and Proprietary Rights
    
      We rely primarily on a
combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual
property in the United States and internationally. Our issued patents have
expiration dates from October 29, 2008 to May 24, 2027.  We have
numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign
jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to
our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also
rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our
intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our
products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in
Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of
our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and
where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies
based on such factors as: 
     
    
      
          
            
              ·  
            
            
              the
      commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations
      in particular countries and
regions; 
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
              ·  
            
            
              the
      location in which our products are manufactured;
   
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
              ·  
            
            
              our
      strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and
       
            
          
      
    
    
      
          
            
              ·  
            
            
              the
      degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully
      enforced in different
jurisdictions. 
            
          
      
    
     
        Our pending patent
applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any
issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be
challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our
ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially
equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets
or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual
property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties
for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect
to continue to enter into such license agreements. These licenses may result in
royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or
payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on
commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.
     
    Employees
    
      As of January 27, 2008 we
had 4,985 employees, 3,255 of whom were engaged in research and development and
1,730 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations and administrative
positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees are
good.
    
    Financial
Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data
     
    
      Our Chief
Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
or CODM, reviews financial information presented on a operating segment basis
for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial
performance.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we
reorganized our operating segments. We now report financial information for four
operating segments to our CODM: the GPU business, which is comprised primarily
of our GeForce products that support desktop and notebook PCs, plus memory
products, the PSB, which is comprised of our NVIDIA Quadro professional
workstation products and other professional graphics products, including our
NVIDIA Tesla high-performance computing products, the MCP business, which
is comprised of NVIDIA nForce core logic and motherboard GPU products, and our
CPB which is comprised of our GoForce and APX mobile brands and products that
support handheld PMPs, PDAs, cellular phones, other handheld devices and
license, royalty, other revenue and associated costs related to video game
consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices.  In addition
to these operating segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes
human resources, legal, finance, general administration and corporate marketing
expenses, which total $266.2 million, $239.6 million, and $123.8
million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, that we do
not allocate to our other operating segments as these expenses are not included
in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our
CODM.  “All Other” also includes the results of operations of other
miscellaneous reporting segments that are neither individually reportable, nor
aggregated with another operating segment. Revenue in the “All Other” segment is
primarily derived from sales of components.  All relevant prior period
amounts have been revised to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal
year.
      
      Our CODM
does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
there is none to be reported.  The accounting policies for segment
reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.  The information included
in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is hereby
incorporated by reference.

      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
      
      In
evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered
in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment
involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below.
Additionally, any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price
to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations.
      
      Risks
Related to Competition
      
      If
we are unable to compete in the markets for our products, our financial results
could be adversely impacted.
      
      The
markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid
technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards,
and declining average selling prices. We believe that our ability to remain
competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and
functions that customers will demand from our products and whether we are able
to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable prices and quality
levels. We believe other factors impacting our ability to compete
are:
      
      
        
            
              
                ·

                manufacturing
      capabilities.
              
            
        
      
      
      We expect
competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants
with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better
performance or additional features not provided by our products, either of which
could harm our business. Some of these competitors may have or be able to
obtain greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources
than we do and may be better able to adapt to customer or technological changes.
Currently, Intel, which has greater resources than we do, is working on a
multi-core architecture code-named Larrabee, which may compete with our products
in various markets.  Intel may also release an enthusiast level
discrete GPU based on the Larrabee architecture. In order to compete, we may
have to invest substantial amounts in research and development without assurance
that our products will be superior to those of our competitors or that the
products will achieve market acceptance.
      
      An
additional significant source of competition comes from companies that provide
or intend to provide competing product solutions. For example, we are the
largest supplier of AMD 64 chipsets with 60% segment share in the fourth quarter
of calendar year 2007, as reported in the 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Processor and
Chipset report from Mercury Research. Decline in demand for our chipsets in the
AMD segment as a result of the offerings of a new or existing competitor could
materially impact our financial results.
      
      Our
current competitors include the following:
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                suppliers
      of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
      communications and input/output functionality as part of their existing
      solutions, such as AMD, Broadcom, Silicon Integrated Systems Corporation,
      or SIS, VIA Technologies, Inc., or VIA, and
  Intel;
              
            
        
      
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                suppliers

      If and to
the extent we offer products in new markets, we may face competition from some
of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do
not compete. We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any
new markets we may enter. If we are unable to compete in our current or new
markets, demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to
decline and our financial results to suffer.
      
      As
Intel and AMD continue to pursue platform solutions, we may not be able to
successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted.
      
      We expect
substantial competition from both Intel’s and AMD’s strategy of selling platform
solutions, such as the success Intel achieved with its Centrino platform
solution.  AMD has also announced a platform solution. Additionally, we
expect that Intel and AMD will extend this strategy to other segments, including
the possibility of successfully integrating a central processing unit, or CPU,
and a GPU on the same chip, as evidenced by AMD’s announcement of its Fusion
processor project. If AMD and Intel continue to pursue platform solutions, we
may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively
impacted.
      
      Risks
Related to Our Partners and Customers
      
      We
depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not
be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our
business.
      
      We do
not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or
operate a wafer fabrication facility.  Instead, industry-leading
foundries manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their state-of-the-art
fabrication equipment and techniques. The foundries, which have limited
capacity, also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies, including
some of our competitors.  Since we do not have long-term commitment
contracts with any of the foundries, they do not have an obligation to provide
us with any minimum quantity of product at any time or at any set price, except
as may be provided in a specific purchase order.   Most of our
products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time.  In times of
high demand, the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other
companies, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that
they charge us.  If we are unable to meet customer demand due to
reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products,
we could lose sales to customers, which would negatively impact our revenue and
our reputation.
      
      Because
the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new
manufacturing partner could be several quarters, we do not have an alternative
source of supply for our products. In addition, the time and effort to qualify a
new foundry could result in additional expense, diversion of resources, or lost
sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results. We believe
that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable
relationships with the third-party manufacturers we use to ensure adequate
product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer
demand.
       
      
        
           

        
        
          14
          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      Failure
to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively
impact our financial results and damage our reputation.
      
       Manufacturing
yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed
largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the
manufacturer. Low yields may result from either product design or process
technology failure.  We do not know a yield problem exists until our
design is manufactured.  When a yield issue is identified, the product
is analyzed and tested to determine the cause. As a result, yield problems may
not be identified until well into the production process. Resolution of yield
problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the
manufacturer. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry
capacity, decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our
costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers.
Lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships, our
reputation and our financial results.
      
      We
are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of our
products, which reduces our control over the delivery schedule and quantity of
our products.
      
      Our
products are assembled, tested and packaged by independent subcontractors, such
as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, JSI Logistics,
Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd., and
ChipPAC. As a result, we do not directly control our product delivery schedules,
product quantity, or product quality.  All of these subcontractors
assemble, test and package products for other companies, including some of our
competitors.  Since we do not have long-term agreements with our
subcontractors, when demand for subcontractors to assemble, test or package
products is high, our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of
other customers over our orders.  Since the time required to qualify a
different subcontractor to assemble, test or package our products can be
lengthy, if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience
significant delays in shipments of our products, product shortages, a decrease
in the quality of our products, or an increase in product cost. Any product
shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture,
assembly or testing of our products, which could cause our gross margin and
revenue to decline.
      
      Failure
to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect
our operating results and gross margin.
      
      We use
the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products
that is available from our third-party foundries. As a result, we continuously
evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process
technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We believe this
strategy will help us remain competitive.  Our current product
families are manufactured using 0.15 micron, 0.14 micron, 0.13 micron, 0.11
micron, 90 nanometer and 65 nanometer process
technologies.   Manufacturing process technologies are subject to
rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development,
which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross
margin.
      
      We have
experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past
and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries
and increased expense levels. We may face similar difficulties, delays and
expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry
processes. Moreover, we are dependent on our third-party manufacturers to
migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. Some of our competitors own
their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art
manufacturing process more quickly than our manufacturing
partners.  For example, Intel recently released a 45 nanometer
chip for desktop computers which it is manufacturing in its
foundries.  If our suppliers fall behind our competitors in
manufacturing processes, the development and customer demand for our products
and the use of our products could be negatively impacted. The inability by us or
our third-party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new
manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results
and our gross margin.

      We
rely on third-party vendors to supply software development tools to us for the
development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools
necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products.
      
      We rely
on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation
and verification of new products or product enhancements. To bring new products
or product enhancements to market in a timely manner, or at all, we need
software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically
advanced enough to complete our design, simulations and
verifications.  In the past, we have experienced delays in the
introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software
development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of
our products. In the future, the design requirements necessary to meet consumer
demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed
the capabilities of available software development
tools.  Unavailability of software development tools may result in our
missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a
loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results.
      
      Because
of the importance of software development tools to the development and
enhancement of our products, a critical component of our product development
efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry,
including Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc. We have invested
significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and
have often assisted them in the definition of their new products. We believe
that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools
to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront
of the 3D graphics, communications and networking segments and develop products
that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. If these relationships
are not successful, we may be unable to develop new products or product
enhancements in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of market share, a
decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results.
      
       We sell our products to a small
number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these
customers.
      
      We have a
limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. Sales to our
significant customers accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue from
one customer during fiscal year 2008, 12% of our total revenue from one customer
during fiscal year 2007, and 26% of our total revenue from two customers during
fiscal year 2006.  Although a small number of our other customers
represents the majority of our revenue, their end customers include a large
number of original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and system integrators
throughout the world who, in many cases, specify the graphics supplier. Our
sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading personal computer,
or PC, OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into
high volume production with key contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs,
original design manufacturers, or ODMs, add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder
channel that is serviced by CEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of
leading independent CEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, and
distributors, each of which has relationships with a broad range of system
builders and leading PC OEMs. If we were to lose sales to our PC OEMs, CEMs,
ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace the
lost sales with sales to different customers, they were to significantly reduce
the number of products they order from us, or we were unable to collect accounts
receivable from them, our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in
any period, which could harm our financial condition and our results of
operations.

      Any difficulties
in collecting accounts receivable, including from foreign customers, could harm
our operating results and financial condition.
       
      Our
accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse
changes in our customers' businesses, and to downturns in the industry and the
worldwide economy.  Two customers accounted for approximately 21% and
23% of our accounts receivable balance at January 27, 2008 and
January 28, 2007, respectively.
      
      Difficulties
in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. We continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may
be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them. We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an amount
identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated
exposure. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on
sales to affected customers, and we may be required to pay higher credit
insurance premiums, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.
In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs and/or
defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our
financial results.
      
      Risks
Related to Our Business and Products
      
      Our
failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our
financial results.
      
      Our
inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts or orders from our
customers and may not accurately predict the quantity or type of products that
our customers will want or will ultimately end up purchasing. In forecasting
demand, we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result
in write-downs of the value of our inventory and/or a reduction in average
selling prices, and where our gross margin could be adversely affected
include:
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                if
      there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our
      products;

                if
      there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly
      changing technology and customer
requirements;
              
            
        
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                if
      we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our
      newer products are introduced; or

                if
      our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing
      actions.
              
            
        
      
      
      Conversely,
if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products, our third party
manufacturing partners may not have adequate capacity to increase production for
us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our
customers’ orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production
levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost effective
or timely manner. Inability to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis,
or at all, could damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue,
cause a loss in market share, impact our customer relationships or damage our
reputation, any of which could adversely impact our business.
      
      
        
           

        
        
          17
          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      Because
we order products or materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our
ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to
lower than expected demand is limited.
      
      We
manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have
shorter shipment lead times for our customers.  As a result, we may
build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may
build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not
materialize.  Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted
resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of
customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which
could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund
operations. Additionally, because we often sell a substantial portion of our
products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our
inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer
cancellations or deferrals. We could be subject to excess or obsolete
inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write-downs if
growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product
demand, which could negatively impact our financial
results.  
      
      Our
business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts
are unsuccessful.
      
      In the
past, we have experienced delays in the development of new products. Any delay
or failure of our GPUs, our other products, or other technologies to meet or
exceed specifications of our customers or competitive products could materially
harm our business if customers do not buy our products. The success of our new
product introductions will depend on many factors, including the
following:

      Our
failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new
processors or other technologies could impact our revenue, gross margin and
other financial results.
      
      Our
failure to identify new market or product opportunities or to develop new
products could harm our business.
      
      As our
GPUs and other processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that
product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices
will decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins
for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume
increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements
to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices and
our gross margin. In order for our processors to achieve high volumes, leading
PC OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our
processors for design into their products, and then successfully complete the
designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully
identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new
products in a timely fashion. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that new
products we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’, ODMs’, or add-in
board and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be
successfully completed, or that any new products will be sold.

      As the
complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products
increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the
performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development,
introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties
related to the production of current or future products or other factors that
may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop. In
addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition
risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing
with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly
declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for
products or loss of market share. In addition, products or technologies
developed by others may render our processors non-competitive or obsolete or
result in our holding excess inventory, which would harm our
business.
      
      If
we are unable to achieve design wins, our products may not be adopted by our
target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our
financial results.
       
      The
success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to
develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers. We
believe achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future
products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by OEMs, ODMs,
add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, are an integral part of our future
success. Our OEM, ODM, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers
typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year,
typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade
shows. Accordingly, when our customers are making their design decisions, our
existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely
introduce new products in order to be included in our customers’ new system
configurations. This requires that we:
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                anticipate
      the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand;
       
              
            
        
      
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                incorporate
      those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting
      design requirements of our customers;

      our products competitively; and

                introduce
      products to the market within our customers’ limited design cycles.
       
              
            
        
      
       
      If OEMs,
ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products
in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems
until at least the next design configuration. Therefore, we endeavor to develop
close relationships with our OEMs and ODMs, in an attempt to better anticipate
and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design
wins.
       
      Our
ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify
and be compliant with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in
industry standards could render our products incompatible with products
developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers like Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, Intel and Microsoft Corporation, or
Microsoft.  If our products are not in compliance with prevailing
industry standards, we may not be designed into our customers’ product
designs.  However, to be compliant with changes to industry standards,
we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products
which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results. If we are
unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers, we may lose
market share and our operating results would be negatively
impacted.
      
      
        
           

        
        
          19
          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      We
may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated,
which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating
results.
      
      If new
competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new
markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater
resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our
operating expenses would increase. We have increased our engineering and
technical resources and had 3,255, 2,668 and 1,654 full-time employees engaged
in research and development as of January 27, 2008, January 28, 2007 and January
29, 2006, respectively.  Research and development expenditures were
$691.6 million, $553.5 million and $357.1 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively.  Research and development expenses included
non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $76.6 million and $70.1 million in
fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to non-cash stock based
compensation, which we began to record in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007
as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). If we are required to invest
significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development
efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to
the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development
and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could
negatively impact our financial results. In order to remain competitive, which
may include entering new markets, we anticipate that we will continue to devote
substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses
to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased
complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as
hiring additional employees.
      
      If
our products contain significant defects our financial results could be
negatively impacted, our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market
share.
      
      Our
products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures when first
introduced or when we release new versions or enhancements. Past products have
and future products or enhancements may contain defects, errors or
bugs. Our products typically only go through one verification cycle prior
to volume production and distribution. As a result, our products may
contain undetected defects or flaws prior to volume production and
distribution.  If any of our products or technologies contains a
defect, compatibility issue or other error, we may have to invest additional
research and development efforts to find and correct the issue.  Such
efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the
development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating
costs and gross margin. Additionally, an error or defect in new products or
releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments
could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design
wins. Also, we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair
or replace the products in the field, which could cause our revenue to
decline. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could
be expensive, damage our reputation, or result in our customers working with our
competitors. Costs associated with correcting defects, errors, bugs or
other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial
results. 
      
      Because
our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, our failure to
forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross
margin.
       
      We
continue to pursue improved gross margin. Our gross margin for any period
depends on a number of factors, including:

      If we do
not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our
business, we may not be able to take action in time to counteract any negative
impact on our gross margin. In addition, if we are unable to meet our gross
margin target for any period or the target set by analysts, the trading price of
our common stock may decline.
      
      We
may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of
business acquisitions or strategic investments, which could hurt our ability to
grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing
products and business. We may enter into future acquisitions of, or investments
in, businesses, in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter
into a new business market. Negotiations associated with an acquisition or
strategic investment could divert management’s attention and other company
resources. Any of the following risks associated with past or future
acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business,
develop new products, our ability to sell our products, and ultimately could
have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results:

      In
addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash,
shares of our common stock, the issuance of convertible debt securities or a
combination of cash, convertible debt and common stock. If we make an investment
in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition, our cash
reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our
business or our ability to develop new products. However, if we pay the
consideration with shares of common stock, or convertible debentures, the
holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted. We cannot forecast the
number, timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions, or the
effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or
financial results.

      We
are dependent on key employees and the loss of any of these employees could
negatively impact our business.
      
      Our
future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability
to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified key
personnel.  The market for key employees in the semiconductor industry
can be competitive.  None of our key employees is bound by an
employment agreement, meaning our relationships with all of our key employees
are at will.  The loss of the services of any of these employees without an
adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could
delay our product development efforts, harm our ability to sell our products or
otherwise negatively impact our business.
      
      Our
operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may not be able to reduce
operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls.
      
      Our
operating expenses, which are comprised of research and development expenses and
sales, general and administrative expenses, represented 25%, 28% and 24% of our
total revenue during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of $122.5 million and $108.5 million in fiscal years 2008
and 2007, respectively, related to non-cash stock based compensation which we
began to record in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 as a result of our
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No.
123(R), Share-Based
Payment. Since
we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of
each quarter, we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely
manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls. Further, some of our
operating expenses, like non-cash stock-based compensation expense can only be
adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a
quarter.  If we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in
response to any revenue shortfalls, our financial results would be negatively
impacted.
      
      Expensing
employee stock options materially and adversely affects our reported operating
results and could also adversely affect our competitive position.
      
      Since
inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as
fundamental components of our compensation packages. We believe that these
incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting,
encourage our employees to remain with us. As a result of adjustments
arising from our restatement related to stock option grant dates, our operating
results for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2007 contain recorded amounts of
stock-based compensation expense. For our fiscal years 2000 through 2006, this
stock-based compensation expense was calculated using primarily the intrinsic
value-based method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, or APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations.
      
      In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
issued SFAS No. 123(R) which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation payments.  SFAS
No. 123(R) requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and
our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards. During
the fiscal years 2008 and 2007 we recorded $133.4 million and $116.7 million,
respectively, related to non-cash stock-based compensation, resulting from our
compliance with SFAS No. 123(R), which negatively impacted our operating
results. We believe that SFAS No. 123(R) will continue to negatively impact our
operating results.
      
      To the
extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to
continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur
increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take to
reduce stock-based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions
our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and
motivate employees, which could adversely affect our competitive position as
well as our business and operating results.

      We
may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets become impaired, which could negatively impact our operating
results.
      
      Under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our
amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is
tested for impairment at least annually. The carrying value of our goodwill or
amortizable assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in
stock price and market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows
and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units.
Estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated long-term financial
outlook of our operations. However, actual performance in the near-term or
long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact
future estimates. For example, if one of our business units does not meet its
near-term and longer-term forecasts, the goodwill assigned to the business unit
could be impaired. We may be required to record a charge to earnings in our
financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or
amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which may negatively
impact our results of operations.
      
      Our
operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating
results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
trading price of our stock could decline.
       
      Many of
our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our operating
expenses are largely independent of revenue. Therefore, it is difficult for us
to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular
period.
      
      Any one
or more of the risks discussed in this Form 10-K or other factors could prevent
us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Accordingly, we
believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should
not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Similarly, the
results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal
year.
      
      As a
result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be
below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause
the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that our quarterly
and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of
factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of
operations.
      
      Risks
related to Market Conditions
      
      We
are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments
and in interest rates.
       
       At
January 27, 2008 and January 28, 2007, we had $1.81 billion and $1.12 billion,
respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.  We
invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and
cash equivalents, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money
market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities
and the United States government and its agencies. As of January 27, 2008,
we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. These
investments are denominated in United States dollars.
       
      
        
           

        
        
          23
          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      We
account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities. All of the cash equivalents and marketable
securities are treated as “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments
in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree
of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value
adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in
part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of
expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of
our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be
other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell
securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates.
However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as
“available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in income statement
due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to
maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be
other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the
related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income, a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax.
      
      Recent
U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various
sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues.
The short-term funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth
quarter of calendar 2007, leading to liquidity disruption in the market. If the
global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be
impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which
could adversely impact our financial results. As of January 27, 2008, we did not
have any issuer concentration in excess of 10% of our investment portfolio.
However, our investments in the financial sector and government agencies
accounted for approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of our total investment
portfolio. If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline
by 2%-5%, it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments
by approximately $22-$54 million.
      
      We
are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our
business.
       
      We
conduct our business worldwide.  Our semiconductor wafers are
manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third-parties located outside of
the United States. We generated 89%, 86% and 84% of total revenues for fiscal
years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from sales to customers outside the
United States and other Americas. As of January 27, 2008, we had offices in
twelve countries outside of the United States.  The manufacture,
assembly, test and packaging of our products outside of the United States,
operation of offices outside of the United States, and sales to customers
internationally subjects us to a number of risks, including:

          24
          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      Our
international operations in Australia, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong,
India, France, Russia, Germany, Finland and the United Kingdom are subject to
many of the above listed risks. We intend to continue to expand our existing
operations and expect to open other international offices. Difficulties with our
international operations, including finding appropriate staffing and office
space, may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could
negatively impact our operating results.
      
      The
economic conditions in our primary overseas markets, particularly in Asia, may
negatively impact the demand for our products abroad. All of our international
sales to date have been denominated in United States dollars. Accordingly,
an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign
currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or
require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign
currencies. We anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a
greater degree as we further expand our international business
activities.
      
      If
our products do not continue to be adopted by the desktop PC, notebook PC,
workstation, high-performance computing, PMP, PDA, cellular handheld devices,
and video game console markets or if the demand for new and innovative products
in these markets decreases, our business and operating results would
suffer.
      
      Our
success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3D
graphics and multimedia in desktop PC, notebook PC, workstation,
high-performance computing, PMP, PDA, cellular handheld devices, and video game
console applications. The market for processors has been characterized by
unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often
caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in
pricing of dynamic random-access memory devices and other changes in the total
system cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by
frequent new technology and product introductions. Broad market acceptance is
difficult to achieve and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to
sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product
introductions. Our GPU and MCP businesses together comprised of approximately
79%, 77% and 74% of revenue for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
As such, our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or
future GPUs or MCPs do not continue to achieve widespread adoption by the PC
market. If we are unable to complete the timely development of new products or
if we were unable to successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver
products that meet the requirements of the desktop PC, notebook PC, workstation,
high-performance computing, PMP, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console
markets, we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact
our operating results.
      
      Additionally,
there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products
with improved standards, features or performance. If our customers, OEMs, ODMs,
add-in-card and motherboard manufacturers, system builders and consumer
electronics companies, do not continue to design products that require more
advanced or efficient processors and/or the market does not continue to demand
new products with increased performance, features, functionality or standards,
sales of our products could decline. Decreased sales of our products for these
markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial
results.
      
      We
are dependent on the PC market and its rate of growth in the future may have a
negative impact on our business.
      
      We derive
and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale
or license of products for use in the desktop PC and notebook PC markets,
including professional workstations. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction
in the growth rate of PC sales, may reduce demand for our products. These
changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build
inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess
inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions.
In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all
purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess
inventory has been absorbed, which would have a negative impact on our financial
results.

      Our
business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial
results.
      
      Our
business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical
semiconductor industry, including alternating periods of overcapacity and
capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing costs and yields, significant
expenditures for capital equipment and product development, and rapid
technological change. If we are unable to respond to changes in our industry,
which can be unpredictable and rapid, in an efficient and timely manner, our
operating results could suffer. In particular, from time to time, the
semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged
downturns characterized by diminished product demand, increased inventory levels
and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. If we cannot take appropriate
actions such as reducing our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently
offset declines in demand, increased inventories, or decreased selling prices
during a downturn, our revenue and operating results will suffer.
      
      Risks
Related to Regulatory and other Legal Matters
      
      The
United States Department of Justice’s pending investigation into the market
for graphics processors and the ongoing civil actions could adversely affect our
business.
      
      On
November 29, 2006, we received a subpoena from the San Francisco Office of the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, in
connection with the DOJ's investigation into potential antitrust violations
related to GPUs and cards. No specific allegations have been made against us. We
are cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation.
      
      As of
March 5, 2008, 55 civil complaints have been filed against us. The majority of
the complaints were filed in the Northern District of California, several were
filed in the Central District of California, and other cases were filed in
several other Federal district courts.  On April 18, 2007, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the actions currently
pending outside of the Northern District of California to the Northern District
of California for coordination of pretrial proceedings before the Honorable
William H. Alsup.  By agreement of the parties, Judge Alsup will
retain jurisdiction over the consolidated cases through trial or other
resolution.
      
      In the
consolidated proceedings, two groups of plaintiffs (one representing all direct
purchasers of graphic processing units, or GPUs, and the other representing all
indirect purchasers) filed consolidated, amended class-action complaints. These
complaints purport to assert federal antitrust claims based on alleged price
fixing, market allocation, and other alleged anti-competitive agreements between
us and ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI and AMD, as a result of its acquisition of
ATI.  The indirect purchasers’ consolidated amended complaint also
asserts a variety of state law antitrust, unfair competition and consumer
protection claims on the same allegations, as well as a common law claim for
unjust enrichment.
      
      Plaintiffs
filed their first consolidated complaints on June 14, 2007.  On July
16, 2007, we moved to dismiss those complaints.  The motions to
dismiss were heard by Judge Alsup on September 20, 2007.  The Court
subsequently granted and denied the motions in part, and gave the
plaintiffs leave to move to amend the complaints.  On November 7,
2007, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file amended complaints, ordered
defendants to answer the complaints, lifted a previously entered stay on
discovery, and set a trial date for January 12, 2009.  Discovery is
underway and plaintiffs are currently required to file any motion for class
certification by April 24, 2008.  We believe the allegations in
the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the
cases.  Costs of defense and any damages resulting from a ruling
against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our
business.

      The
matters relating to the Board’s review of our historical stock option granting
practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have
resulted in litigation, which could harm our financial results.
      
      On August
10, 2006, we announced that the Audit Committee of our Board, with the
assistance of outside legal counsel, was conducting a review of our stock option
practices covering the time from our initial public offering in 1999, our fiscal
year 2000, through June 2006. The Audit Committee reached the conclusion that
incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for
stock option grants in certain prior periods. As a result, we recorded
additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax effects,
related to stock option grants.
      
      The Audit
Committee’s review of our historic stock option practices identified a number of
occasions on which the measurement date used for financial accounting and
reporting purposes for stock options granted to certain of our employees was
different from the actual grant date. To correct these accounting errors, we
amended our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 29, 2006 and
our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended April 30, 2006 to
restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those
reports.  This review of our historical stock option granting
practices and subsequent restatement required us to incur substantial expenses
for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services and diverted our
management’s attention from our business.
      
      Additionally,
the review and the resulting restatement of our prior financial statements have
exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation. Ten derivative
complaints have been filed in state and federal court pertaining to allegations
relating to stock option grants. We cannot assure you that these or future
similar complaints, or any future litigation or regulatory action will result in
the same conclusions reached by the Audit Committee. On August 5, 2007, our
Board authorized the formation of a Special Litigation Committee to investigate,
evaluate, and make a determination as to how we should proceed with respect to
the claims and allegations asserted in the underlying derivative cases brought
on behalf of NVIDIA.  Currently, the Special Litigation Committee’s
review is ongoing.  The conduct and resolution of these matters will
be time consuming, expensive and could distract our management’s attention from
the conduct of our business.  Furthermore, if we are subject to
adverse rulings, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other
remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.
      
      Our
ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our
intellectual property.
      
      We rely primarily on a combination of
patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in
the United States and internationally. We have numerous patents issued, allowed
and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and
pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology
used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,
organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of
certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or
sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more
likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for
particular innovations and technologies based on such factors
as:

      Our
pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In
addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or
may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our
trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our
intellectual property could harm our business.
      
      Litigation
to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to
enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation
could result in substantial costs to us.
      
      We expect
that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as
competition intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims
and lawsuits may increase. We may become involved in lawsuits or other legal
proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights
violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for
certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant
damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of
customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive
relief.
      
      In
addition, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order
to:

      If we
have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property, our
operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating
results. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm
our business.
      
      If
infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to
infringe a third parties’ patent or intellectual property, we or one of our
indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties’ patent or
other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors.
If we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a
third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products,
we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue
the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products.  We may also
have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If
these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our
business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a
customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our
operating results.
      
      We
are a party to litigation, which, if determined adversely to us, could adversely
affect our cash flow and financial results.
      
      We are a
party to litigation. There can be no assurance that any litigation to which we
are a party will be resolved in our favor. Any claim that is successfully
asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages, including punitive
damages, and other related fees. Regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in
our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation, any
lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to
defend or resolve. Such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing
customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away
from business operations, which could harm our business. Costs of defense and
any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of
the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial
results.

      Our
operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax
liabilities.
      
      We are
subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States
and throughout the world. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we
operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our
income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially
different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals:

      previously uncertain; and

      Should
additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above, our operating
results could be adversely affected. In addition, our future effective tax rate
could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or changes in the
interpretation of tax laws.
      
      Our
failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in
a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, excess
inventory, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities.
      
      We are
subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations
governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain
substances in electronic products and making producers of those products
financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of
those products. For example, we are subject to the European Union Directive on
Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS Directive, that restricts
the use of a number of substances, including lead, and other hazardous
substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the European
Union.    We could face significant costs and liabilities in
connection with the European Union Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment, or WEEE. The WEEE directs members of the European Union to enact
laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of
electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the
collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of
certain products sold into the market after August 15, 2005.
      
      It is
possible that unanticipated supply shortages, delays or excess non-compliant
inventory may occur as a result of the RoHS Directive, WEEE, and other
domestic or international environmental regulations. Failure to comply with any
applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences
including costs, fines, suspension of production, excess inventory, sales
limitations, criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability to
conduct business in the countries or states that have adopted these types of
regulations.

      While we believe that we have
adequate internal control over financial reporting, if we or our independent
registered public accounting firm determines that we do not, our reputation may
be adversely affected and our stock price may decline. 
      
      Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our
independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our
internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have an
ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing
necessary to comply with these requirements. However, the manner in which
companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements
and testing companies’ internal controls, remains subject to some judgment. To
date, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and
to devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance.
Despite our efforts, if we identify a material weakness in our internal
controls, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that
material weakness in a timely manner, or that we will be able to maintain all of
the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial
reporting is effective. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine
that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined
under Section 404, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and
could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.
      
      Changes in financial accounting
standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported
results of operations.
       
         We prepare our
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States.  These principles are
constantly subject to review and interpretation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or, SEC, and various bodies formed to interpret and create
appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect
previously reported transactions.
      
      Provisions in our certificate of
incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or
prevent a change in control.  
      
      Our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it
more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting
stock. These provisions include the following:
       
      
        
            
              
                ·  
              
              
                the
      ability of our Board to create and issue preferred stock without prior
      stockholder approval;

      notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder
      proposals.
              
            
        
      
      
      On March
5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to
develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft
and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or
corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last
rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other
factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of
NVIDIA.
