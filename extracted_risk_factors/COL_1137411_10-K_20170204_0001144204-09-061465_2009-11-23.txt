Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one or more of which could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. 

A global recession and tight credit availability adversely affects us. 

Global recession and tight credit availability, including failures of financial institutions, initiated unprecedented government intervention in the U.S., Europe and other regions of the world. If these concerns continue or worsen, risks to us include: 





          

          •

          declines in revenues and profitability from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers 









          

          •

          reprioritization of government spending away from defense programs in which we participate 









          

          •

          adverse impacts on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources 









          

          •

          supply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers 





International conflicts and terrorism may adversely affect our business. 

International conflicts such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, political turmoil in the Middle and Far East and the possibility of future terrorist attacks cause significant uncertainty with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets and may adversely affect our business. These international conflicts also affect the price of oil, which has a significant impact on the financial health of our commercial customers. Although our Government Systems business may experience greater demand for its products as a result of increased government defense spending, factors arising (directly or indirectly) from international conflicts or terrorism
which may adversely affect our business include reduced aircraft build rates, upgrades, maintenance and spending on discretionary products such as in-flight entertainment, as well as increases in the cost of property and aviation products insurance and increased restrictions placed on our insurance policies. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan create the risk that our Government Systems customers may need to redirect funding from our existing business to pay for war-related activities. Furthermore, we currently hold only nominal insurance related to the effects of terrorist acts on our assets and our aircraft products. 

We depend to a significant degree on U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. 

In 2009, 43 percent of our sales were derived from U.S. Government contracts. In addition to normal business risks, our supply of systems and products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks which are largely beyond our control. These risks include: 





          

          •

          dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds 









          

          •

          the ability of the U.S. Government to terminate, without prior notice, partially completed government programs and contracts that were previously authorized 









          

          •

          changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political developments 









          

          •

          significant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries

TABLE OF CONTENTS





          

          •

          intense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development 









          

          •

          difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work 









          

          •

          changes over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, which generally result in adjustments of contract prices 









          

          •

          claims based on U.S. Government work, which may result in fines, the cancellation or suspension of payments or suspension or debarment proceedings affecting potential further business with the U.S. Government 





Our business is heavily concentrated in the aviation industry. 

As a provider of products and services to the aviation industry, we are significantly affected by the overall economic condition of that industry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical. 

Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted, among other things, by the following: 





          

          •

          reductions in demand for aircraft and delayed aircraft delivery schedules 









          

          •

          challenges in the financial condition of some of our existing and potential customers 









          

          •

          reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support 









          

          •

          retirement or storage of older generation aircraft, resulting in fewer retrofits and less demand for services for those aircraft 









          

          •

          limited availability of financing for airlines or aircraft 









          

          •

          high fuel costs 









          

          •

          health pandemics or other disruptions to commercial air travel demand 





New airspace management technologies may impact future sales. 

The aerospace industry is experiencing a global transition from traditional communications, navigation, surveillance and air traffic control systems to air traffic management systems utilizing satellite-based technologies that will allow pilots to fly at desired paths and speeds selected in real time, while still complying with instrument flight regulations. The transition to these technologies will require the use of digital communications systems, global positioning system navigation, satellite surveillance techniques and ground surveillance systems. These technologies are expected to result in more direct and efficient flight routes, fewer flight
delays and reduced airport congestion. Although we believe that we are well positioned to participate in this market evolution, our ability to capitalize on the transition to these airspace management technologies is subject to various risks, including: 





          

          •

          delays in the development of the necessary satellite and ground infrastructure by U.S. and other governments 









          

          •

          delays in adopting national and international regulatory standards 









          

          •

          competitors developing better products 









          

          •

          failure of our product development investments in communications, navigation and surveillance products that enable airspace management technologies to coincide with market evolution to, and demand for, these products 









          

          •

          the ability and desire of customers to invest in products enabling airspace management technologies

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S. 

In 2009, revenues from products and services exported from the U.S. or manufactured and serviced abroad were 31 percent of our total sales. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: 





          

          •

          laws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad 









          

          •

          changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions and antitrust and data privacy requirements 









          

          •

          uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees 









          

          •

          requirements of certain customers to have us agree to specified levels of in-country purchases or investments, known as offsets, and penalties if we fail to meet these offset requirements 









          

          •

          import and export licensing requirements and regulations 









          

          •

          uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 









          

          •

          rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation 





We have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. 

We completed four acquisitions in the last three years and we intend to enter into acquisitions in the future in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties such as: 





          

          •

          the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration 









          

          •

          the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions 









          

          •

          the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 









          

          •

          the risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties 









          

          •

          the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 









          

          •

          the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations 





We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. 

During 2009, approximately 88 percent of our total sales were from, and a significant portion of our anticipated future sales will be from, firm, fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can incur losses on these contracts. These fixed-price contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the customer may compel us to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the entire incremental cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size
of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these projects involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with subcontractors and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate.

addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 

Costs of certain employee and retiree benefits may continue to rise. 

Although we have taken action seeking to contain volatility in the costs related to medical and pension benefits, there are risks that our costs for these benefits will increase as a result of: 





          

          •

          continued increases in medical costs related to current employees due to increased usage of medical benefits and medical inflation 









          

          •

          material changes in legislation impacting medical or pension matters 









          

          •

          the effect declines in the stock and bond markets have on the performance of our pension plan assets 









          

          •

          potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our retirement benefit obligations 





Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability 

Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures.
