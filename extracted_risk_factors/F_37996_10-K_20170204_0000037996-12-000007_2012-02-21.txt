ITEM 1A. Risk FactorsWe have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) the most significant risk factors applicable to us:Decline in industry sales volume, particularly in the United States or Europe, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors.  In the fall of 2008, the global economy entered a financial crisis and severe recession, putting significant pressure on us and on the automotive industry generally.  These economic conditions dramatically reduced automotive industry sales volume in the United States and Europe, in particular, and began to slow growth in other markets around the world.  U.S. automotive industry sales volume declined from 16.5 million units in 2007 to 13.5 million units in 2008 and 10.6 million units in 2009, before rebounding slightly to 11.8 million units in 2010 and 13 million units in 2011.  For the 19 markets we track in Europe, automotive industry sales volume declined from 18.1 million units in 2007 to 16.6 million units in 2008, 15.9 million units in 2009, and 15.3 million units in 2010 and 2011.Because we, like other manufacturers, have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and profitability.  If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, particularly in the United States or Europe, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations would be substantially adversely affected.  For discussion of economic trends, see the "Overview" section of Item 7.Decline in market share or failure to achieve growth.  Our full-year U.S. market share declined each year between 1995 and 2008, declining from 18% to 14.2% from 2004 to 2008 alone.  With our One Ford plan, we have seen U.S. market share gains in the last three years.  To maintain competitive economies of scale and grow our global market share, however, we also must grow our market share in fast-growing newly-developed and emerging markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, as well as maintain or grow market share in mature markets.  Our market share in certain growing markets, such as China, is substantially lower than it is in our mature markets.  A decline in our market share in mature markets, whether due to capacity constraints, competitive pressures, or other factors, or failure to achieve growth in newly-developed or emerging markets, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of new or existing products.  Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products in the marketplace.  Offering highly desirable vehicles that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but vehicles that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.  For example, if a new model were to experience quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle's perceived quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting in lower sales volumes, market share, and profitability.Market shift away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles beyond our current planning assumption, particularly in the United States.  A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles at levels beyond our current planning assumption could result in an immediate and substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  For example, when gasoline prices in the United States spiked to more than $4.00 per gallon in 2008 and the construction industry suddenly slowed, consumer preferences quickly and dramatically shifted away from larger, more profitable vehicles and into smaller vehicles.  We estimate that shifting consumer preferences across all vehicle segments adversely impacted our Automotive operating pre-tax earnings and cash flow in 2008 by about $1.3 billion.  Although we now have a more balanced portfolio of small, medium, and large, cars, utilities, and trucks that generally are more fuel efficient and contribute higher margins than in 2008, and a lower cost structure, a shift in consumer preferences away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles at levels greater than our current planning assumption - whether because of spiking fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, government actions or incentives, or other reasons - still could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.An increase in or continued volatility of fuel prices, or reduced availability of fuel.  An increase in fuel prices, continued price volatility, or reduced availability of fuel, particularly in the United States, could result in further weakening of demand for relatively more-profitable large cars, utilities, and trucks, while increasing demand for relatively less-profitable small vehicles.  Continuation or acceleration of such a trend beyond our current planning assumption, or volatility in demand across segments, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.17. Risk Factors (continued)                                    Work stoppages at Ford or supplier facilities or other limitations on production (whether as a result of labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, production constraints or difficulties, or other factors).  A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford or supplier facilities for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, or as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints or difficulties, or for other reasons.  Recent examples of situations that have affected industry production to varying degrees include: supplier financial distress as production volumes decreased during the economic downturn in 2008 - 2009; capacity constraints as suppliers that restructured or downsized during the downturn work to satisfy growing industry volumes; short-term constraints on production as consumer preferences shift more fluidly across vehicle segments and features; and the impact on certain suppliers of natural disasters during 2011.  As indicated, a work stoppage or other limitations on production at Ford or supplier facilities for any reason (including but not limited to labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, or production constraints or difficulties) could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Single-source supply of components or materials.  Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).  In addition to the general risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component. Labor or other constraints on our ability to maintain competitive cost structure.  Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  As indicated, we negotiated a new four-year agreement with the UAW in 2011, and will negotiate a new agreement with the CAW in 2012.  Although we have negotiated transformational agreements in recent years, the agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of employment security, subject to certain conditions.  As a practical matter, these agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.  A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities.Substantial pension and postretirement health care and life insurance liabilities impairing our liquidity or financial condition.  We have qualified defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover our hourly and salaried employees.  We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.  In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor plans to provide other postretirement benefits ("OPEB") for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).  See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.  These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us that are not fully funded and will require additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity.Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans are subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Under Title IV of ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has the authority under certain circumstances or upon the occurrence of certain events to terminate an underfunded pension plan.  One such circumstance is the occurrence of an event that unreasonably increases the risk of unreasonably large losses to the PBGC.  Although we believe it is unlikely that the PBGC would terminate any of our plans, in the event that our U.S. pension plans were terminated at a time when the liabilities of the plans exceeded the assets of the plans we would incur a liability to the PBGC that could be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding.At December 31, 2011, our U.S. and worldwide (including U.S.) defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a total of $9.4 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively.  If our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to fund our pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Worse-than-assumed economic and demographic experience for our postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns).  The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.  We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).  To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, there could be a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  For discussion of our assumptions, see "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.19. Risk Factors (continued)                                    A change in our requirements where we have long-term supply arrangements committing us to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of certain parts, or to pay a minimum amount to the seller ("take-or-pay" contracts).  We have entered into a number of long-term supply contracts that require us to purchase a fixed quantity of parts to be used in the production of our vehicles.  If our need for any of these parts were to lessen, we could still be required to purchase a specified quantity of the part or pay a minimum amount to the seller pursuant to the take-or-pay contract, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Adverse effects on our results from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments.  We receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production.  These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits.  The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.  For example, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America are located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments have historically offered, and continue to offer, significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.  As a result, the performance of our South American operations has been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent as we have increased our investment and manufacturing presence in Brazil, and we expect this favorable impact to continue for the next several years.  A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to fund new investments.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of the accounting for government incentives, and "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for discussion of administrative tax proceedings in Brazil.Inherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements and safeguarding of assets.  Our internal control over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements or loss of assets because of  inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets.Cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, or infrastructure owned by us or a third-party vendor, or at a supplier facility.  Interruptions, outages, or breaches of operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, data processing, in-vehicle, or manufacturing processes), security systems, or infrastructure, as a result of cyber incidents, could materially disrupt critical operations, disclose confidential intellectual property, and/or give rise to allegations of or result in a breach of data privacy or other regulations within or outside the United States. Failure of financial institutions to fulfill commitments under committed credit facilities.  Under our secured Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2006, as amended and restated on November 24, 2009 and as further amended ("Credit Agreement"), we are able to borrow, repay, and then re-borrow up to $8.9 billion until the facility terminates.  If the financial institutions that provide these or other committed credit facilities were to default on their obligation to fund the commitments, these facilities would not be available to us, which could substantially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.  For discussion of our Credit Agreement, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.Inability of Ford Credit to access debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts, due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.  In 2005 and 2006, the credit ratings assigned to Ford Credit were lowered to below investment grade, which increased its unsecured borrowing costs and restricted its access to the unsecured debt markets.  In response, Ford Credit increased its use of securitization transactions (including other structured financings) and other sources of funding.  Although Ford Credit has experienced several credit rating upgrades in the past two years and its credit spreads have narrowed considerably, its credit ratings remain below investment grade and Ford Credit still utilizes asset-backed securitization transactions for a substantial amount of its funding.Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit's ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.  Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.  In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there were a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit was unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.  A significant reduction in the amount of 21Item 1A. Risk Factors (continued)                                    receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing profits and could substantially adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.Higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.  Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer's or dealer's failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit's business.  The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.  Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction.  Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles.  Actual return volumes may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease end values relative to auction values, marketing programs for new vehicles, and general economic conditions.  Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit's profitability if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit's projections.  See "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7 for additional discussion. Increased competition from banks or other financial institutions seeking to increase their share of financing Ford vehicles.  No single company is a dominant force in the automotive finance industry.  Most of Ford Credit's bank competitors in the United States use credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send, through standardized systems, retail credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these finance sources.  This process has resulted in greater competition based on financing rates.  In addition, Ford Credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for Ford dealers.  Competition from such competitors with lower borrowing costs may increase, which could substantially adversely affect Ford Credit's profitability and the volume of its business.New or increased credit, consumer, or data protection or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or additional financing restrictions.  As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business.  In the United States, for example, Ford Credit's operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Congress also passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Act") in 2010 to reform practices in the financial services industries, including automotive financing and securitizations.  The Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the consumer finance industry and the capital markets and, among other things, gives the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that will regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit's retail automotive financing business.  The Act also creates an alternative liquidation framework under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") may be appointed as receiver of a non-bank financial company if the U.S. Treasury Secretary (in consultation with the President of the United States) determines that the company is in default or danger of default and the resolution of the company under other applicable law (e.g., U.S. bankruptcy law) would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States.  The FDIC's powers under this framework may vary from those of a bankruptcy court under U.S. bankruptcy law, which could adversely impact securitization markets, including Ford Credit's funding activities, regardless of whether Ford Credit ever is determined to be subject to the Act's alternative liquidation framework.  Federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations necessary to implement the Act, and, consequently, the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the consumer finance industry may not be known for years.  The Act and its implementing rules and regulations could impose additional costs on Ford Credit and adversely affect its ability to conduct its business.In some countries outside the United States, Ford Credit's subsidiaries are regulated banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital reserves.  In many other locations, governmental authorities require companies to have licenses in order to conduct financing businesses.  Efforts to comply with these laws and regulations impose significant costs on Ford Credit, and affect the conduct of its business.  Additional regulation could add significant cost or operational constraints that might impair Ford Credit's profitability.22ITEM 1B
