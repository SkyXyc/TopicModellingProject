STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%">The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced
availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions,
and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  <FONT

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our
operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are
currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available
for operations.  We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state
divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and
cash available for operations.    We are subject to increasingly
stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We
incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement.
These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party.
Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.  <FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of
existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that
could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.   
We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
   Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such
as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An
accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events,
including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made
under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our
technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our

party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.    <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in
significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to
continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our
operations.    We require highly skilled personnel to operate
and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain
qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.    <FONT

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe
weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
