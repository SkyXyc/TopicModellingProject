Item 1A: Risk Factors.” Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of those risks as you read this report.4Table of Contents        PART I ITEM 1.  OUR BUSINESS Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group, the Company, our, we or us) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and has two principal subsidiaries: Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon), which provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.  During 2011, we provided air service to more than 24 million passengers and flew to more than 100 destinations.  The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive.  To set ourselves apart we have focused on outstanding operational performance and customer service as evidenced by being ranked “Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers” by J.D. Power and Associates for four consecutive years.  We believe we differentiate ourselves in a number of ways.First, we offer an award-winning frequent flyer program, the Alaska Airlines Mileage PlanTM.  Members can earn and redeem miles on Alaska, Horizon, and a network of 15 airline partners around the globe, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines in the U.S.  Our Mileage Plan has earned recognition as the "Frequent Flyer Program of the Year" five times in the Freddie Awards.  In addition, our Mileage Plan Visa card has been named “Best Loyalty Credit Card in the Americas” for two years running.Second, we are recognized as having industry-leading on-time performance and other key operational metrics.  We are the only airline in the country with a Baggage Service Guarantee and recently launched new mobile applications for Android and iPhone smart phones that provide customers with new functionality aimed at making their travel experience more convenient and hassle-free.  Improving the travel experience, particularly in the airport environment, is an area we will continue to focus on in 2012.Third, we aim to provide a high quality onboard experience to our passengers.  For example, we equipped our fleet of 737 aircraft with onboard Wi-Fi capability.  With 98 percent of the fleet equipped, Alaska is an industry leader in this area.  The Company also continues to focus on serving high-quality food and beverage products on board, using local products from the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.  Our Northern Bites meals-for-purchase program had record sales in 2011, and on February 1, 2012 we introduced Starbucks coffee on on Alaska Flights.  Starbucks has been featured on Horizon flights for many years.  Additionally, Alaska recently took delivery of its first new 737 featuring the Boeing Dreamliner-inspired Sky Interior.  All future deliveries will include this new interior.Fourth, we want to be known for our environmental leadership.  In the fall of 2011, our airlines were the first U.S. carriers to operate multiple scheduled biofuel flights.  We flew over 75 commercial flights between Seattle - Washington D.C. and Seattle - Portland using a 20 percent aviation biofuel blend, refined from used cooking oil.  These routes were selected to demonstrate the use of biofuel on a transcontinental route on a Boeing 737 and a short-haul operation using the Bombardier Q400.  Our inflight recycling programs divert an estimated 800 tons of mixed recyclables from local landfills each year.  In 2011, Horizon flight attendants collected and diverted 90 percent of all recyclable materials, with Alaska  flight crews setting a goal to divert 70 percent of all recyclable materials in 2012.  Further, we are spearheading a "Greener Skies" initiative to implement GPS technology which will allow airlines to use more efficient and environmentally-friendly flight paths, resulting in improved flight procedures and reduced emissions. And finally, we are striving to establish more direct relationships with our customers by engaging them whenever possible at alaskaair.com.  Our completely re-designed website introduced in 2011 is now among the industry's fastest and is better equipped to offer a full range of travel products and services to our customers.  Our focus is to drive more visitors to the site through enhanced online search efforts, email marketing, an expanded social media presence and other digital marketing efforts.  As a result, alaskaair.com's share of total bookings is now over 50 percent.Although Alaska and Horizon both operate as airlines, their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially.  Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937.  Horizon Air Industries is a Washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981.  Horizon was acquired by Air Group in 1986.  Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights.  Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA).  The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying.  Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. 5Table of Contents        Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon's business model changed such that 100% of its capacity is sold to Alaska under the Horizon CPA.  As is typical for similar arrangements, certain costs such as landing fees, selling and distribution costs, and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by Horizon are now recorded by Alaska.  Because of this change, Horizon's revenues and expenses and Alaska's Regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a year-over-year basis. FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF BEING RANKED “HIGHEST IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AMONG TRADITIONAL NETWORK CARRIERS” BY J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES MAINLINE We offer extensive north/south service within the western U.S., Canada and Mexico, and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of Alaska.  We also provide long-haul east/west service to Hawaii and thirteen cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S., primarily from Seattle, where we have our largest concentration of departures; although we do offer long-haul departures from other cities as well. In 2011, we carried nearly 18 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations, and we carry more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland than any other airline.  Based on the number of passengers carried in 2011, Alaska’s leading airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Anchorage and Portland.  Based on 2011 revenues, the leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles, and Seattle-Las Vegas.  At December 31, 2011, Alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 117 Boeing 737 jet aircraft, compared to 114 aircraft as of December 31, 2010.The percentage of mainline passenger traffic by market is presented below: 2011 2010 2009West Coast31% 33% 36%Within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland17% 19% 21%Transcon/midcon22% 24% 23%Hawaii19% 14% 9%Mexico9% 8% 9%Canada2% 2% 2%Total100% 100% 100%      Average Stage Length1,114 1,085 1,034REGIONAL In 2011, our regional operations carried nearly 7 million revenue passengers, primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California.  Horizon is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest and represented 87%, 98%, and 98%, of Air Group's regional revenue passengers during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Based on 2011 passenger enplanements on regional aircraft, the leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Spokane, and Boise.  Based on revenues in 2011, the leading nonstop routes are Portland-Seattle, Spokane-Seattle, and Seattle-Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  At December 31, 2011, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 48 Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. Horizon flights are listed under Alaska's designator code in airline reservation systems, and in most other customer-facing locations. 6Table of Contents        The percentage of regional passenger traffic by market is presented below: 2011 2010 2009West Coast67% 70% 70%Pacific Northwest21% 19% 20%Canada8% 8% 7%Within Alaska2% 2% 2%Mexico2% 1% 1%Total100% 100% 100%      Average Stage Length309 333 327 AIR GROUP CAPACITYWe attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in a way that best optimizes our revenues and profitability, reduces our seasonality, and takes advantage of demand in areas where other carriers have either exited or don't have the ability to serve.The percentage of our capacity by market is as follows: 2011 2010 2009West Coast37% 41% 45%Alaska18% 19% 20%Transcon/midcon19% 19% 17%Hawaii16% 11% 7%Mexico9% 8% 8%Canada1% 2% 3%Total100% 100% 100%INDUSTRY CONDITIONS, COMPETITION, AND ALLIANCES GENERALThe airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit margins subject to various uncertainties.  This includes general economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, intense competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation, and potential aircraft incidents.  Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership, and facilities rents.  Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results.  In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results.  Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity.YEAR IN REVIEW — 2011 2011 was characterized by continued industry capacity discipline with an increase in passenger traffic.  This allowed for higher load factors and yields, leading others in the industry to report higher revenue and in some cases, stronger adjusted earnings compared to 2010.  Jet fuel prices increased significantly in 2011, and that continues to be an area of concern in 2012.  During 2011, our key initiative was to optimize revenue.  We continued to redeploy capacity to better match demand, resulting in record passenger load factors.  We also worked to lower non-fuel unit costs to better compete with carriers that have lower cost structures.  Along with our continued focus on customer service and our strong operational performance, we reported record adjusted financial results that again were among the best in the industry.7Table of Contents        OUR ABILITY TO REDEPLOY CAPACITY, COMBINED WITH LOWER NON-FUEL UNIT COSTS, OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND OUR INDUSTRY LEADING ON-TIME PERFORMANCE RESULTED IN 2011 RECORD ADJUSTED FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT WERE AGAIN AMONG THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY. FUELOur business and financial results are highly affected by the price and, potentially, the availability of jet fuel.  Fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years and are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil as well as the West Coast refining margin, which represent the price of refining crude oil into jet fuel and can vary by region in the U.S.  The price of crude oil spiked in 2008 with a high of nearly $150 per barrel in July 2008 and dropped significantly to an average of $62 per barrel in 2009.  We saw upward pressure on fuel prices again with an average crude oil price of just over $80 per barrel in 2010 and $95 per barrel in 2011.  For us, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately $9 million of additional fuel cost annually.  Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $4 million per year.While West Coast refining margins are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel than crude oil, they also contributed to the overall price volatility in recent years.  Refining margin prices reached a high of nearly $45 per barrel in May 2008, before they dropped to an average price of $24 per barrel in 2009.  Refining margins prices dropped further in 2010 to average $14 a barrel, but then jumped upwards in 2011 and averaged $33 a barrel for the year.  Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast, putting our airlines at a slight competitive disadvantage.We refer to the price we pay for fuel at the airport, including applicable taxes, as our “raw” fuel price.  Historically, fuel costs have generally represented 10% to 15% of an airline’s operating costs, but due to volatility in prices over the past few years, fuel costs have been in the range of 30% to 50% of total operating costs.  Both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control, and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results.Our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 36% in 2011, 27% in 2010, and declined 43% in 2009. We use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices.  Both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption.  With the call option contracts, we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.  The swap contracts do not require an upfront premium, but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period.OUR AIRCRAFT ARE AMONG THE MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CLASSES.We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices.  Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet.  Horizon completed its transition to an all-Q400 turboprop fleet in 2011.  Because of these changes, Alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved from 65.9 ASMs/g in 2006 to 76.6 ASMs/g in 2011.  Similarly, Horizon’s fuel burn has improved from 51.7 ASMs/g in 2006 to 59.3 ASMs/g in 2011.These reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit.COMPETITIONCompetition in the airline industry is intense.  We believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are: •safety record and reputation, •fares, •flight schedules, 8Table of Contents        •customer service, •routes served, •frequent flier programs, •on-time arrivals, •baggage handling, •on-board amenities, •type of aircraft, and •codesharing relationships. We carry approximately 4% of all U.S. domestic passenger traffic.  We compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes, including both major legacy carriers and low-cost carriers.Due to its short-haul markets, our regional operations also competes with ground transportation in many markets, including train, bus and automobile transportation.  Both carriers, to some extent, also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency of face-to-face business meetings.ALLIANCES WITH OTHER AIRLINESWe have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as codesharing on certain flights as shown in the table below.  Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by: •offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities;•giving our Mileage Plan program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from two major global alliances (Oneworld and Skyteam); •giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and •providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs. Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sell codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk.  Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and at any time, one or more may be in the process of renegotiation.9Table of Contents        Our marketing alliances with other airlines are as follows: FrequentFlyerAgreement Codeshare —Alaska Flight # on Flights Operated by Other Airline Codeshare —Other Airline Flight # on Flights Operated byAlaska / Horizon / SkyWestMajor U.S. or International Airlines     American Airlines/American EagleYes Yes YesAir FranceYes No YesBritish AirwaysYes No NoCathay Pacific AirwaysYes No YesDelta Air Lines (a)Yes Yes YesEmirates AirlineYes No NoIcelandairYes No YesKLMYes No YesKorean AirYes No YesLan S.A.Yes No YesAir Pacific (b)Yes No YesQantasYes No YesRegional Airlines     SkyWest (b)Yes Yes NoEra AlaskaYes Yes NoPenAir (b)Yes Yes NoKenmore Air (b)Yes No No(a) Alaska has codeshare agreements with the Delta Connection carriers SkyWest, ASA, Pinnacle, Mesaba, Comair and Compass as part of its agreement with Delta.  (b) These airlines do not have their own frequent flyer program.  However, Alaska’s Mileage Plan members can earn and redeem miles on these airlines’ route systems.TICKET DISTRIBUTION Airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels: •Alaskaair.com:  It is less expensive for us to sell through this direct channel and, as a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website.  In addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly. •Traditional and online travel agencies:  Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS), such as Sabre, to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines.  Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline.  Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies.  Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs. •Reservation call centers:  These call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID.  We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through these call centers.Our sales by channel are as follows:  2011 2010Alaskaair.com51% 48%Traditional agencies28% 28%Online travel agencies13% 15%Reservation call centers8% 9%Total100% 100%10Table of Contents        SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORSOur results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic.  It typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska.  However, we have taken steps over the past few years to reduce the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations in Hawaii and Mexico.In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include:  •general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand,•      pricing initiatives by us and our competitors, •changes in fuel costs, •the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures (both planned and unplanned), •increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs, and •labor actions. In addition to those factors listed above, seasonal variations in traffic, the timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter.  Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers.  Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions (particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest) than some of our competitors, who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems.No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.EMPLOYEES Labor costs have historically made up 30% to 40% of an airline’s total operating costs.  Most major airlines, including ours, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition.  New entrants into the U.S. airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces, which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines.We had 12,806 (9,640 at Alaska and 3,166 at Horizon) active full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 2011, compared to 12,039 (9,013 at Alaska and 3,202 at Horizon) at December 31, 2010.  Wages, salaries and benefits (including variable incentive pay) represented approximately 41% and 43% of our total non-fuel operating expenses and 27% and 31% of our total expenses in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, labor unions represented 83% of Alaska’s and 47% of Horizon’s employees.  Our relations with our U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date.  If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement.  After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.11Table of Contents        Alaska’s union contracts at December 31, 2011 were as follows:Union Employee Group Number ofActive Employees Contract StatusAir Line Pilots Association International (ALPA) Pilots 1,393 Amendable 4/1/2013Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) Flight attendants 2,794 In NegotiationsInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Ramp service and stock clerks 700 Amendable 7/17/2012IAM Clerical, office and passenger service 2,328 Amendable 1/1/2014Aircraft Mechanics FraternalAssociation (AMFA) Mechanics, inspectors and cleaners 626 Amendable 10/17/2016Mexico Workers Association of Air Transport Mexico airport personnel 92 Amendable 9/1/2013Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) Dispatchers 36 Amendable 3/24/2015 Horizon’s union contracts at December 31, 2011 were as follows:Union Employee Group Number ofActive Employees Contract StatusInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Pilots 590 Amendable 12/14/2015AFA Flight attendants 504 In NegotiationsIBT Mechanics and related classifications 327 Amendable 12/16/2014TWU Dispatchers 18 Amendable 8/26/2014National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Station personnel in Van-couver and Victoria, BC, Canada 59 Expires 2/13/2013EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The executive officers of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and executive officers of Alaska and Horizon who have significant decision-making responsibilities, their positions and their respective ages are as follows: Name Position Age Air Groupor SubsidiaryOfficer SinceWilliam Ayer Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alaska Air Group, Inc., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. 57 1985       Brandon Pedersen Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. 45 2003       Keith Loveless Vice President/Legal and Corporate Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. 55 1996       Bradley Tilden President of Alaska Airlines, Inc. 51 1994       Glenn Johnson President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. 53 1991       Benito Minicucci Executive Vice President/Operations and Chief Operating Officer of Alaska Airlines, Inc. 45 2004       Kelley Dobbs Vice President/Human Resources of Alaska Airlines, Inc. 45 2004 Mr. Ayer has been Air Group's President since February 2003 and became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in May 2003.

She is a member of Air Group’s Management Executive Committee.REGULATION GENERAL The airline industry is highly regulated.The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. •DOT:  In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT.  Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates.  In addition, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, and carrier liability for personal or property damage.  International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights.  The DOT has recently been active in implementing a variety of “passenger protection” 13Table of Contents        regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response.  As of January 26, 2012, carriers must adhere to DOT’s full-fare advertising rule, which requires quoted fares to include all applicable government taxes and fees.•FAA:  The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards.  Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA.  Pursuant to these regulations we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate.  The maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls.  From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs.  At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.•TSA:  Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations.  Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations.  We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.  Under TSA authority, we are also required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security measures.  Carriers  also pay the TSA a security infrastructure fee to cover passenger and property screening costs.  These security infrastructure fees amounted to $12.6 million each year in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.  The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.  Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.  To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies.AIRLINE FARES Airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition.  International fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries.  U.S. federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund Act.  We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations.  In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes.  Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations.  We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.It is expected that there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.  Alaska and Horizon have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets, thereby greatly reducing our total emissions.The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system.  Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews.  We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions. Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.14Table of Contents        CUSTOMER SERVICE Along with other domestic airlines, we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, goals relating to lowest fare availability, delays, cancellations and diversions, baggage delivery and liability, guaranteed fares and ticket refunds.  As a testament to our service, Alaska has won the JD Power and Associates award for "Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Network Carriers" for the past four years.INSURANCEWe carry Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft, spare parts and spare engines, as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties.  Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, this insurance program excludes coverage for War and Allied Perils, including hijacking, terrorism, malicious acts, strikes, riots, civil commotion and other identified perils.  So, like other airlines, the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the U.S. government.We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance.WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available on our website at www.alaskaair.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing of these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The information contained on our website is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS If any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.  In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline.  We operate in a continually changing business environment.  In this environment, new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence.  Management cannot predict such developments, nor can it assess the impact, if any, on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forward-looking statements. We have adopted an enterprise wide Risk Analysis and Oversight Program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives within management ranks as well as align these risks with appropriate Board level oversight.  These enterprise level identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below.SAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCEOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident. An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public.  We could experience significant claims from injured passengers, by-standers and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service.  We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers.  However, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident.  Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results.  Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, which would harm our business.Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions. Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant compliance costs.  In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the U.S. DOT, the TSA and the FAA have 15Table of Contents        issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and consumer protections.  Similarly, many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11, 2001, many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers.  Additional laws, regulations, taxes, and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel.  Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “pass-through” costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business.The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry, including our company.  Additional terrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the U.S. could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry, including us, and could: •significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel; •significantly increase security and insurance costs; •make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive; •increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices; •increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats; and •result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA. The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party vendors for certain critical activities. We have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, ground handling, fueling, computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance.  As part of our cost-reduction efforts, our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future.  In recent years, Alaska and Horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance, fleet service, facilities maintenance, and ground handling services at certain airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to outside vendors. Our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks.  In the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all.  If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs, delays, maintenance issues, safety issues or negative public perception of our airline.  Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms.  These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure.Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including delays, cancellations, and other conditions, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Like other airlines, our operations often are affected by delays, cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control.Other conditions that might impact our operations include: •air traffic congestion at airports or other air traffic control problems; •adverse weather conditions;16Table of Contents         •increased security measures or breaches in security; •international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity; and•other changes in business conditions.Due to our geographic area of operations, we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors.  A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the above-mentioned factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.STRATEGYThe airline industry is highly competitive.  If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.We face significant competition with respect to routes, services, and fares.  Some of our competitors have lower costs than we do and provide service to destinations served by us.  We continue to strive toward aggressive cost-reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital.  If we are unable to reduce our costs over the long-term and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital, we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer.We depend on a few key markets to be successful. Our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets, including Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Hawaii and Anchorage.  A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle hub.  In 2011, passengers to and from Seattle accounted for 63% of our total passengers.We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft, and ground facilities, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions.  As a result, we remain highly dependent on our key markets.  Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets.  An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations. The recent U.S. and global economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel.  While some economic indicators are showing signs of growth, unemployment remains high in some of our key markets.  Given that the strength of the U.S. and global economies have an impact on the demand for air travel, a long-term economic slump could result in a need to adjust our capacity plans, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts. Alaska is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts.  Horizon is similarly dependent on Bombardier.  Additionally, each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines.  As a result, we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements. Alaska and Horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers, or “partners," including, but not limited to, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.  These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights.  In addition, the agreements generally provide that members of Alaska’s Mileage Plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa.  We receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements.  In addition, we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our Mileage Plan 17Table of Contents        program.  The loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights through bankruptcy, consolidation, or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan, which we believe is a source of competitive advantage.In November 2011, AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection.  We do not believe the bankruptcy will impact our marketing agreement with American Airlines.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business, and a failure or disruption of these systems or their operators could harm our business. We depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our airline reservation system, our telecommunication systems, our website, our maintenance systems, our check-in kiosks, and other systems.  Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks.  We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets.  In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website, reservation system, and check-in systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information, and deliver important flight information.  Substantial or repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline.  In addition, we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling, flight dispatch, and other operational needs.  Disruptions, untimely recovery, or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data, an increase of our expenses, an impact on our operational performance, or a possible temporary cessation of our operations.If we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our customers.  In addition, our online operations at alaskaair.com depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including credit card information.  A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our customers’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial position and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.  In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business partners is regulated at the international, federal and state levels.  Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETSOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses, accounting for 34% and 27% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations.Future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations, unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs.Our continuing obligation to fund our traditional defined-benefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.Our defined-benefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk.  If market returns are poor in the future, any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity.  Poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations.  The calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “Critical Accounting Estimates”  and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.18Table of Contents        Our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints. Although we have reduced our long-term debt balance significantly over the past three years, we have, and may continue to have for the foreseeable future, a significant amount of debt.  Due to our high fixed costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings. Our outstanding long-term debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences.  For example, they could: •limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital or other purposes; •require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; and•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including reacting to the current economic slowdown.Although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due, we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future.  If we fail to do so, our business could be harmed. Alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements.  We cannot be certain that Alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs.See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments.Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry.  Furthermore, the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through September 30, 2013.  Although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage, we cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or if it does, for how long the extension will last.  It is expected that, should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry, the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited, including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods.  Significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.BRAND AND REPUTATIONWe may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may negatively impact our brand and  reputation.  We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand perception to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers.  These efforts include significant improvements to our airport space at Los Angeles International Airport(LAX) and efforts to increase our direct customer relationships through improvements to our online purchasing portal (alaskaair.com), social media, and customer loyalty programs (Club 49).   If these efforts are unsuccessful or they negatively affect our reputation with our existing customer base, we may experience an adverse impact on our business and financial results.  Furthermore, with the ongoing Horizon brand phase-out, there is a potential that we may lose some brand recognition from our customers in areas that Horizon has historically served.19Table of Contents        LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGYA significant increase in labor costs, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees, or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses, accounting for approximately 27% and 31% of our total operating expenses in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement, and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them.As of December 31, 2011, labor unions represented approximately 83% of Alaska’s and 47% of Horizon’s employees.  Although we have been successful in maturing communications, negotiating approaches, and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the Company's long-term vision, future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction, affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues.We compete against the major U.S. airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions.  If we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost, sustain employee engagement in the Company's strategic vision, or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff, we may be unable to grow or sustain our business.  In such case, our operating results and business prospects could be harmed. ITEM 1B
