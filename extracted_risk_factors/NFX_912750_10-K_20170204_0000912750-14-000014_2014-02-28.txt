, “Risk Factors,” of this report. Our estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves and future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, as well as changes in proved reserves during the last three years, are contained in “Supplementary Financial Information — Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of this report.The following table shows by country and in the aggregate a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2013.

Our year-end 2013 proved reserves of 612 MMBOE increased 8% compared to our proved reserves at year-end 2012. Our reserves consisted of 282 MMBOE proved developed producing, 55 MMBOE proved developed non-producing and 275 MMBOE proved undeveloped reserves. Our proved liquids reserves at year-end 2013 were 338 million barrels, compared to 274 million barrels at year-end 2012, an increase of 23%. During 2013, oil and condensate reserves increased 33 million barrels and NGL reserves increased 31 million barrels. At year-end 2013, 80% of our proved liquids reserves were crude oil or condensate. At December 31, 2013, our proved natural gas reserves were 1,648 Bcf which represented a decrease of 6% compared to 2012.During 2013, we added 80 MMBOE through discoveries, extensions and other additions. Consistent with our continued focus on domestic liquids, our 2013 additions were 98% domestic and 61% were liquids, which was 27 million barrels of oil and 22 million barrels of NGLs. Through infill drilling revisions, we added 75 MMBOE. At December 31, 2013, the SEC pricing for natural gas was $3.67 per MMBtu, a 33% increase compared to the prior year-end. As a result, we revised our total proved reserves upward by 10 MMBOE. However, consistent with our domestic liquids focus we removed 294 Bcf of natural gas reserves because we do not expect to drill them within the next five years. During 2013, we had a negative 24 MMBOE performance revision, 90% of the revision was in natural gas and primarily associated with the Uinta Basin.  Proved Undeveloped Reserves.    Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013 were 275 MMBOE compared to 268 MMBOE at December 31, 2012. Liquids comprised 64% of our total proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2013. During 2013, we invested approximately $0.7 billion of drilling, completion and facilities-related capital to convert 32 MMBOE of our December 31, 2012 proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves. Additionally, we invested approximately $0.1 billion of facilities-related capital for the continued development of our proved undeveloped reserves that were not fully converted to proved developed status as of December 31, 2013. Through infill drilling revisions, we added 41 MMBOE. During 2013, we added 54 MMBOE of new proved undeveloped reserves through discoveries, extensions and other additions, a 1 MMBOE net increase due to sales and acquisitions, and negative revisions of 62 MMBOE primarily driven by increased focus on liquids delaying the development of 49 MMBOE of gas reserves in the next five years.Proved undeveloped reserve quantities are limited by the activity level of development drilling we expect to undertake during the 2014-2018 five-year period. Of the 275 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013, 29 MMBOE is associated with the Greater Monument Butte waterflood and are currently planned to be developed within the next five years, but exceed five years from the date of first booking. The waterflood requires the timely and orderly drilling of production and injection wells, conversion of producing wells to injection wells and the injection of certain amounts of water before all producing wells are drilled to optimize oil recovery and project economics. The scope and scale of this project is such that if it were terminated, for whatever reason, a significant portion of previously invested capital would be lost. For additional information regarding the changes in our proved reserves, see our "Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures" under Item 8 of this report.In the years 2011 through 2013, we developed 19%, 9% and 12%, respectively, of our prior year-end proved undeveloped reserves. The development plans in our year-end reserve report reflect (i) the allocation of capital to projects in the first year of activity based upon the initial budget for such year and (ii) in subsequent years, the capital allocation in our five-year business plan, each of which generally is governed by our expectations for capital investment in such time period. Changes in commodity pricing between the time of preparation of the reserve report and actual investment, investment alternatives that may have been added to our portfolio of assets, changes in the availability and costs of oilfield services, and other economic factors may lead to changes in our development plans. As a result, the future rate at which we develop our proved undeveloped reserves may vary from historical development rates.Reserves SensitivitiesTo determine our year-end 2013 reserve estimates, we utilized SEC pricing for natural gas of $3.67 per MMBtu and crude oil of $96.82 per barrel.Using crude oil prices of $80 and $90 per barrel, the quantity of our domestic proved developed reserves decreases by 1% and 0% respectively, due to shortening of the economic life. Our proved undeveloped liquids reserves are primarily in the Uinta Basin of Utah, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. At crude oil prices of $80 per barrel, and without a commensurate change in cost, our domestic proved undeveloped reserves would decrease by approximately 9 MMBOE, and we would reduce our future capital investment by a total of approximately $250 million during the next five years. As a result of the foregoing, at $80 per barrel our domestic proved reserves would decrease by 2%.Our planned capital activity focuses on liquids versus natural gas and is limited by the level of development drilling we expect to undertake in the future. At natural gas prices below $3.00 per MMBtu, our domestic proved developed reserves 9would decrease by 2% due to shortening the economic life. In line with our liquids focus, at the lower gas prices our undeveloped reserves remain materially unchanged. At higher natural gas prices of $4.00 and $5.00 per MMBtu, and without reconfiguring to optimize our development plan, the pre-tax present value of our proved reserves would increase by $223 million and $902 million, respectively.Under the terms of our production sharing contracts (PSC) in Malaysia and China, an increase or decrease in realized oil prices would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our proved reserves. At higher oil prices, lesser quantities of oil are required for cost recovery and at lower oil prices, greater quantities of oil are required for cost recovery. Our share (the contractor’s share) of future production is impacted accordingly. The effect of higher or lower oil prices may be partially offset by extending or shortening, respectively, the economic life of proved reserves.Drilling ActivityThe following table sets forth the number of oil and gas wells that completed drilling for each of the last three years.   2013 2012 2011  Gross   Net   Gross   Net   Gross   Net  Exploratory wells:            Domestic:            Productive(1) 198 95.2 190 90.5 263 159.2Nonproductive(2) 1 1.0 2 2.0 2 1.0International:(3)            China:            Nonproductive 1 1.0 — — 1 1.0Malaysia:            Productive(4) 2 1.1 — — 1 0.7Nonproductive — — 2 0.9 — —International Total:            Productive 2 1.1 — — 1 0.7Nonproductive 1 1.0 2 0.9 1 1.0Exploratory well total 202 98.3 194 93.4 267 161.9Development wells:            Domestic:            Productive 276 217.1 214 170.9 253 199.6International:(3)            China:            Productive 3 0.3 — — — —Malaysia:            Productive 12 7.5 12 7.7 17 5.8International Total:            Productive 15 7.8 12 7.7 17 5.8Development well total 291 224.9 226 178.6 270 205.4 _________________(1)Includes 170 gross (78.6 net) wells in 2013, 161 gross (64.2 net) wells in 2012 and 202 gross (121.6 net) wells in 2011 that are exploitation wells.(2)The 2013 and 2011 wells are exploitation wells.(3)Classified as discontinued operations.(4)The 2013 wells are exploitation wells.We were in the process of drilling 16 gross (13.1 net) development wells domestically at December 31, 2013. Internationally, we were drilling 1 gross (0.4 net) exploitation well in Malaysia at December 31, 2013.10Productive WellsAs of December 31, 2013, we had the following productive oil and gas wells, including 12 gross (5 net) oil wells with multiple completions.

The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs or contracts for field personnel and performs other functions. Generally, an operator receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per-well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates established by the various operating agreements or contracts. The charges customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated.Acreage DataThe following two tables list by geographic area interests we owned in developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage at December 31, 2013, along with a summary by year of our undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years. In most cases, the drilling of a commercial well, or the filing and approval of a development plan or suspension of operations will hold the acreage beyond the expiration date. Domestic ownership interests are onshore and generally take the form of “working interests” in oil and gas leases that have varying terms. International ownership interests, which are now classified as discontinued operations, are offshore and generally arise from participation in PSCs. 11Total Acreage  Developed Acres Undeveloped Acres  Gross Net Gross Net  (In thousands)Domestic:        Mid-Continent 601 325 259 189Rocky Mountains 284 196 783 588Onshore Gulf Coast 310 230 58 39Total Domestic 1,195 751 1,100 816International:         China 34 9 — —Malaysia 202 104 3,399 1,234Total International 236 113 3,399 1,234Total 1,431 864 4,499 2,050Expiring Acreage   Undeveloped Acres Expiring  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net  (In thousands)Domestic:                    Mid-Continent 58 22 47 32 63 48 6 5 — —Rocky Mountains 44 23 325 276 81 41 70 66 6 6Onshore Gulf Coast 20 13 15 14 1 — 1 1 — —Total Domestic 122 58 387 322 145 89 77 72 6 6International:                    Offshore Malaysia 1,586 593 1,813 641 — — — — — —Total International 1,586 593 1,813 641 — — — — — —Total 1,708 651 2,200 963 145 89 77 72 6 6 At December 31, 2013, we owned fee mineral interests in 441,827 gross (85,605 net) acres. These interests do not expire.Title to PropertiesWe believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases or capital commitments under PSCs or exploration licenses. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, often limited investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.MarketingSubstantially all of our oil, gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices to a variety of purchasers, primarily under short-term contracts (less than 12 months). We also have long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin at market-based prices. For a list of purchasers of our production that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for the three preceding calendar years, please see Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Major Customers,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which information is incorporated herein by reference. We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are readily available with the exception of purchasers of our Uinta Basin oil production.12Due to the paraffin content of our Uinta Basin production, there is limited access to refining capacity outside of the Salt Lake City area at this time. In late 2011 and early 2012, we signed two separate long-term agreements (7 and 10 years, respectively) for a combined 38,000 BOPD of refining capacity in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. These agreements are expected to add approximately 20,000 BOPD of “new” refinery capacity in the region. Specifically, in December 2011, we executed a crude oil supply agreement with Tesoro Corporation to provide 18,000 BOPD of supply capacity at Tesoro’s refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah. This agreement, which spans a seven-year period, commenced in mid-2013 and increases to 18,000 BOPD over the next year. In addition, in January 2012, we executed a crude oil supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation to provide approximately 20,000 BOPD of supply capacity at HollyFrontier’s Woods Cross, Utah refinery. This agreement spans a 10-year period, with limited commitments expected to commence upon the refiner completing the expansion of their facility, which is expected in late 2015, and increases to 20,000 BOPD during the following year. We continue to seek additional capacity to accommodate our growth plans for the Uinta Basin, including the use of rail and pipelines to access new markets outside of the Salt Lake City area. Please see the discussion under “There is limited transportation and refining capacity for our black and yellow wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production in the Uinta Basin” in  of this report, which information is incorporated herein by reference.Segment InformationOur continuing operations are comprised of a single business segment, the domestic exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Prior to classifying our international businesses as held-for-sale and discontinued operations, we reported business segments for Malaysia and China.EmployeesAs of February 24, 2014, we had 1,548 employees. All but 68 of our employees were located in the United States. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relationships with our employees are satisfactory.RegulationExploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local, foreign and international regulations. An overview of these regulations is set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen resource or environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption “We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business,” in , "Risk Factors," which information is incorporated herein by reference.Commonly Used Oil and Gas TermsBelow are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business and in this report.Barrel or Bbl.

Exploitation wells in those areas have less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine exploitation and development activities.Exploration well.    An exploration well is a well drilled to find a new field or new reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from exploration activities.FERC.    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Field.

The SEC provides a complete definition of probable reserves in Rule 4-10(a)(18) of Regulation S-X.Productive well.    A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes.19Proved developed reserves.    In general, proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The SEC provides a complete definition of developed oil and gas reserves in Rule 4-10(a)(6) of Regulation S-X.Proved reserves.    Those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations — prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.Proved undeveloped reserves.    In general, proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The SEC provides a complete definition of undeveloped oil and gas reserves in Rule 4-10(a)(31) of Regulation S-X.Reserve life index.    This index is calculated by dividing total proved reserves on an equivalent basis at year-end by annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining production.Tcfe.

The SEC provides a complete definition of prices in “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” (Final Rule).Unconventional resource plays.    Plays targeting tight sand, coal bed or shale reservoirs. The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require horizontal drilling and stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economically.Undeveloped acreage.    Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.Working interest.    The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.WTI.    West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil.20Item 1A.     Risk FactorsThere are many factors that may affect Newfield’s business and results of operations. Described below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider, in addition to the other information contained in this report, the risks described below.Oil, gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business.    Our revenues, profitability and future growth, as well as liquidity and ability to access additional sources of capital, depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, gas and NGLs. Lower prices may reduce the amount of oil, gas and NGLs that we can economically produce. Oil, gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.The markets for oil, gas and NGLs have historically been, and will likely remain, volatile. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control. Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are:•the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and NGLs;•the price and availability of, and demand for, alternative fuels;•weather conditions and climate change;•changes in supply and demand;•world-wide economic conditions;•world-wide conservation measures;•technological advances affecting energy consumption;•the price of foreign imports;•the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation and processing facilities;•the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including commodity price speculators and others;•political conditions in oil and gas producing regions;•the actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations; •the actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and•the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.Significant declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:•limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;•causing us to delay or postpone capital projects;•reducing reserves and the amount of products we can economically produce;•reducing revenues, income and cash flows; or•reducing the carrying value of our assets.We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that we expect to be greater than cash flows from operations. Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan.    We anticipate that our 2014 capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations. We expect to use available capacity 21under our credit arrangements and sell non-strategic assets to fund the shortfall. Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas and oil, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:•we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital;•one or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us;•the amount that we are allowed to borrow under our existing credit facility is reduced; or•our customers or working interest owners default on their obligations to us.Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates.    Estimating accumulations of oil, gas and NGLs is complex. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:•the quality and quantity of available data;•the interpretation of that data;•the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and•the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on our prepared estimates. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates.Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates. In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors. Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator’s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities and prevailing oil, gas and NGL prices. Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on SEC 12-month pricing, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year-end discounted at 10%. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used. In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves.    Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline. Future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our success in efficiently finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable. We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments.    We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value 22of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This is called a “ceiling test writedown.” We evaluate the ceiling test quarterly and recorded a ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million after-tax) at December 31, 2012. We did not have a ceiling test writedown in 2013. Although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flows from operations, it does reduce our stockholders’ equity and could negatively impact certain debt covenants. Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.We may experience further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the future. The risk that we will be required to further writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. Any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.Drilling is a high-risk activity.    In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:•costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and materials;•adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;•unexpected drilling conditions;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;•equipment failures or accidents;•lack of necessary services or qualified personnel;•availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses;•availability, costs and terms of contractual arrangements, such as leases, pipelines and related facilities to gather, process and compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; and•compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.    Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:•fires and explosions;•blow-outs;•uncontrollable or unknown flows of oil, gas or well fluids;•formations with abnormal pressures;•pipe or cement failures and casing collapses;•pipeline ruptures;•adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;•discharges of toxic gases;•buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;•vandalism; and23•environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:•injury or loss of life;•severe damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil and gas reservoirs;•pollution and other environmental damage;•investigatory and clean-up responsibilities;•regulatory investigation and penalties or lawsuits;•limitation on or suspension of our operations; and•repairs to resume operations.Further, offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoon or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. Our international operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own. Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors and subcontractors and any property damage suffered by the contractors. There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue and the funds available to us for our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “— We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.”We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business.    Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business. Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption “Regulation” in Items 1 and 2 of this report: •the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;•response to unexpected releases into the environment;•reports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production and other operations;•the placement and spacing of wells;24•unitization and pooling of properties;•calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and state leases; and•taxation.Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental damages. We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures, engage in environmental risk management and hedging activities or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Further, changes to existing environmental regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us, the oil and gas industry generally, our suppliers or our customers. For example, governments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner. In the absence of dedicated federal legislation on climate change mitigation or adaptation, the EPA has promulgated several rulemakings to regulate, measure or monitor GHG emissions under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, or CAA. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, as well as from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities on an annual basis. The new regulations could impact certain facilities in which we have interests (legal, equitable, operated or non-operated) by increasing regulatory risks and reporting requirements.In December 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” under the CAA concluding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere from motor vehicles threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding, once made, required the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions from new cars and light trucks under the CAA. Indirectly, the EPA argued that it also triggered an EPA obligation to regulate GHG emissions under existing relevant air permitting programs for large stationary sources. On January 2, 2011, the EPA initiated Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting requirements for carbon dioxide and other GHGs from large and modified stationary sources. Permits limiting GHGs have been issued for a variety of new or modified facilities under the Clean Air Act PSD program. GHG emissions also trigger Title V operating permit requirements for new and existing sources that exceed certain established emission thresholds. The PSD permitting requirement is triggered when a new or modified facility emits specified levels of GHGs (e.g., 75,000-100,000 tons per year). Emission levels in excess of these thresholds can then trigger preconstruction permit requirements and application of best available control technology (BACT) as determined on a source-by-source basis. In most cases, based on cost, the BACT compliance option selected for GHGs is increased energy efficiency.If the U.S. Congress adopts market-based tax, energy or other  mechanisms to regulate the carbon intensity of natural resources, or promote or require the reduction of GHG emissions from certain industrial sectors, such legislation, depending on design and scope, could increase the cost of oil and gas production and market demand. Some states, like California, have implemented state-wide GHG mitigation programs to reduce GHG emissions through a mixture of regulatory programs, including a low carbon fuel standard and cap-and-trade market applicable to, among others, electric utilities and transportation fuels.Further, the U.S. Congress has previously proposed legislation that would directly impact our industry. In response to the 2010 Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Congress was considering a number of legislative proposals relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore that could result in significant additional laws or regulations governing our operations in the United States, including a proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on liability for oil spill cleanups under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.These and other potential regulations, if introduced and passed in Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also “— The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.”Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. Additional costs or operating 25restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce.The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.    Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements. Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the RCT and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process, and the RCT adopted rules regarding the same in December 2011. On September 11, 2012, the RCT approved new regulations relating to the commercial recycling of produced water and/or hydraulic-fracturing flowback fluid, and on December 17, 2012, proposed revised amendments to rules of casing, cementing, well control and completion of oil and gas wells.In the past three years, news reports indicate that around two dozen states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.Notwithstanding state regulatory requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing, there are steps by federal governmental agencies that are either underway or are being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and recently released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel. Further, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. In addition, in May 2013, the BLM issued a proposed rule that would require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, set requirements for well-bore integrity and establish flowback water standards for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal public lands and American Indian Tribal lands. The proposed rule also required that an operator certify, in writing, that (a) the stimulation design complies with all federal, state, tribal and local regulations; (b) the stimulation was completed in accordance with the design approved by BLM and all applicable regulations; and (c) the well-bore integrity was maintained during the fracturing process and flowback water was properly stored, treated and disposed. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with draft results to be issued in 2014 for public comment and peer review. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. In a November 18, 2011 report, the Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board issued 20 recommendations to federal agencies, states and private entities that are intended to reduce the environmental impact and assure the safety of shale gas production.Given the heightened awareness regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that regulatory agencies or private parties may suggest that hydraulic fracturing has caused groundwater contamination, whether or not such allegations are accurate. For example, on December 8, 2011, the EPA released a preliminary report indicating that hydraulic fracturing is responsible for groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, although the EPA’s draft report has been hotly criticized as ignoring certain facts and utilizing incorrect data. In addition, the EPA has alleged in an enforcement action against an operator in Texas that the operator contaminated local groundwater wells, although the RTC found after an evidentiary hearing that the operator was not responsible for the contamination. However, in 2013 the EPA deferred the Pavillion matter to state oversight and withdrew the emergency action order in Texas. Nevertheless, energy extraction, with a focus on onshore natural gas 26production, remains an EPA enforcement initiative. Thus, regulatory agencies or private parties alleging groundwater contamination linked to hydraulic fracturing could trigger defense costs in administrative or civil litigation to rebut the allegations.Additionally, certain members of the Congress have called upon (a) the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, (b) the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and (c) the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. These on-going or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.Further, on August 16, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA finalized rules under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs. The EPA regulations include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells. Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring using a completion combustion device or by capturing the gas using green completions. After January 1, 2015, operators must capture the gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the regulations under NESHAPS include specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. We are currently evaluating the effect these regulations could have on our business. Compliance with such regulations could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic-fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic-fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions.    We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facility.Our use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.    As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the relevant underlying commodity reference prices and those of our physical pricing points. While the use of hedging arrangements may limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge transactions.The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions. If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts, enter receivership or seek bankruptcy or similar protection, that could result in 27an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes. In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions.    On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Reform Act) was enacted to establish federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and over entities, such as Newfield, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act includes provisions that require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has begun to formally determine the types of swaps that will be subject to the mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end-users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. If our swap activities are not exempt from mandatory clearing or exchange trading, or from margin requirements for uncleared swaps, we could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for those activities. There are substantial costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act that create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield’s swap contracts (including through requirements to post margin or collateral for cleared and uncleared swaps), which could adversely affect our available liquidity, materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities. In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Reform Act to expand aggregate position limits to include swaps that are economically equivalent to certain types of commodity futures, including specified energy commodity futures and related transactions, which could apply to swap transactions in which we engage beyond certain thresholds. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from those limits, and the rules could require additional oversight monitoring and reporting. If the position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on units containing the acreage.    Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expires unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established. If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.    In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, among other proposals:•the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties;•the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs;•the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and•an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.28These proposals were also included in President Obama’s Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Budget. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of such legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. Federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.There is limited transportation and refining capacity for our black and yellow wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production in the Uinta Basin.    Most of the crude oil we produce in the Uinta Basin is known as “black wax” or “yellow wax” because it has higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major North American basins. Due to its wax content, the oil is heated in the field and transported in insulated trucks during shipping. At this time, our transportation options are limited. Substantially all of our production is transported by truck to refiners in the Salt Lake City area. We are exploring the feasibility of transporting future oil volumes by rail or pipeline. We currently have agreements in place with area refiners that secure base load sales of substantially all of our expected production in the Uinta Basin through the end of 2016. In addition, we have executed long-term supply agreements (7 and 10 years) with Tesoro (began in 2013) and HollyFrontier (expected to begin in 2015), who are expanding their local refineries. The inability of Tesoro or HollyFrontier to complete their expansions or an extended loss of any of our largest purchasers or an inability to secure new markets outside of the Salt Lake City area could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of our black and yellow wax crude oil.The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control.    The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. We deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We have risks associated with our non-U.S. operations.    Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations. These risks may include:•currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;•loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection or other changes in government;•increases in taxes and governmental royalties;•forced renegotiation of, unilateral changes to, or termination of contracts with, governmental entities and quasi-governmental agencies;•changes in laws and policies governing operations of non-U.S. based companies;•our limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of non-operated properties;•the operator’s expertise or other labor problems;•cultural differences;•difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and•other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations.29Our international operations may also be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our international operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.Exploration in international deepwater involves significant financial risks, and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable rates.    Much of our international deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and requires substantial capital investment, and it is difficult to estimate the timing of our production. Because of the size of significant projects in which we invest, we may not serve as the operator. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results.    To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals. Competition for these professionals remains strong. We are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals.  Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense.    We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, gas and NGLs. Our competitors include national oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do. In addition, high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties. We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for certain drilling rights if our competitors are seeking the same. Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect financial condition and results of operations.  Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials. Shortages of field personnel, drilling rigs, other equipment or supplies, or price increases, could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.    Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us. See also “— The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.” We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues. We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability and other coverages. Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution and other 30environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers. Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions.    As part of our business strategy, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of properties. However, suitable acquisition properties may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, and acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels. Also, in pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire properties.  The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:•recoverable reserves;•future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials;•operating costs; and•potential environmental and other liabilities.The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems.We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.    We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.    We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.31Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.    Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products. Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers.Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility.    As of December 31, 2013, we had total indebtedness of $3.7 billion, including $0.6 billion in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:•incur additional indebtedness;•purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests or subordinated debt;•make specified investments;•create liens;•sell assets;•engage in specified transactions with affiliates;•engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and•effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.These restrictions could limit our ability to:•obtain future financing;•make needed capital expenditures;•plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•compete with similar companies that have less debt;•withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general; or•conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn. Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations. This failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions, even if sufficient funds were available.Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities. Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet 32our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations.Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our Company.    Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to affect a change of control of our Company, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management. In addition, our change of control severance plan and agreements and our omnibus stock plans contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, upon a change of control. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of our Company.33Item 1B
