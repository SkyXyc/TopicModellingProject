ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.


 


    Consumers has installed and is currently installing modern
    emission controls at its electric generating plants and has
    converted and is converting electric generating units to burn
    cleaner fuels. Consumers expects that the cost of future
    environmental compliance, especially compliance with clean air
    laws, will be significant because of EPA regulations and
    proposed regulations regarding nitrogen oxide,
    particulate-related emissions, and mercury. Consumers will spend
    $835 million through 2015 to comply with the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule and will spend $480 million through 2015 to
    comply with the State of Michigan’s proposed mercury plan.


 


    Consumers completed the closure of an ash landfill at one plant
    in 2007 and is awaiting MDEQ certification of that closure.
    Consumers is also in the process of closing some older areas at
    an ash landfill at another plant. Construction, operation, and
    closure of a modern solid waste disposal area for ash can be
    expensive because of strict federal and state requirements. In
    order to significantly reduce ash field closure costs, Consumers
    has worked with others to use bottom ash and fly ash as part of
    a temporary and final cover for ash disposal areas instead of
    native materials, in cases where such use of bottom ash and fly
    ash is compatible with environmental standards. To reduce
    disposal volumes, Consumers sells coal ash for use as a Portland
    cement replacement in concrete products, as a filler for
    asphalt, as feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement and
    for other environmentally compatible uses. The EPA has announced
    its intention to develop new nationwide standards for ash
    disposal areas. Consumers intends to work through industry
    groups to help ensure that any such regulations require only the
    minimum cost necessary to adhere to standards that are
    consistent with protection of the environment.


 


    Consumers’ electric generating plants must comply with
    rules that significantly reduce the number of fish killed by
    plant cooling water intake systems. Consumers is studying
    options to determine the most cost-effective solutions for
    compliance.


 


    Like most electric utilities, Consumers has PCB in some of its
    electrical equipment. During routine maintenance activities,
    Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout
    and sealant materials at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility.
    Consumers removed and replaced part of the PCB material with
    non-PCB material. Consumers has proposed a plan to the EPA to
    deal with the remaining materials and is waiting for a response
    from the EPA.


 


    Certain environmental regulations affecting CMS Energy and
    Consumers include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act
    Amendments of 1990 and Superfund. Superfund can require any
    individual or entity that may have owned or operated a disposal
    site, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous
    substances that were sent to such a site, to share in
    remediation costs for the site.


 


    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not extend to cover the risks of certain environmental
    cleanup costs or environmental damages, such as claims for air
    pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and
    for some past PCB contamination, and for some long-term storage
    or disposal of pollutants.

    CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION


 



    Electric
    Competition


 


    Consumers’ electric utility business experiences actual and
    potential competition from many sources, both in the wholesale
    and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric
    delivery, and retail services.


 


    Michigan’s Customer Choice Act gives all electric customers
    the right to buy generation service from an alternative electric
    supplier. In January 2006, the MPSC approved cost-based ROA
    distribution tariffs. A significant decrease in retail electric
    competition occurred in 2005 due to changes in market
    conditions, including increased uncertainty and volatility in
    fuel commodity prices. Energy market volatility continued into
    2006. At December 31, 2007, alternative electric suppliers
    were providing 315 MW of generation service to ROA
    customers. This amount represents an increase of 5 percent
    compared to December 31, 2006, and is 4 percent of
    Consumers’ total distribution load. It is difficult to
    predict future ROA customer trends.


 


    In addition to retail electric customer choice, Consumers has
    competition or potential competition from:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;




 



     
        • 

    
    municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;




 



     
        • 

    
    customer self-generation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.





 


    Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and enforcing compliance with MPSC and FERC
    rules, providing non-energy services, and providing tariff-based
    incentives that support economic development.


 


    Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. Consumers faces
    competition from many sources, including energy management
    services companies, other utilities, contractors, and retail
    merchandisers.


 


    CMS ERM, a non-utility electric subsidiary, continues to focus
    on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s independent power production
    business, a non-utility electric subsidiary, faces competition
    from generators, marketers and brokers, as well as other
    utilities marketing power at lower prices on the wholesale
    market.


 


    For additional information concerning electric competition, see
    ITEM 7. CMS ENERGY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS — OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC UTILITY
    BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES and ITEM 7. CONSUMERS’
    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS —
    OUTLOOK — ELECTRIC BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES.


 



    Gas
    Competition


 


    Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business, and is likely to increase. Competition comes
    from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to
    Consumers’ customers and from alternative fuels and energy
    sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.


 



    INSURANCE


 


    CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage similar to comparable companies in the same
    lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms,
    conditions, limitations and exclusions that might not fully
    compensate CMS Energy for all losses. A portion of each loss is
    generally assumed by CMS Energy in the form of deductibles and
    self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As
    CMS Energy renews its policies it is possible that some of the
    current insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

    ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS
    


 


    Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and consolidated
    Consumers could differ materially from historical results and
    the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    The companies’ business is influenced by many factors that
    are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may
    materially affect actual results and are often beyond the
    companies’ control. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known or that the companies’ management currently
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this annual report
    and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be
    carefully considered before making an investment in securities
    of CMS Energy and Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also
    risk factors for CMS Energy.


 



    Risks
    Related to CMS Energy


 



    CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.


 


    Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations.
    Restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock
    provisions and other legal restrictions, such as certain terms
    in its articles of incorporation, limit Consumers’ ability
    to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy. At
    December 31, 2007, Consumers had $269 million of
    unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock
    dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid to CMS Energy by
    its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to generate the
    funds necessary to fulfill its cash obligations, thereby
    adversely affecting its liquidity and financial condition.


 



    CMS
    Energy has substantial indebtedness that could limit its
    financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt
    service obligations.


 


    As of December 31, 2007, CMS Energy had $1.891 billion
    aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including
    $178 million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its
    convertible preferred securities. $4.374 billion of
    subsidiary debt is not included in the preceding total. In April
    2007, CMS Energy entered into the Seventh Amended and Restated
    Credit Agreement providing revolving credit and commitments in
    the amount of $300 million, which was increased to
    $550 million in January 2008. As of December 31, 2007,
    there were $278 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under the Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. CMS
    Energy and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in
    the future.


 


    The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its
    indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;




 



     
        • 

    
    covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it
    to meet certain financial tests, which may affect its
    flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its
    business;




 



     
        • 

    
    its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and
    other purposes may be limited;




 



     
        • 

    
    it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that
    are less leveraged; and




 



     
        • 

    
    its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions
    may increase.





 


    CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other
    factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its
    control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its business
    will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
    to service its indebtedness. If it is unable to generate
    sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be required to
    sell additional assets or obtain additional financing. CMS
    Energy cannot assure that additional financing will be available
    on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

    CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of claims regarding its
    participation in the development of Bay Harbor or other
    litigation in which substantial monetary claims are
    involved.


 


    As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries
    of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement with the MDEQ, third
    parties constructed a golf course and park over several
    abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former cement plant
    operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third parties also
    undertook a series of remedial actions, including removing
    abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating, shaping and
    covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation; removing CKD from
    streams and beaches; and constructing a leachate collection
    system at an identified seep. Leachate is formed when water
    passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay
    Harbor, but retained its obligations under environmental
    indemnifications entered into at the start of the project.


 


    In September 2004, the MDEQ issued a notice of noncompliance
    after finding high-pH leachate in Lake Michigan adjacent to the
    property. The MDEQ also alleged higher than acceptable levels of
    heavy metals, including mercury, in the leachate flow.


 


    In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital executed an
    AOC and approved a Removal Action Work Plan to address problems
    at Bay Harbor. Among other things, the plan called for the
    installation of collection trenches to capture high-pH leachate
    flow to the lake. Collection systems required under the plan
    have been installed and shoreline monitoring is ongoing. CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to address observed
    exceedances in pH, including required enhancements of the
    collection system. In May 2006, the EPA approved a pilot carbon
    dioxide enhancement plan to improve pH results in a specific
    area of the collection system. The enhanced system was installed
    in June 2006. CMS Land and CMS Capital also engaged in other
    enhancements of the installed collection systems.


 


    In November 2007, the EPA sent CMS Land and CMS Capital a letter
    identifying three separate areas representing approximately
    700 feet of shoreline in which the EPA claimed pH levels
    were unacceptable. The letter also took the position that CMS
    Land and CMS Capital are required to remedy the claimed
    noncompliance. CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a formal
    objection to the EPA’s conclusions. In their objections,
    CMS Land and CMS Capital noted that the AOC did not require
    perfection and that over 97 percent of the measured pH
    levels were in the correct range. Further, the limited number of
    exceedances were not much above the pH nine level set by the AOC
    and posed no threat to the public health and safety. In
    addition, CMS Land and CMS Capital noted in their objection that
    the actions they had already taken fully complied with the terms
    of the AOC. In January 2008, the EPA advised CMS Land and CMS
    Capital that it had rejected their objections, and that CMS Land
    and CMS Capital were obligated to submit a plan to augment
    measures to collect high pH leachate under the terms of the
    November 2007 EPA letter as modified in the January 2008 letter.
    CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan
    in February 2008.


 


    In February 2006, CMS Land and CMS Capital submitted to the EPA
    a proposed Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RIFS)
    for one of the CKD piles known as the East Park CKD pile. A
    similar RIFS is planned to be submitted for the remaining CKD
    piles in 2008. The EPA approved a schedule for near-term
    activities, which includes consolidating certain CKD materials
    and installing collection trenches in the East Park leachate
    release area. In June 2006, the EPA approved an East Park CKD
    Removal Action Work Plan and Final Engineering Design for
    Consolidation. However, the EPA has not approved the RIFS for
    the East Park.


 


    As a result of the installation of collection systems at the Bay
    Harbor sites, CMS Land and CMS Capital are collecting and
    treating 135,000 gallons of liquid per day and shipping it by
    truck for disposal at a nearby well and at a municipal
    wastewater treatment plant located in Traverse City, Michigan.
    To address both short term and longer-term disposal of liquid,
    CMS Land has filed two permit applications with the MDEQ and the
    EPA, the first to treat the collected leachate at the Bay Harbor
    sites before releasing the water to Lake Michigan and the second
    to dispose of it in a deep injection well in Alba, Michigan,
    that CMS Land or its affiliate would own and operate. In
    February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS Land
    or its affiliate to construct and operate a deep injection well
    near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County. Certain
    environmental groups and a local township have indicated they
    may challenge these permits before the agencies or the courts.



    
    26



 



 


    CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, and the EPA have ongoing
    discussions concerning the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor
    sites. These negotiations are addressing, among other things,
    issues relating to the disposal of leachate, the location and
    design of collection lines and upstream diversion of water,
    potential flow of leachate below the collection system,
    applicable criteria for various substances such as mercury, and
    other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obliged to undertake.
    Negotiations have been ongoing for over a year, but CMS Land and
    CMS Capital have not been able to resolve these issues with the
    regulators and they remain pending.


 


    CMS Land has entered into various access, purchase and
    settlement agreements with several of the affected landowners at
    Bay Harbor, and entered into a confidential settlement with one
    landowner to resolve a lawsuit filed by that landowner. We have
    received demands for indemnification relating to claims made by
    a property owner at Bay Harbor. CMS Land has purchased five
    unimproved lots and two lots with houses.


 


    CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge of
    $140 million, which includes accretion expense, for its
    obligations. An adverse outcome of this matter could, depending
    on the size of any indemnification obligation or liability under
    environmental laws, have a potentially significant adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s financial condition and liquidity
    and could negatively impact CMS Energy’s results of
    operations. CMS Energy cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of this matter.


 



    CMS
    Energy retains contingent liabilities in connection with its
    asset sales.


 


    The agreements CMS Energy enters into for the sale of assets
    customarily include provisions whereby it is required to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    retain specified preexisting liabilities such as for taxes,
    pensions, or environmental conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties it makes; and




 



     
        • 

    
    make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits or other reviews.





 


    Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes CMS Energy may have concerning them,
    these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its
    financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations.


 



    Risks
    Related to CMS Energy and Consumers


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and they may be unable
    to obtain bank financing or access the capital
    markets.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    pursuant to commercial commitments under guarantees, indemnities
    and letters of credit.


 


    CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include: entering into leasing arrangements and refinancing
    and/or
    issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock
    and/or
    common equity. CMS Energy cannot guarantee the capital
    markets’ acceptance of its securities or predict the impact
    of factors beyond its control, such as actions of rating
    agencies. If CMS Energy is unable to obtain bank financing or
    access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness,
    there could be a material adverse effect upon its financial
    condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly,
    Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the capital
    markets and commercial lenders. Entering into new financings is
    subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility
    industry securities in general and to Consumers’ securities
    issuances in particular. Consumers cannot guarantee the capital
    markets’ acceptance of its securities or predict the impact
    of factors beyond its control, such as actions of rating
    agencies. If Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or
    access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness,
    there could be a material adverse effect upon its liquidity and
    operations.



    
    27



 



 


    Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit and
    could make its cost of borrowing higher. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy may have to post
    collateral or make prepayments to certain of its suppliers
    pursuant to existing contracts with them. In addition, certain
    bonds of Consumers are supported by municipal bond insurance
    policies, and the interest rates on those bonds have been
    affected by ratings downgrades of bond insurers. Further, any
    adverse developments to Consumers, which provides dividends to
    CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers’ credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of
    their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
    of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency.


 



    Regulatory
    changes and other developments have resulted and could continue
    to result in increased competition in the domestic energy
    business. Generally, increased competition threatens market
    share in certain segments of CMS Energy’s business and can
    reduce its and Consumers’ profitability.


 


    As of January 1, 2002, the Customer Choice Act allows all
    electric customers in Michigan the choice of buying electric
    generation service from Consumers or an alternative electric
    supplier. Consumers had experienced, and could experience in the
    future, a significant increase in competition for generation
    services due to ROA. At December 31, 2007, alternative
    electric suppliers were providing 315 MW of generation
    service to ROA customers. This amount represents 4 percent
    of Consumers’ total distribution load, which is down from a
    high of 12 percent in 2004. Consumers cannot predict the
    total amount of electric supply load that may be lost to
    competitor suppliers in the future.


 



    Electric
    industry regulation could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ business, including their ability to recover
    costs from their customers.


 


    Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ business,
    financial condition and profitability.


 


    There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. FERC is also
    reviewing the standards under which electric utilities are
    allowed to participate in wholesale power markets without price
    restrictions. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact
    of these electric industry restructuring proceedings on their
    financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur significant capital
    expenditures to comply with environmental standards and face
    difficulty in recovering these costs on a current
    basis.


 


    CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They expect that the cost of future environmental compliance,
    especially compliance with clean air and water laws, will be
    significant.


 


    In March 2005, the EPA adopted the Clean Air Interstate Rule
    that requires additional coal-fired electric generating plant
    emission controls for nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.
    Consumers plans to meet the nitrogen oxides requirements by
    installing equipment that reduces nitrogen oxides emissions and
    purchasing emissions allowances. Consumers also will meet the
    sulfur dioxide requirements by injecting a chemical that reduces
    sulfur dioxide emissions, installing scrubbers and purchasing
    emission allowances. Consumers plans to spend an additional
    $835 million for equipment installation through 2015.


 


    In March 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR, which requires initial
    reductions of mercury emissions from coal-fired electric
    generating plants by 2010 and further reductions by 2018.
    Certain portions of the CAMR were appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by a
    number of states and other entities. The U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia decided the case on
    February 8, 2008, and determined that the



    
    28



 




    rules developed by the EPA were not consistent with the Clean
    Air Act. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to monitor the
    development of federal regulations in this area.


 


    In April 2006, Michigan’s governor proposed a plan that
    would result in mercury emissions reductions of 90 percent
    by 2015. We are working with the MDEQ on the details of this
    plan; however, we have developed preliminary cost estimates and
    a mercury emissions reduction scenario based on our best
    knowledge of control technology options and initially proposed
    requirements. We estimate that costs associated with Phase I of
    the state’s mercury plan will be approximately
    $220 million by 2010 and an additional $200 million by
    2015.


 


    The EPA has alleged that some utilities have incorrectly
    classified plant modifications as “routine
    maintenance” rather than seeking permits from the EPA to
    modify their plants. Consumers responded to information requests
    from the EPA on this subject in 2000, 2002, and 2006. Consumers
    believes that it has properly interpreted the requirements of
    “routine maintenance.” If the EPA finds that its
    interpretation is incorrect, Consumers could be required to
    install additional pollution controls at some or all of its
    coal-fired electric generating plants and pay fines.
    Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the viability of
    continuing operations at certain plants.


 


    Several legislative proposals have been introduced in the United
    States Congress that would require reductions in emissions of
    greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. These laws, or
    similar state laws or rules, if enacted, could require Consumers
    to replace equipment, install additional equipment for pollution
    controls, purchase allowances, curtail operations, or take other
    steps.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from its
    customers, through the ratemaking process, these and other
    required environmental expenditures. However, if these
    expenditures are not recovered from customers in Consumers’
    rates, CMS Energy
    and/or
    Consumers may be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures, which could strain their
    cash resources. We can give no assurances that CMS Energy
    and/or
    Consumers will have access to bank financing or capital markets
    to fund any such environmental expenditures.


 



    Market
    performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit
    plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.


 


    The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s pension and postretirement benefit
    plans. CMS Energy has significant obligations in this area and
    holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are
    subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns,
    which may fall below CMS Energy’s forecasted return rates.
    A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the
    funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in
    demographics, including increased number of retirements or
    changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the
    funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension
    and postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy is unable to
    successfully manage its pension and postretirement plan assets,
    its results of operations and financial position could be
    affected negatively.


 



    Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets and other factors could result
    in recording additional impairment charges for their assets,
    which could have an adverse effect on their stockholders’
    equity and their access to additional financing. In addition,
    they may be required to record impairment charges at the time
    they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are able to
    secure and other factors.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers may be adversely affected by regulatory
    investigations regarding “round-trip” trading by CMS
    MST as well as civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that
    CMS MST and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.


 


    As a result of round-trip trading transactions (simultaneous,
    prearranged commodity trading transactions in which energy
    commodities were sold and repurchased at the same price) at CMS
    MST, CMS Energy is under



    
    29



 




    investigation by the DOJ. CMS Energy received subpoenas in 2002
    and 2003 from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices regarding
    investigations of those trades. CMS Energy responded to those
    subpoenas in 2003 and 2004.


 


    In March 2004, the SEC approved a
    cease-and-desist
    order settling an administrative action against CMS Energy
    relating to round-trip trading. The order did not assess a fine
    and CMS Energy neither admitted nor denied the order’s
    findings.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the
    investigations. It is possible that the outcome in one or more
    of the investigations could, affect adversely CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ financial condition, liquidity or results of
    operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers may be adversely affected by regulatory
    investigations and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information
    that CMS MST and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.


 


    CMS Energy has notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which
    compile and report index prices. CMS Energy is cooperating with
    an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. CMS
    Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation
    and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS
    Energy.


 


    CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc. (the company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera
    Gas Company are named as defendants in various lawsuits arising
    as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, Tennessee, and Wyoming.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the
    investigations. It is possible that the outcome in one or more
    of the investigations could affect adversely CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ financial condition, liquidity or results of
    operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to future terrorist attacks or related
    acts of war.


 


    The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ facilities due to storms, natural disasters,
    wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events, in excess of
    insurance recoveries and reserves established for these repairs,
    may adversely impact their results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows. The occurrence or risk of occurrence
    of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential
    unavailability of insurance to cover this terrorist activity may
    impact their results of operations and financial condition in
    unpredictable ways. These actions could also result in
    disruptions of power and fuel markets. In addition, their
    natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly
    or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity.


 



    Consumers
    may not prevail in the exercise of its regulatory-out rights
    under the MCV PPA.


 


    The MCV Partnership, which leases and operates the MCV Facility,
    contracted to sell electricity to Consumers for a
    35-year
    period beginning in 1990. The cost that Consumers incurred under
    the MCV PPA exceeded the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC,
    including $39 million in 2007, until it exercised the
    regulatory-out provision in the MCV PPA in September 2007. This
    action limited its capacity and fixed energy payments to the MCV
    Partnership to the amounts that it collects from its customers.
    However, it uses the direct savings from the RCP, after
    allocating a portion to customers, to offset a portion of its
    capacity and fixed energy underrecoveries expense. The MCV
    Partnership has notified Consumers that it disputes its right to
    exercise the regulatory-out provision. Consumers believes that
    the provision is valid and fully effective, but cannot assure
    that it will prevail in the event of a proceeding on this issue.


 


    As a result of our exercise of the regulatory-out provision, the
    MCV Partnership may, under certain circumstances, have the right
    to terminate or reduce the amount of capacity sold under the MCV
    PPA. If the MCV Partnership terminates the MCV PPA or reduces
    the amount of capacity sold under the MCV PPA, Consumers would
    seek to replace the lost capacity to maintain an adequate
    electric Reserve Margin. This could involve entering



    
    30



 




    into a new power purchase agreement or entering into electric
    capacity contracts on the open market. Consumers cannot predict
    its ability to enter into such contracts at a reasonable price.
    Consumers also is unable to predict regulatory approval of the
    terms and conditions of such contracts, or that the MPSC would
    allow full recovery of its incurred costs.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of these matters.


 



    Consumers’
    energy risk management strategies may not be effective in
    managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result
    in unanticipated liabilities to Consumers or increased
    volatility of its earnings.


 


    Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits may fluctuate
    substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose
    Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of
    Consumers’ operating expenses for its plants consists of
    the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages
    these risks using established policies and procedures, and it
    may use various contracts to manage these risks, including
    swaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can
    be made that these strategies will be successful in managing
    Consumers’ pricing risk, or that they will not result in
    net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in
    these markets.


 


    Natural gas prices in particular have historically been
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to offset
    its positions, such as hedging exposure to the risks of demand,
    market effects of weather and changes in commodity prices
    associated with its gas distribution business. These positions
    are taken in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which allows
    Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with
    those positions. However, Consumers does not always hedge the
    entire exposure of its operations from commodity price
    volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to
    commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets.
    As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid,
    Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management
    strategies, which could result in greater open positions than
    preferred at a given time. To the extent that open positions
    exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or worsen CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial condition or results
    of operations.


 



    Changes
    in taxation as well as inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these tax
    matters. The judgments include reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may
    be subject to challenge by IRS
    and/or other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers Energy
    could adversely affect their financial condition or results of
    operations.


 



    Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.


 


    Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are impacted
    by the economic cycles of the customers it serves. In its
    service territories in Michigan, the economy has been sluggish
    and hampered by negative developments in the manufacturing
    industry and limited growth in non-manufacturing sectors of the
    state’s economy. In the event economic conditions in
    Michigan or the region continue to decline, Consumers may
    experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that
    could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition,
    economic conditions in its service territory impact its
    collections of accounts receivable and its financial results.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.


 


    Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are
    generally seasonal businesses. Demand for electricity is greater
    in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and
    heating, and demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating
    season. Accordingly, its overall results in the future may
    fluctuate substantially on a seasonal

    basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and
    winter heating season will negatively impact CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ results of operations and cash flows.


 



    Unplanned
    power plant outages may be costly for Consumers.


 


    Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce
    electricity. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, Consumers
    may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity
    that exceed its costs of generation. Its financial condition or
    results of operations may be negatively affected if it is unable
    to recover those increased costs.


 



    Failure
    to implement successfully new processes and information systems
    could interrupt our operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers depend on numerous information systems
    for operations and financial information and billings. They are
    in the midst of a multi-year company-wide initiative to improve
    existing processes and implement new core information systems.
    Failure to implement successfully new processes and new core
    information systems could interrupt their operations.


 



    Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which
    could limit its ability to operate its facilities.


 


    Consumers is dependent on coal for much of its electric
    generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and
    transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If it
    is unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or
    future coal supply and transportation contracts, Consumers may
    be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or it may be
    forced to make additional MWh purchases through other
    potentially higher cost generating resources in the Midwest
    energy market. Higher coal costs increase its working capital
    requirements.
