 “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.In addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraph, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. In recent years, we experienced significant membership declines due to unfavorable economic conditions driving increased unemployment. In addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. These membership trends could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. See Part I,  “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for additional details of our licensing requirements and the impact if we were not to comply with these license agreements.Regulation GeneralOur operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state, federal and international regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. As discussed below, the regulatory aspects of the U.S. health care system have been and will continue to be significantly affected by Health Care Reform. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to:•grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business;•regulate many aspects of our products and services;•monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy;•scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria; and•impose monetary and criminal sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory requirements.To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our operations and accounts.Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business ActivityThe governments of the states in which we conduct business, as well as the federal government, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. Further, Health Care Reform has resulted in increased federal regulation that is likely to have a significant impact on our business. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly from state to state and on the federal level, may restrict how we conduct our businesses and may result in additional burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to:•medical loss ratios;•tax deductibility of certain compensation and Health Care Reform related fees;•licensure;•premium rates;•benefits;•eligibility requirements;•guaranteed availability and renewability;•service areas;•market conduct;•sales and marketing activities, including use and compensation of brokers and other distribution channels;•quality assurance procedures;•plan design and disclosures, including mandated benefits;•underwriting, marketing, pricing and rating restrictions for insurance products;-16-•utilization review activities;•prompt payment of claims;•member rights and responsibilities;•collection, access or use of protected health information;•data reporting, including financial data and standards for electronic transactions;•payment of dividends;•provider rates of payment;•surcharges on provider payments;•provider contract forms;•provider access standards;•premium taxes, assessments for the uninsured and/or underinsured and insolvency guaranty payments;•member and provider complaints and appeals;•financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements and investments);•reimbursement or payment levels for government funded business; and•corporate governance.These state and federal laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any jurisdiction where we do not presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. The health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, has created significant changes and will continue to create significant changes for health insurance markets for the next several years. Specifically, many of the near-term changes were effective for certain groups and individuals on their first renewal on or after September 23, 2010, including a prohibition on lifetime limits, certain annual limits, member cost-sharing on specified preventive benefits, pre-existing condition exclusions for children, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage and extension of coverage of dependents to the age of 26. Certain requirements for insurers were also effective in 2011, including changes to Medicare Advantage payments and the minimum MLR provision that requires insurers to pay rebates to customers when insurers do not meet or exceed the specified MLR thresholds. Most of the provisions of ACA with more significant effects on the health insurance marketplace, both state and federal, went into effect on January 1, 2014, including a requirement that insurers guarantee the issuance of coverage to all individuals regardless of health status, strict rules on how health insurance is rated, the assessment of new taxes and fees (including annual fees on health insurance companies), the creation of new insurance exchanges for individuals and small groups, the availability of premium subsidies for certain individual products, and substantial expansions in eligibility for Medicaid.Despite significant preparation for the advent of the new federal and state health insurance exchanges, there have been many technical difficulties in the implementation of the exchanges, which entail uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business. In November 2013, CMS notified the various state Insurance Commissioners that, under a transitional policy, health insurance coverage in the individual or small group market that is renewed for a policy year starting between -17-January 1, 2014 and October 1, 2014 that would otherwise have been deemed non-compliant with certain market reforms under Health Care Reform will nonetheless not be considered by CMS to be out of compliance with respect to such market reforms provided certain conditions are met. CMS further encouraged state agencies responsible for enforcing the specified market reforms to adopt the same transitional policy with respect to this coverage. Some states have adopted the transitional policy, some have not adopted it and yet others have not taken a position. Due to the impact of the transitional policy, we may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in the exchange markets. In addition, the risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridor premium stabilization programs of Health Care Reform, or Health Care Reform Premium Stabilization Programs, established to apportion risk amongst insurers, may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our exchange products. These factors, along with the limited information about the individuals who have access to these newly established exchanges that was available when we established premiums, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals. Any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.In addition, there have been other material changes and delays in the implementation of ACA that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. These include:•Delay in the effective date of the employer mandate from 2014 to 2015;•Extension of the 2013 open enrollment period to December 23, 2013 for a January 1, 2014 effective date;•Delay of the commencement of the 2014 open enrollment period from October 15 to November 15 through January 15, 2015; •Changes to the annual fees on health insurance companies; •Deferral of the online Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) enrollment capabilities; and •Other yet to be announced changes and delays.  These delays and changes may have a material and significant impact on anticipated enrollment in on- and off-exchange products, thus affecting the risk pools and premium rates. The technical difficulties in implementing exchanges have impacted the sharing of enrollment information between the federal government and health insurers and will significantly delay payment and subsidies to insurers. Finally, implementation of ACA brings with it significant oversight responsibilities by health insurers that may result in increased governmental audits, increased assertions of False Claims Act violations, and an increased risk of other litigation.  ACA continues to require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor, CMS and the Department of the Treasury. These regulatory agencies continue to consider recommendations from external groups, such as the NAIC. Many provisions have final rules available for review while some proposed regulations have been released for comment or have yet to be released and others are in-process. Of particular note is the yet to be issued regulation pertaining to administrative simplification to create uniformity in implementing electronic standards. We continue to carefully evaluate each rule as it is issued; and, therefore, it continues to be too early to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business. Some of the more significant considerations of ACA are described below:•MLR regulations were issued by HHS in December 2011; however, significant changes could still occur to the MLR requirements through additional regulatory guidance and/or modification of the regulation. The minimum MLR thresholds by line of business, as defined by HHS, are as follows:Line of Business %Large Group 85Small Group 80Individual 80-18-New York state regulations require us to meet a more restrictive MLR threshold of 82% for both Small Group and Individual lines of business. Certain other states have received approval from HHS to phase-in the MLR requirements in the Individual markets in those states and, as a result, are currently using lower thresholds for determination of potential rebates. The minimum MLR thresholds disclosed above are based on definitions of an MLR calculation provided by HHS, or specific states, as applicable, and differ from our calculation of “benefit expense ratio” based on premium revenue and benefit expense as reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Furthermore, the definitions of the lines of business differ under the various state and federal regulations and may not correspond to our lines of business. Definitions under the MLR regulation also impact insurers differently depending upon their organizational structure or tax status, which could result in a competitive advantage to some insurance providers that may not be available to us, resulting in an uneven playing field in the industry. Significant changes to the MLR requirements may occur through additional regulatory action by HHS. Approximately 63.1% and 27.3% of our premium revenue and medical membership, respectively, were subject to the minimum MLR regulations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. Approximately 74.4% and 28.5% of our premium revenue and medical membership, respectively, were subject to the minimum MLR regulations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Beginning with rebates paid in 2014 for the 2013 benefit year, MLR rebates will be based on a three year average. This calculation will determine an average MLR for each market segment within each state for the previous three calendar years. Additionally, insurers will be able to adjust experience to account for prior MLR rebates refunded to groups or individuals. Once the three year average MLR is calculated and compared to the minimum MLR threshold, the rebate percentage will be applied to current year premiums as defined by Health Care Reform. Beginning with MLR rebates paid in 2015 for the 2014 benefit year, insurers will adjust for the Health Care Reform Premium Stabilization Programs.Health Care Reform also imposes a separate minimum MLR threshold of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2014. Medicare Advantage plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate. If a plan’s MLR is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will be restricted. A Medicare Advantage plan contract will be terminated if the plan's MLR is below 85% for five consecutive years.  •ACA required states to establish health insurance exchanges by January 1, 2014 through which qualified individuals and qualified small employers may access coverage. If a state failed to establish a health insurance exchange, the federal government established a health insurance exchange in that state. To date sixteen states plus the District of Columbia have elected to operate state-based exchanges. The remaining states have either a federal partnership exchange (seven states) or a federally operated exchange (twenty-seven states). In the states in which we offer products on exchanges, six states have passed legislation or executive orders establishing state-based health insurance exchanges (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Nevada and New York).•ACA requires the modification of existing products and development of new products to meet the requirements of the legislation. Products must cover essential health benefits as defined in ACA along with many other requirements and cost sharing changes. Health insurers must offer individual and small group products that meet the definition of the “metal” requirements (bronze, silver, gold and platinum). Each metal product must satisfy a specific actuarial value. Health insurers participating in exchanges must offer at least one silver and one gold product. Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, health insurers were required to cancel or discontinue the sale of existing non-ACA-compliant individual and small group products, subject to the conditions of the November 2013 CMS transitional policy discussed above. •Regulations became effective in September 2011 that require filings for premium rate increases for small group and individual products above specified thresholds, generally 10%, to be reviewed. The regulations provide for state insurance regulators to conduct the reviews, except for cases where a state does not have an “effective” rate review program, in which case HHS will conduct the reviews for any rate increase filed.•The Health Care Reform Premium Stabilization Programs introduce new requirements to the MLR calculation, beginning with the 2014 benefit year for the individual and small group markets. The risk adjustment program is a permanent program that transfers dollars from insurers who enroll individuals with lower relative health risk to insurers who enroll individuals with higher relative health risk. Risk adjustment payments/receipts will be determined separately for each state and for individual and small group. The second premium stabilization program is the transitional reinsurance program, a temporary program that runs from 2014 through 2016. The transitional -19-reinsurance program is intended to help stabilize premiums by reimbursing issuers of ACA-compliant non-grandfathered individual market plans for eligible claims between a defined attachment point and ceiling, at a coinsurance rate defined by HHS. The program will be funded through assessments per covered enrollee upon the commercial health insurance market and sponsors of self-funded health benefit plans of approximately $12.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $5.0 billion in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The final premium stabilization program is the temporary risk corridors program, also a three year program through 2016, that protects insurers from inaccurate pricing of individual and small group qualified health plans and substantially similar off-exchange products.Beginning in 2014, MLR rebate calculations will be adjusted to reflect the Health Care Reform Premium Stabilization Programs. To determine an insurer’s MLR, the numerator of the MLR will be reduced by receipts from the risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors programs, or increased by payments from the risk adjustment and risk corridors programs. The denominator of the MLR formula will be reduced by reinsurance contributions. This adjusted insurer-specific MLR will then be compared to the minimum MLR threshold for each line of business. The Health Care Reform Premium Stabilization Programs are not applicable to Large Group business.•Through December 31, 2013 and depending on the laws in each state, health insurers were allowed to consider factors such as health status, gender and age in determining the appropriate premium for products in the individual and small group markets. Some states have adopted rules that limit the variation between the highest and lowest premium for the identical insurance policy. The differential in pricing is commonly referred to as “rating bands”. The process of using these rating bands allows health insurers to appropriately price for products and to spread the risk more broadly across all policyholders. Except for policies issued under the CMS transitional policy, beginning in 2014, ACA precludes health insurers from using health status and gender in the determination of the appropriate insurance premium. In addition, rating bands for age cannot vary by more than 3 to 1 and the rating bands for tobacco use cannot vary by more than 1.5 to 1. This change will likely have a significant impact on the majority of individual and small group customers and could lead to adverse selection in the market.•In 2014 significant new taxes and fees will be paid by health insurers, some of which may or may not be passed through to customers. The most significant of the taxes and fees is the annual fee on health insurance companies. For 2014, a total of $8.0 billion will be collected from all health insurance companies to which the annual fee is assessed. The annual fee is $11.3 billion for 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion for 2017 and $14.3 billion for 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the annual fee will equal the amount for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to the amount of health insurance for all U.S. health risk for those certain lines of business during the preceding calendar year.•Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates will not increase as much as they would otherwise due to a new payment formula promulgated by ACA that is expected to significantly reduce reimbursements in the future. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including the Medicare Advantage MLR, evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments and potential action on an audit methodology to review data submitted under “risk adjuster” programs.In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision affirming that the majority of the provisions of the ACA were constitutional. However, the provision of the ACA related to the mandatory expansion of state Medicaid programs was declared unconstitutional. Several cases pertaining to the constitutionality of the contraceptive mandate are currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court and will likely be heard and decided during the coming year. Other pending cases pertain to challenges to the premium tax subsidies and whether the subsidies are available for eligible residents in all states or only those residents in states which have established state-based exchanges. In January 2014, the D.C. District Court upheld the subsidies for both state-based and federal exchanges and an appeal is anticipated.Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection ActDuring 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a far-reaching overhaul of the framework for the U.S. financial services industry. Even though we are primarily a health benefits company, our business has been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of its provisions require the adoption of rules for implementation, including those that govern which non-bank financial companies may become subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. These non-bank financial companies are defined as those that could pose a threat to the economy’s financial stability either due to the -20-potential of material financial distress at the company or due to the company’s ongoing activities. While we are not currently considered a non-bank financial company for purposes of Federal Reserve oversight, future regulations or interpretations could change that result. Further, our investments in derivative instruments are subject to new rules regarding the reporting and clearing of transactions and new margin requirements.In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a Federal Insurance Office, with limited powers that include information-gathering and subpoena authority. Although the Federal Insurance Office does not have authority over health insurance, it may have authority over other parts of our business, such as life insurance.HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley ActThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most group health plans and certain individuals. Also, the law limits exclusions based on preexisting medical conditions.The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA imposed a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses). These requirements include uniform standards of common electronic health care transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers. Additional federal privacy and security requirements, including breach notification, improved enforcement and additional limitations on use and disclosure of protected health information were passed through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, Act provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and corresponding implementing regulations. CMS posted the Interim Final Rule with Comment, or IFC, adopting operating rules for two electronic transactions: eligibility for a health plan and health care claims status. Based on the comments received on the IFC, CMS has decided not to change any of the policies established in the rule. Thus, the interim final rule became the final rule. The rule had a January 1, 2013 compliance date and we believe we have effectively complied with the requirements of the new rule.In addition, there are proposed regulations on the HIPAA Privacy Accounting of Disclosures provisions and the HIPAA Security Rule that will greatly increase our administrative costs if they are enacted as proposed.The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. In addition, a number of states have adopted data security laws and/or regulations, regulating data security and/or requiring security breach notification, which may apply to us in certain circumstances.Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can also be subject to state laws and the question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many courts.HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws, including Risk-Based Capital RequirementsWe are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports -21-describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. The states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products. In general, under these laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as a company’s RBC declines. As of December 31, 2013, the RBC levels of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds.Guaranty Fund AssessmentsUnder insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively. Some states permit insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through future policyholder assessments.States’ adoption of the revised NAIC Model Guaranty Fund Act will tend to decrease our liability for insolvent insurers. The revised act reduces the premium base on which assessments are calculated, by omitting Medicare Parts C and D premium from the assessment base.While the amount and timing of any future assessments cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources with the exception of potential exposure related to the Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company insolvency as discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies”, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Form 10-K.EmployeesAt December 31, 2013, we had approximately 48,200 employees. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.Available InformationWe are a large accelerated filer (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act) and are required, pursuant to Item 101 of Regulation S-K, to provide certain information regarding our website and the availability of certain documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance. Federal Health Care Reform legislation, together with the changes in federal and state regulations that have been enacted to implement Health Care Reform, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The passage of Health Care Reform during 2010 and subsequent regulations represent significant changes to the U.S. health care system. The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state Medicaid programs and providing certain other individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. The legislation includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014. In addition, the new laws impose significant fees, assessments and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and other industry participants. Health Care Reform imposes an annual industry-wide $8.0 billion health insurer fee beginning in 2014 and growing to $14.3 billion by 2018 and increasing annually thereafter. This health insurance fee is not deductible for income tax purposes and will be allocated pro rata among us and other industry participants based on net premiums written. Health Care Reform also imposes industry-wide reinsurance assessments of $12.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $5.0 billion in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Insurance companies will pay the fees based upon insured members whereas self-insured entities will pay them directly to HHS. As we are one of the nation's largest health benefits companies, we expect our share of the Health Care Reform fees, assessments and taxes to be significant. There is some uncertainty whether we will be able to include all or a portion of these fees, assessments and taxes in our premium rates. Health Care Reform also imposes new regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum MLR and customer rebate requirements, creation of a federal rate review process, a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. The legislation also reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage program over time. There are also limitations on the amount of compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes. The legislation also contains risk adjustment provisions applicable to the individual and small group markets that take effect in 2014. These risk adjustment provisions will effectively transfer funds from health plans with relatively lower risk enrollees to plans with relatively higher risk enrollees to help protect against adverse selection. Effectively adapting to these risk adjustment provisions may require us to modify our operational and strategic initiatives to focus on and manage different populations of potential members than we have in the past. If we are not able to successfully design and implement operational and strategic initiatives to adapt to these changes in certain of our markets, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.Some of the provisions of Health Care Reform became effective immediately upon enactment, while most of the other provisions became effective in January 2014, with the remaining provisions to be phased in over the next several years. These -23-changes could impact us through potential disruption to the employer-based market, potential cost shifting in the health care delivery system to insurance companies and limitations on the ability to increase premiums to meet costs. We have dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, material resources and incurred, and will continue to incur, material expenses to implement and comply with Health Care Reform at both the state and federal levels, including implementing and complying with future regulations that provide guidance on and clarification of significant portions of the legislation. The Health Care Reform law and regulations are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Difficulties and delays with regard to implementation of provisions of Health Care Reform at the end of 2013, including with regard to the functionality of the federal and state health insurance exchanges and the lack of full cooperation and coordination between federal and state authorities as to implementation of Health Care Reform, have increased uncertainties and made our planning relating to Health Care Reform more difficult and unpredictable, which increases the risk that we will experience unanticipated adverse consequences arising out of Heath Care Reform.Finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the regulation of our business by state and federal regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance, managed health care and HMO subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance, managed health care or HMO regulatory authorities of each state in which they are licensed or authorized to do business, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure that future regulatory action by state insurance or HMO authorities or federal regulatory authorities will not have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of our participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, a number of our subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, and to changes in government regulations or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, eligibility requirements and additional governmental participation which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that application of the federal and/or state tax regulatory regime that currently applies to us will not, or future tax regulation by either federal and/or state governmental authorities concerning us could not, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. State legislatures will continue to focus on health care delivery and financing issues. Most states are very focused on how to manage and reduce their budgets and are exploring ways to mitigate costs. As such, some states have acted to reduce or limit increases to premium payments. Others have enacted, or are contemplating enacting, significant reform of their health insurance markets to include provisions affecting both public programs and privately-financed health insurance arrangements. We cannot assure you that, if enacted into law, these proposals would not have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, California has enacted legislation to establish minimum benefit expense ratio thresholds and continues to consider legislative proposals to require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases. California also has a November 2014 ballot initiative requiring prior regulatory approval of rate increases for the individual and small group products, which, if passed, could prevent us from securing necessary rate and benefit changes. If enacted, these state proposals could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that significant portions of the ACA, including the provisions regarding health care exchanges, are constitutional. As a result, some states have developed their own exchanges, while other states are relying on HHS to operate the exchange in their states or are implementing partnership exchanges with the Federal government. These multiple exchange options have led to increased uncertainties and made our planning for these health insurance exchanges more difficult. The Supreme Court decision also permitted states to opt out of the elements of Health Care Reform that require expansion of Medicaid coverage in January 2014 without losing their current federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, have indicated their current decision to opt out of Medicaid expansion, at least for the present time. If states allow certain programs to expire or choose to opt out of Medicaid expansion, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment and reduced growth opportunities. -24-Additionally, from time to time, Congress has considered, or may consider in the future, various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. There have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants’ ability to seek damages beyond the benefits offered under their plans. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure, could permit greater state regulation of our operations, and could expand the scope of damages, including punitive damages, litigants could be awarded. While we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Our inability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits or maintain our current provider agreements may adversely affect our business and profitability. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Last minute changes in the implementation of Health Care Reform at the end of 2013, in particular those relating to difficulties with the functionality of federal and state health insurance exchanges, may increase the likelihood that our assumptions underlying the pricing and design of our exchange products prove to be inaccurate in a way that materially adversely affects the expected profitability of those products. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Changes in health care practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations, particularly with respect to our products sold through the federal and state health insurance exchanges, as neither we nor our competitors have any prior experience with pricing such products or the utilization rates for medical or other covered services by members who purchase our products through such exchanges. The exchanges may increase the risk that our products will be selected by individuals who have a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established the pricing for these exchange products. Therefore, health care benefit costs in excess of our cost projections reflected in our exchange product pricing cannot be recovered in the current premium period through higher premiums; however, in certain circumstances, Federal risk adjustment mechanisms, including risk adjustment payments, risk corridors and reinsurance, could help offset health care benefit costs in excess of our projections. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends, utilization, enrollment, adverse selection, acuity and other assumptions utilized in setting our premium rates are significantly different than actual results, even with these risk adjustment mechanisms, our income statement and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customers may renegotiate their contracts to seek to contain their costs or may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. For example, ACA includes an annual rate review requirement to prohibit unreasonable rate increases, and beginning in 2014, our plans may be excluded from participating in the health insurance exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments or a lack of sufficient increase in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. To the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected. Our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other -25-health care providers. The failure to maintain or to secure cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, accountable care organizations, or ACO, practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which may impact our relationship with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flow could be adversely affected. Further, our inability to contract with providers, or if providers attempt to use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. In addition, we do not have contracts with all providers that render services to our members and, as a result, do not have a pre-established agreement about the amount of compensation those out-of-network providers will accept for the services they render, which can result in significant litigation or arbitration proceedings. A significant reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. A significant reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers; general economic downturn that results in business failures; employers no longer offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; state and federal regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; implementation of federal and state exchanges and underwriting changes in 2014; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations. There are various risks associated with participating in Medicaid and Medicare programs, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight. We contract with various state and federal agencies, including CMS, to provide managed health care services, including Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplement plans, Medicare approved prescription drug plans, Medicaid programs and CHIP. We also provide various administrative services for several other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their Medicare eligible members through our affiliated companies and we offer employer group waiver plans which provide medical and/or prescription drug coverage to retirees. We are also participating in Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible programs in several states. These programs in our Government Business segment have been the subject of recent regulatory reform initiatives, including Health Care Reform, which are still in the process of being implemented. It is difficult to predict the future impact of Health Care Reform on our Government Business segment due to Health Care Reform’s complexity, gradual and delayed implementation, and possible amendment. Health Care Reform, other regulatory reform initiatives or additional changes in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The base premium rate paid by each state or federal agency differs depending upon a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits, a member’s health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility category and risk scores. Future levels of Medicare and Medicaid rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain costs and may be further affected by state and federal budgetary constraints. If the federal government or any state in which we operate were to decrease rates paid to us, or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, certain of our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation in the event of the unavailability of state funds. In addition, the various states’ new Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible programs are still subject to uncertainty surrounding payment rates and other requirements, which could affect where we seek to participate in these new programs. An unexpected reduction, inadequate government funding or significantly delayed payments for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. A portion of our premium revenue comes from CMS through our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D contracts. As a consequence, our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans are dependent on federal government funding levels. The -26-premium rates paid to Medicare plans are established based on benchmarks which are now tied to a percentage of Medicare fee for service, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, including upper payment limits established by CMS, a member’s health profile and status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility categories and risk scores. Beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be subject to MLR rules. Continuing government efforts to contain health care related expenditures, including prescription drug cost, and other federal budgetary constraints that result in changes in the Medicare program, including changes with respect to funding, could lead to reductions in the amount of reimbursement, or other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks associated with the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans include potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members, increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, and the limited enrollment periods in this business. While we believe we have adequately reviewed our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs under Medicare Parts C and D, including those related to collectability of receivables and establishment of liabilities, the actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our contracts with the various state governmental agencies and CMS contain certain provisions regarding data submission, provider network maintenance, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements specific to state and federal program regulations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines, penalties, liquidated damages and retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans, that could impact our profitability. Additionally, we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with additional penalties for noncompliance, including a negative impact on future membership enrollment levels. Further, certain of our CMS and state Medicaid contracts are subject to a competitive procurement process, and if our existing contracts are not renewed or if we are not awarded new contracts as a result of this competitive procurement process, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the contractual requirements affecting our participation in Medicaid and Medicare programs, we are also subject to various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations or litigation, with the imposition of fines, restrictions or exclusions from program participation or the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other agreements with a federal or state governmental agency that could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Further, CMS has been conducting audits of our Medicare Advantage health plans to validate the diagnostic data and patient claims that are submitted to CMS. These audits may result in retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans. In addition, if we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, and on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The ACA also established recovery audit programs for Medicare Parts C and D. The Medicare Part D Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, has been auditing Medicare Part D claims and recouping overpayments since 2012, and CMS expects to award a Medicare Part C RAC contract in fiscal year 2014, which could increase the amount of audits and subsequent recoupments by the federal government. Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions.  Most of our revenues are generated in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of state specific or regional economic downturns impacting these states. If such negative economic conditions do not improve, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. -27-The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can adversely affect our business and profitability. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can arise from, among other things, the ongoing debate over Health Care Reform. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. In addition, as long as we use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Any such negative publicity could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face competition in many of our markets and customers and brokers have flexibility in moving between competitors. As a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from legislative reform, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, aggressive marketing practices by other health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and organized customer base, particularly among large employers. For example, beginning in 2014, we have started to compete for sales on insurance exchanges, which has required, and will continue to require, us to develop or acquire the tools (including social media tools) necessary to interact with the exchanges and with consumers using the exchanges, increase our focus on individual customers and improve our consumer-focused marketing, customer interfaces and product offerings. These factors have produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of health benefits companies. We are currently dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our health care products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and small employer group customers. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, who may also market the products of our competitors. Our relationship with our brokers and independent agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address Health Care Reform legislation, including potential reductions in commissions and consulting fees paid to agents and brokers. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We face intense competition to attract and retain employees. Further, managing key executive succession and retention is critical to our success. We are dependent on retaining existing employees, attracting additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains from our investment in technology. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management and retention of key executives. While we have succession plans in place for members of our senior management, and continue to review and update those plans, and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives, these plans and arrangements do not guarantee that the services of our senior executives will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to attract and retain suitable successors. A change in our health care product mix may impact our profitability. Our health care products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those health care products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk health care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also -28-involve our higher-risk health care products. It is not yet clear whether our products sold on the federal and state health insurance exchanges will be more or less profitable products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a holding company, we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are necessary to pay our outstanding indebtedness. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, maintenance of minimum levels of capital and restrictions on investment portfolios. We are a holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of common stock (or other ownership interest) of our subsidiaries including our intermediate holding companies and regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. As a holding company, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. Among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In some states we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Most of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the NAIC and require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. Our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk-based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. As discussed in more detail below, we are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA which contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations, including minimum capital and liquidity requirements, which could restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments. We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.  Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement. If we default under our credit agreement, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreement to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreement is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness. -29-A downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong credit ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers, since credit ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. If our credit ratings are downgraded or placed under review, with possible negative implications, such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and creditors, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock.We face risks related to litigation. We are, or may in the future, be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits and administrative charges before government agencies, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; the rescission of health insurance policies; development or application of medical policy; medical malpractice actions; product liability claims; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation; provider tiering programs; termination of provider contracts; the recovery of overpayments from providers; self-funded business; disputes over co-payment calculations; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business or corporate governance practices; the failure to comply with various state or federal laws, including but not limited to, ERISA and the Mental Health Parity Act; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. These actions or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are also involved in, or may in the future be party to, pending or threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of our operations or our 2001 demutualization, including, but not limited to, breaches of security and violations of privacy requirements, shareholder actions, compliance with federal and state laws and regulations (including qui tam or “whistleblower” actions), or sales and acquisitions of businesses or assets, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings, including challenges to the award of government contracts by disappointed bidders. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by various state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. Liabilities that may result from these actions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. Recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic (including injunctive relief), treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Our future obligations for state guaranty association assessments could increase in the event that Health Care Reform and its implementation result in increased insolvencies of health plans. Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state. While in the past, health insurance company insolvencies have been infrequent, the changes to the U.S. health care system and markets and related uncertainties from implementation of Health Care Reform may result in increased -30-insolvencies of health insurance companies covered by these state insolvency or guaranty association laws. In that event, we may experience increased guaranty association assessments for health insurer insolvencies, the amount and timing of which cannot be predicted with certainty.There are various risks associated with providing health care services. The direct provision of health care services by our CareMore subsidiary involves risks of additional litigation arising from medical malpractice actions based on our treatment decisions or brought against us or our physician associates for alleged malpractice or professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of health care and related services. In addition, liability may arise from maintaining health care premises that serve the public. If we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage for these liabilities, or if such insurance is not available, the resulting costs could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, many states in which we operate our CareMore subsidiary limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals. Business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians (“corporate practice of medicine”) and we are not licensed to practice medicine. Rules and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary from state to state. Further, certain federal and state laws, including those covering our Medicare and Medicaid plans, prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of patient care opportunities, including, but not limited to, Medicare patients (“anti-kickback rules”), and also generally prohibit physicians from making referrals to any entity providing certain designated health services if the referring physician or related person has an ownership or financial interest in the entity (“self-referral rules”). We believe that our health care service operations comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, anti-kickback, self-referral and similar issues. However, any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. We are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive and in certain areas non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks as identifiers for our products and services under licenses from the BCBSA. Our license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks, including: minimum capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the BCBSA; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health care plans and related services within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to health care plans and related services must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. For example, from time to time there have been proposals considered by the BCBSA to modify the terms of the license agreements to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. These proposals have included, among other things, a limitation on the ability of a -31-licensee to make its provider networks available to insurance carriers or other entities not holding a Blue Cross or Blue Shield license. To the extent that such amendments to the license agreements are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations. Further, BCBS licensees have certain requirements to perform administrative services for members of other BCBS licensees. If we or another BCBS licensee is not in compliance with all legal requirements or are unable to perform administrative services as required, this could have an adverse effect on our members and our ability to maintain our licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in one or more of our service areas. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in these service areas to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to “re-establish” a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield license in the vacated service area. The fee is set at $98.33 per licensed enrollee. As of December 31, 2013 we reported 26.6 million Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees. If the Re-establishment Fee was applied to our total Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees, we would be assessed approximately $2.6 billion by the BCBSA. Large-scale medical emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. For example, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a wide-spread pandemic of influenza coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines can have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters in our concentrated coverage areas or a large-scale pandemic or epidemic, our covered medical expenses could rise and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations or, in the event of extreme circumstances, our viability could be threatened. We have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances and we expect to pursue such opportunities in the future. The following are some of the risks associated with mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances (collectively, “business combinations”) that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:•some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow, business opportunities, synergies, growth prospects and other anticipated benefits;•the goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of our business combinations may be incorrectly valued or become non-recoverable;•we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which were under-estimated;•we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or as quickly as expected, and be unable to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;•business combinations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, result in the loss of key employees, divert resources, result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, -32-controls, information technology systems, policies and procedures;•we may finance future business combinations by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;•we may also incur additional debt related to future business combinations; and•we would be competing with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies.The value of our intangible assets may become impaired.Due largely to our past mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to income may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. In addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of business decisions we make associated with the implementation of the various Health Care Reform regulations. Such decisions, which could unfavorably affect our ability to support the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods. Adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness and pay capital expenditures. The principal sources of our cash receipts are premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If one or a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. One of our sources of liquidity is our $2,500.0 million commercial paper program under which we had only $379.2 outstanding at December 31, 2013. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we intend to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $2,000.0 million senior revolving credit facility to redeem our commercial paper when it matures. We believe the lenders participating in our senior credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. -33-The value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income. The market values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase, resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. In periods of rising interest rates, the market values of our fixed maturity securities will generally decrease, which could result in material unrealized or realized losses on investments in future periods. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform their obligations, could reduce net investment income, which would adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in future periods.  In accordance with FASB guidance for debt and equity investments, we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” or “trading” and report those securities at fair value. Current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities represented a significant percentage of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2013. Also, in accordance with applicable FASB accounting guidance, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis analyzing both quantitative and qualitative factors. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. Changes in the economic environment, including periods of increased volatility of the securities markets, can increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and we believe that we have appropriately estimated the fair values of our investment securities. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight, which could change our judgment regarding the fair value of certain securities and/or impairment. Given the sometimes rapidly changing market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses. We may not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we separately recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. At each financial reporting date, we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences. Our evaluation includes a review of the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset; the amount of taxes paid on both capital gains and ordinary income in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim; the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, the likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and any other significant issues that might impact the realization of the deferred tax asset. If it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance. Any future increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and a decrease in shareholders’ equity, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and profitability. As part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential member information. We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential -34-member and provider information, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and numerous state laws governing personal information. Despite the security measures we have in place to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cyber security breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, interrupt our operations and damage our reputation, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. As a result of our merger and acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, emerging cyber security risks and threats, evolving industry and regulatory standards including the minimum MLR rebates, exchanges and other aspects of Health Care Reform, compliance with legal requirements (such as a new set of standardized diagnostic codes, known as ICD-10), private insurance exchanges and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have a decrease in membership, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, have regulatory problems, sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, federal regulations require that we begin using ICD-10 by October 2014, which will require significant information technology investment. If we fail to adequately implement ICD-10 or comply with the operating rules, we may incur losses with respect to the resources invested and have other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations. Also, as we convert or migrate members to our more efficient and effective systems, the risk of disruption in our customer service is increased during the migration or conversion process and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to implement initiatives for more effective and efficient information technology systems by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, providers, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully implement all desired products or systems in a timely and effective manner. The failure to implement and maintain the most advanced technological capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors. We are dependent on the success of our relationship with a large vendor for a significant portion of our information system resources and certain other vendors for various other services. We have an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, pursuant to which we outsourced a significant portion of our data center operations and certain core applications development. We are dependent upon IBM for these support functions. The IBM agreement includes service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption, with significant financial penalties if these SLAs are not met, as well as termination assistance provisions obligating IBM to provide services during periods following transitions or terminations. If our relationship with IBM is significantly disrupted for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. We may not be adequately indemnified -35-against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the IBM agreement. In addition, some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant. We are a party to an agreement with Express Scripts whereby Express Scripts is the exclusive provider of PBM services to certain of our members, excluding Amerigroup and certain self-insured members that have exclusive agreements with different PBM service providers, provided however that Amerigroup will be transitioning to the Express Scripts agreement during 2014. The Express Scripts PBM services include, but are not limited to, pharmacy network management, home delivery, pharmacy customer service, claims processing, rebate management, drug utilization and specialty pharmaceutical management services. Accordingly, the agreement contains certain financial and operational requirements obligating both Express Scripts and us. The failure of either party to meet the respective requirements could potentially serve as a basis for early termination of the contract. If this relationship was terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. In addition, our failure to meet certain minimum script volume requirements may result in financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have also entered into agreements with certain vendors pursuant to which we have outsourced certain back-office functions. If any of these vendor relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. In addition, if for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting from loss of access to or availability of data, the physical location, technological resources and/or adequate human assets, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flow, financial conditions and results of operations may be unfavorably impacted. Indiana law, and other applicable laws, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider in their best interest. Indiana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. We are regulated as an insurance holding company and subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as similar provisions included in the health statutes and regulations of certain states where these subsidiaries are regulated as managed care companies or HMOs. The insurance holding company acts and regulations and these similar health provisions restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or HMO, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company, insurance company or HMO. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Further, the Indiana business corporation law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. Our articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of our capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors, both as defined in our articles of incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in us. These restrictions are intended to ensure our compliance with the terms of our licenses with the BCBSA. Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of our capital stock beyond these ownership limits without prior approval of a majority of our continuing directors (as defined in our articles of incorporation). In addition, as discussed above in the risk factor describing our license -36-agreements with the BCBSA, such license agreements are subject to termination upon a change of control and re-establishment fees would be imposed upon termination of the license agreements. Certain other provisions included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms (which is required by our license agreement with the BCBSA); permit our Board of Directors to determine the terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and prohibit shareholders from amending our bylaws. We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include:•any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles;•a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting;•our inability to convert to international financial reporting standards, if required;•failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies, including data security;•provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers;•failure to protect our proprietary information; and•failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.ITEM 1B
