Item 1A. Risk Factors

Further deterioration of economic conditions, including turmoil in the financial and credit markets, may further adversely affect our business. 

 
The deterioration in economic conditions over the course of 2008 and the current state of the global economy has adversely affected our customers and consumer spending and, as a result, our business has been adversely affected, as well. Conditions may remain depressed or may be subject to further deterioration and may lead to a continued reduction in consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Reduced sales by some of our wholesale customers, along with the possibility of their reduced access to, or inability to access, the credit markets, has and may continue to result in various retailers experiencing significant financial difficulties. Financial difficulties of customers has resulted and could continue to result in reduced sales by us to those customers and has resulted and could continue to result in store closures, restructurings, bankruptcies or liquidations. Higher credit risk relat
ing to receivables from customers experiencing financial difficulty may also result. Our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade receivables could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
The recent distress in the financial markets has also resulted in diminished liquidity and credit availability. As such, if conditions continue, there can be no assurance that we could obtain financing, or refinance existing debt, when the need arises or on terms that would be acceptable to us.

A substantial portion of our revenue and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue.

A few of our customers, including Macy’s, JCPenney, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 31.7% of our revenue in 2008, 30.2% of our revenue in 2007 and 30.6% of our revenue in 2006. Macy’s, our largest customer, accounted for 11.5% of our revenue in 2008, 9.7% of our revenue in 2007 and 11.4% of our revenue in 2006. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability.
 During the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes to be ongoing. In addition, store closings by our customers decrease the number of stores carrying our apparel products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
.

We may not be able to continue to develop and grow our Calvin Klein business in terms of revenue and profitability.

A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Calvin Klein business. Our realization of revenue and profitability growth from Calvin Klein will depend largely upon our ability to:

·
continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identity of the Calvin Klein brands;

·
continue to maintain good working relationships with Calvin Klein’s licensees; and

·
continue to enter into new licensing agreements for the Calvin Klein brands, both domestically and internationally.

We cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for the Calvin Klein brands, nor can we assure you that the launch of any Calvin Klein branded products or businesses by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space and develop new relationships with apparel retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to develop and grow successfully the Calvin Klein business, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

The success of Calvin Klein depends on the value of our Calvin Klein brands, and if the value of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends on our brands and their value. The Calvin Klein name is integral to the existing Calvin Klein business, as well as to our strategies for continuing to grow and expand Calvin Klein. The Calvin Klein brands could be adversely affected if Mr. Klein’s public image or reputation were to be tarnished.

Our level of debt could impair our financial condition.

We had approximately $400 million of long-term debt, $116 million of outstanding letters of credit and $209 million of additional amounts available for borrowing as of February 1, 2009. Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:

·
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;

·
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;

·
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;

·
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans and general corporate requirements;

·
placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, contributions to pension plans and general corporate requirements; and

·
any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including our revolving credit facility, leave us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.

Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

 
Substantially all of our revenue and expenses are currently denominated in United States dollars. However, certain of our operations and license agreements expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the rate of exchange of the United States dollar against the Euro, the Pound, the Yen and the Canadian dollar. Our principal exposure to changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar results from our licensing businesses. Many of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee’s local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to exchange rate changes during and up to the last day of the selling period. As a result, during times of a str
engthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be adversely affected. 

A secondary exposure to changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar results from our foreign operations. Our foreign operations include sales of our products to department and specialty stores throughout Canada and parts of Europe. Sales for these foreign operations are both generated and collected in foreign currency, which exposes us to foreign exchange gains and losses between the date of the sale and the date we collect payment. As with our licensing business, the results of these operations will be adversely affected during times of a strengthening United States dollar.

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.

Virtually all of our apparel and footwear products, excluding handmade neckwear, are produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in Europe, the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, South America, the Caribbean and Central America. We believe that we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. Although no single supplier or country is critical to our production needs, any of the following could materially and 


18




adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:

·
political or labor instability in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;

·
political or military conflict involving the United States, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;

·
heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;

·
a significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum-based synthetic fabrics, which are currently in high demand;

·
disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

·
the migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;

·
imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

·
imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

·
significant fluctuation of the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; and

·
restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located.

If our manufacturers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, our business could suffer.

We require our manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers to determine compliance. However, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices. If one of our manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. Any of the
se events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.

Our reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delay and damage customer relationships.

We rely upon independent third parties for all of our apparel and footwear products, excluding handmade neckwear. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. A manufacturer’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. 
 
We operate a limited number of distribution facilities. Our ability to meet the needs of our retail customers and of our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of our primary facilities. If any of our primary facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could have a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and our stores, and/or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the 


19




distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on royalties and licensing.

In 2008, $331.2 million, or 13.3%, of our revenue was derived from licensing royalties, advertising and other revenue, principally in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. Royalty, advertising and other revenue from Calvin Klein’s two largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 56% of its royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2008. We also derive licensing revenue from our Van Heusen, IZOD, Bass, G.H. Bass & Co. and ARROW brand names, as well as from the sublicensing of Geoffrey Beene. Our three largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 29% of royalty, advertising and other revenue for these brand names as a group in 2008. The operating profit associated with our royalty, advertising and other revenue is significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss
 of a significant licensing partner, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the licensing partner’s operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the partner), without an equivalent replacement, could materially affect our profitability.

While we generally have significant control over our licensing partners’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Our licensing partners’ failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing licensing partners could materially and adversely affect our revenue both directly from reduced royalty and advertising and other revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with our licensing partners’ ability to:

·
obtain capital;

·
execute their business plans, including timely delivery of quality products;

·
manage their labor relations;

·
maintain relationships with their suppliers;

·
manage their credit risk effectively; and

·
maintain relationships with their customers.

In addition, we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we make every attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. The misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Calvin Klein in the past has been involved in legal proceedings with Warnaco with respect to certain quality and distribution issues. As a result of our acquisition of Calvin Klein, Warnaco is entitled to control design and advertising related to the sale of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing the Calvin Klein marks, although to date, it continues to work
 with Calvin Klein’s in-house advertising agency while exercising its rights with respect to design. We cannot assure you that Warnaco will continue to maintain the same standards of design and, if it assumes control, advertising previously maintained by Calvin Klein, although we believe they are generally obligated to do so.

Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.

Our retail stores are located principally in outlet malls, which are typically located in or near vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. As a result, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including as a result of war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks, which would lead to decreased travel, could have a material adverse affect on us. In addition, we may be adversely affected by reduced travel due to economic conditions. Other factors which could affect the success of our stores include:

·
the location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;

·
the other tenants occupying space at the mall;


20





·
increased competition in areas where the outlet malls are located; and

·
the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls.

In 2008, certain of our businesses and those of certain of our licensees were adversely affected by the curtailment of travel that accompanied the global economic slowdown.

We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. Since our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we are more susceptible to infringement of our intellectual property rights, as the Calvin Klein brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the generally higher pricing of Calvin Klein branded products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenue. We cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from s
eeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license and/or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar marks. For example, we were involved in a proceeding relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to the IZOD mark in Mexico, and Calvin Klein was involved in a proceeding relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to the Calvin Klein m
ark in Chile. We are currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to marks similar to some of our brands, both domestically and internationally.

Our success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.

Our business strategy is to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. This strategy is designed to provide stability should market trends shift. As part of this strategy we license the names and brands of recognized designers and celebrities, including Kenneth Cole, Max Azria, Sean “Diddy” Combs (Sean John), Donald J. Trump, Michael Kors, Joseph Abboud, Donna Karan (DKNY), Tommy Hilfiger and Ike Behar. In entering into these license agreements, we target our products towards certain market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution in order to minimize competition between our own products and maximize profitability. If any of our licensors determines to “reposition” a brand we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribu
tion, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as products may be personally associated with these designers and celebrities, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individual’s images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.

We face intense competition in the apparel industry.

Competition is strong in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, some of which are significantly larger or more diversified or have greater resources than we do. In addition, through their use of private label programs, we compete directly with our wholesale customers. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:

·
anticipating and responding to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;

·
maintaining favorable brand recognition;

·
appropriately pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;

·
providing strong and effective marketing support;

 


21




·
ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and

·
obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we misjudge the market for our products, we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities with others.

The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies.

One component of our growth strategy contemplates our making select acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. However, these benefits may not be realized due to, among other things:

·
delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

·
higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

·
diversion of the attention and resources of management;

·
consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;

·
inability to retain key employees in acquired companies; and

·
assumption of liabilities unrecognized in due diligence.

We cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporate Law could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain provisions, including provisions requiring supermajority voting (80% of the outstanding voting power) to approve certain business combinations with beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding stock entitled to vote for election of directors, permitting the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board and authorizing the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of deterring changes of control.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors.
