Item 1A. Risk Factors    Set forth
below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Periods of economic slowdown or recession, significantly rising interest
rates, a declining employment level, a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur, can reduce volumes for many of our business lines. These economic conditions could result in a general decline in
rents,

which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases. In addition, these
conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets. An economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations
and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business. If our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted, it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our
various business lines. Further, as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments, our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened.  <FONT
SIZE="1">  If the properties that we manage fail to perform, then our financial condition and results of operations could be
harmed.    The revenue we generate from our asset
services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties, although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee. Accordingly, our success partially
depends upon the performance of the properties we manage. The performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors, among others, many of which are partially or completely outside of our control:  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"> 


 
•
 
our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants;   


 
•
 
the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases;   


 
•
 
our ability to control operating expenses;   


 
•
 
governmental regulations, local rent control or stabilization ordinances which are in, or may be put into, effect;  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"> 


 
•
 
various uninsurable risks;   


 
•
 
financial conditions prevailing generally and in the areas in which these properties are located;  <FONT

•
 
the nature and extent of competitive properties; and   


 
•
 
the real estate market generally.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do.
   We compete across a variety of business disciplines
within the commercial real estate industry, including investment management, tenant representation, corporate services, construction and development management, property management, agency leasing, valuation and mortgage brokerage. In general, with
respect to each of our business disciplines, we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition. Each of the
business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level. Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2005 revenue, our relative competitive
position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas. Depending on the product or service, we face competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment
banking firms, investment managers and accounting firms, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions. Many of our
competitors are local or regional firms. Although substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have
similar service competencies to ours.    Our international
operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States. During 2005, we generated
approximately 32.1% of our revenue from operations outside the

United States. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:   


 
•
 
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;   


 
•
 
currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the United States;  <FONT

•
 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   


 
•
 
potentially adverse tax consequences;

the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;  <FONT

•
 
the geographic, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world;  <FONT
SIZE="1"> 


 
•
 
greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in some geographic regions such as Asia, where many countries have underdeveloped insolvency laws and clients are often slow to
pay, and in some European countries, where clients also tend to delay payments;   


 
•
 
political instability; and   


 
•
 
foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.  <FONT
SIZE="1">  We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service
offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels. If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, to maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our
global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">In addition, our international operations and, specifically, the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our
subsidiaries, including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt, may be affected by limitations on imports, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other
things.    Our revenue and earnings may be adversely
affected by foreign currency fluctuations.    Our revenue
from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned. During 2005, approximately 32.1% of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which included the
Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar and the Australian dollar. Thus, we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. For example, during 2004, the U.S. dollar dropped in value against many of the currencies in which we conduct business.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">We have made significant acquisitions of non-U.S. companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future. As we increase our foreign
operations, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Due to the constantly changing currency
exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make
it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign
currencies. Economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt, and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position. These hedging
activities also may not be effective.

 Our growth has depended significantly upon acquisitions, which may not be available in the future.
   A significant component of our growth has occurred
through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Insignia in July 2003. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous
terms and conditions. However, future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions. In addition, acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with
expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses.
For example, through December 31, 2004, we incurred $200.9 million of transaction-related expenditures in connection with our acquisition of Insignia in 2003 and $87.6 million of transaction-related expenditures in connection with our
acquisition of CB Richard Ellis Services in 2001. Transaction-related expenditures included severance costs, lease termination costs, transaction costs, deferred financing costs and merger-related costs, among others. We incurred our final
transaction expenditures with respect to the Insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">If we acquire companies in the future, we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect.
   We have had, and may continue to experience,
difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies. These challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of
the acquired operations. We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income. Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and
management services and rationalizing personnel levels. In connection with the Insignia acquisition we have incurred $35.1 million of expenses through December 31, 2005, which are related to the integration of Insignia’s business lines, as
well as accounting and other systems, into our own.    If we are
unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire, we may not be able to effectively manage them. Moreover, the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of
geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed in the event of a future economic downturn
in the California real estate markets.    During 2004 and
2005, approximately 20.9% and 19.5%, respectively, of revenue was generated from transactions originating in California. As a result of the geographic concentration in California, any future economic downturn in the California commercial real estate
market and in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange County could harm our results of operations.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees
(including those acquired through acquisitions).    Our
continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Brett White, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Kenneth J. Kay, our Chief Financial Officer. Messrs. White and Kay
currently are not parties to employment agreements with us. We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant majority of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing
professionals. If any of our key employees leave, or we lose a significant number of key revenue producers, and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may
suffer. In

addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business, including
brokerage and property management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each
calendar year, which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal. Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and
higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year. The concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industry-wide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal year-end. This has historically resulted in lower
profits or a loss in the first and second quarters, with profits growing (or losses decreasing) in each subsequent quarter. This variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult, but does not
generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  We are leveraged and have debt service obligations. For 2005, our interest
expense was $54.3 million. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. In addition, we may
incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks
associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:   


 
•
 
we could be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt;  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"> 


 
•
 
our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other
general corporate requirements;   


 
•
 
our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because the loans under our amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities bear
interest at floating rates;   


 
•
 
our leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our
competitors that are less leveraged;   


 
•
 
our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry;
  


 
•
 
our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness, which, among others, require us to maintain specified financial
ratios and limit our ability to incur additional debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could harm our business or prospects; and  <P

in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any such future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our common
stock or changes in the interest rate for the term loan under our most recently amended and restated credit agreement.    <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%">We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do
not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  We are able to incur more indebtedness, which may intensify the risks
associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.    <FONT

also permits us to borrow up to $25.0 million of additional term loans under our term loan facility, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to
service our debt, would increase.    Our debt

 A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial
ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the holders of our 9 3/<FONT
SIZE="1">4% senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1/4%
senior subordinated notes due 2011, pursuant to the respective indentures, may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our senior secured credit
facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have
the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor. If the debt under the senior secured credit facilities, our 9<FONT
SIZE="1"> 3/4% senior notes due 2010 or our 11 1/<FONT
SIZE="1">4% senior subordinated notes due 2011 were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
   If we fail to meet our
payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  In connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured
credit facilities and the completion of our acquisition of Insignia, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries, including CB Richard Ellis
Services, Inc., CB Richard Ellis Investors, LLC, CBRE Melody, Insignia and CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, LLC, and 65% of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries. Additionally,
these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable, cash, general intangibles, investment property and future acquired material property. As a result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our payment or
other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  Our co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks
which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">An important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients. As of December 31, 2005, we had committed $31.2 million to fund future
co-investments. We expect that approximately $18.8 million of these commitments will be funded during 2006. In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our
subsidiaries holding investments in those assets, and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments. These adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our
co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors. Providing co-investment financing is also a very important part
of CB Richard Ellis Investor’s investment management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments. Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding
direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Participation in real estate transactions through co-investment activity could increase fluctuations in earnings and cash flow. Risks associated with these activities include, but are not limited to, the following:
  


 
•
 
losses from investments;   


 
•
 
difficulties associated with international co-investments described in “—Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business
in foreign countries” and “—Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations;” and   


 
•
 
potential lack of control over the disposition of any co-investments and the timing of the recognition of gains, losses or potential incentive participation fees.

 Our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which, if
realized, could harm our business.    We have utilized
joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other partnerships both in the United States and internationally, and although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures
in the future. In many of these joint ventures, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies
and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our business,
results of operations and financial condition.    If we
fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other business lines, we may incur significant financial penalties.  <FONT
SIZE="1">  Due to the broad geographic scope of our operations and the numerous forms of real estate services performed, we are subject
to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations specific to the services performed. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires us to maintain brokerage licenses in each U.S. state in which we
operate. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license, we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have licenses suspended. In addition, because the size and scope of real estate sales
transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous U.S. state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. Furthermore, the
laws and regulations applicable to our business, both in the United States and in foreign countries, also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance.  <FONT
SIZE="1">  We may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities.
   As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed
employees are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they
brokered or managed. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations as a broker.  <FONT
SIZE="1">  In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction and
engineering services for our managed properties. While our role is limited to that of a supervisor, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions. Adverse outcomes of property management litigation could negatively
impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Our stock price is subject to volatility.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors; changes to the competitive landscape; estimates and projections by the investment community; the arrival or
departure of key personnel; the introduction of new services by us or our competitors; and acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors. In addition, the stock market, in general, has historically experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations. Any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly, stockholders sometimes institute securities class
action lawsuits against the company. A securities class action lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business.  <P

should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the Securities
