Item 1A of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    In the case of statements about our investment banking
    transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk
    that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that
    they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,
    if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may
    differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
    Important factors that could result in a modification of the
    terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed
    include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or
    continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of
    hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or
    an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
    securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,
    a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain
    adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a
    party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required
    regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors
    that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions,
    see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.

    Where We Conduct
    Business


 


    As of November 28, 2008, we operated offices in over
    30 countries and 43% of our 30,067 employees were based outside
    the Americas (which includes the countries in North and South
    America). In 2008, we derived 30% of our net revenues outside of
    the Americas. See geographic information in Note 18 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our clients are located worldwide, and we are an active
    participant in financial markets around the world. We have
    developed and continue to build strong investment banking
    relationships in new and developing markets. We also continue to
    expand our presence throughout these markets to invest
    strategically when opportunities arise and to work more closely
    with our private wealth and asset management clients in these
    regions. Our global reach is illustrated by the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    we are a member of and an active participant in most of the
    world’s major stock, options and futures exchanges and
    marketplaces;




 



     
        • 

    
    we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond
    markets around the world;




 



     
        • 

    
    we have interbank dealer status in currency markets around the
    world;




 



     
        • 

    
    we are a member of or have relationships with major commodities
    exchanges worldwide; and




 



     
        • 

    
    we have commercial banking or deposit-taking institutions
    organized or operating in the United States, the United Kingdom,
    Ireland, Brazil, Switzerland, Germany, France, Russia and South
    Korea.





 


    Our businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research
    division, which, as of November 2008, provided research
    coverage of over 3,250 companies worldwide and over 45 national
    economies, and maintained a presence in locations around the
    world.


 


    We continue to expand our geographic reach. For example, in
    recent years we have opened offices in Mumbai, Moscow, Sao
    Paulo, Dubai, Qatar, Riyadh and Tel Aviv, become licensed as a
    broker-dealer
    in Russia, India and China, opened banks in Brazil, Ireland and
    Russia and entered into the asset management business in South
    Korea and India.

    Investment
    Banking


 


    Investment Banking represented 23% of 2008 net revenues. We
    provide a broad range of investment banking services to a
    diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,
    investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to
    develop and maintain
    long-term
    relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.


 


    Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry
    and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment
    bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually
    assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our
    clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to
    teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated
    fashion for the benefit of our clients.


 


    Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire
    resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment
    banking serving as “front of the house.” To accomplish
    this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and
    debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and
    liability management activities. This coordination is intended
    to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset
    and liability exposures and their capital.


 


    Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:
    Financial Advisory and Underwriting.


 



    Financial
    Advisory


 


    Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to
    mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense
    activities, restructurings and
    spin-offs.
    Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our
    significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions
    for which we provide multiple services, including
    “one-stop”
    acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as
    well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest
    rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number
    of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that
    we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.


 



    Underwriting


 


    Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of
    a wide range of securities and other financial instruments,
    including common and preferred stock, convertible and
    exchangeable securities,
    investment-grade
    debt,
    high-yield
    debt, sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank
    loans,
    asset-backed
    securities and real estate-related securities, such as
    mortgage-related
    securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.


 


    Equity Underwriting.  Equity underwriting has
    been a
    long-term
    core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and
    acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning
    mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our
    leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide
    public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex
    transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.


 


    Debt Underwriting.  We engage in the
    underwriting and origination of various types of debt
    instruments, including
    investment-grade
    debt securities,
    high-yield
    debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging market debt
    securities, which may be issued by, among others, corporate,
    sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and
    originate structured securities, which include
    mortgage-related
    securities and other
    asset-backed
    securities and collateralized debt obligations.

    Trading and
    Principal Investments


 


    Trading and Principal Investments represented 41% of 2008 net
    revenues. Trading and Principal Investments facilitates client
    transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial
    institutions, investment funds, governments and individuals and
    takes proprietary positions through market making in, trading of
    and investing in fixed income and equity products, currencies,
    commodities and derivatives on these products. In addition, we
    engage in
    market-making
    and specialist activities on equities and options exchanges, and
    we clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures
    exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and
    other investing activities, we make principal investments
    directly and through funds that we raise and manage.


 


    To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal
    Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We
    believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate
    client transactions distinguishes us from many of our
    competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.


 


    Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into
    three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities;
    Equities; and Principal Investments.


 



    Fixed Income,
    Currency and Commodities and Equities


 


    Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are
    large and diversified operations through which we engage in a
    variety of client-driven and proprietary trading and investing
    activities.


 


    In our client-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to
    deliver
    high-quality
    service by offering broad
    market-making
    and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In
    addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by
    committing capital and taking risk, to facilitate client
    transactions and to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make
    markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed
    income, currency, commodity and equity products and their
    derivatives is crucial to our client relationships and to
    support our underwriting business by providing secondary market
    liquidity.


 


    We generate trading net revenues from our client-driven
    businesses in three ways:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high
    volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.




 



     
        • 

    
    Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital
    position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where
    spreads and fees are generally larger.




 



     
        • 

    
    Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address
    complex client needs.





 


    Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination
    to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and
    expertise.


 


    In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we
    assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify,
    analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our
    analytical models to analyze information and make informed
    trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived
    disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and
    from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.

Table of Contents





    FICC


 


    We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products,
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed
    instruments, currencies and commodities, structure and enter
    into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in
    proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five principal
    businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies; interest
    rate products, including money market instruments; and
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products and other
    asset-backed
    instruments.


 


    Commodities.  We enter into trades with our
    clients in, make markets in, and trade for our own account a
    wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests
    in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products,
    metals, natural gas and electricity, and forest products. As
    part of our commodities business, we acquire and dispose of
    interests in, and engage in the development and operation of,
    electric power generation facilities and related activities.


 


    Credit Products.  We offer to and trade for our
    clients a broad array of credit and
    credit-linked
    products all over the world, including credit derivatives,
    investment-grade
    corporate securities,
    high-yield
    securities, bank and secured loans (origination and trading),
    municipal securities, and emerging market and distressed debt.
    For example, we enter, as principal, into complex structured
    transactions designed to meet client needs.


 


    In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan
    facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are
    extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended
    to be
    short-term
    in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other
    funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit origination
    activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on commitments
    by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to
    other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing the positions
    through investment vehicles sold to other investors.
    Underwriting fees from syndications of these commitments are
    recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment Banking segment.
    However, to the extent that we recognize losses on these
    commitments, such losses are recorded within our Trading and
    Principal Investments segment, net of any related underwriting
    fees. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Contractual Obligations and Commitments” in Part II,
    Item 7 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for additional information on our commitments.


 


    Our credit products business includes making significant
    long-term
    and
    short-term
    investments for our own account (sometimes investing together
    with our merchant banking funds) in a broad array of asset
    classes (including distressed debt) globally. We
    opportunistically invest in debt and equity securities and
    secured loans, and in private equity, real estate and other
    assets.


 


    Currencies.  We act as a dealer in foreign
    exchange and trade for our clients and ourselves in most
    currencies on exchanges and in cash and derivative markets
    globally.


 


    Interest Rate Products.  We trade and make
    markets in a variety of interest rate products, including
    interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and
    government bonds, as well as money market instruments, such as
    commercial paper, treasury bills, repurchase agreements and
    other highly liquid securities and instruments. This business
    includes our matched book, which consists of
    short-term
    collateralized financing transactions.


 


    Mortgage Business.  We make markets in and
    trade for our clients and ourselves commercial and residential
    mortgage-related
    securities and loan products (including agency prime and
    non-agency prime,
    Alt-A and
    subprime mortgages) and other
    asset-backed
    and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in these
    products for proprietary trading purposes as well as for
    securitization or syndication. We also originate and service
    commercial and residential mortgages.

    Equities


 


    We make markets in and trade equities and
    equity-related
    products, structure and enter into equity derivative
    transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate
    commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on
    major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our
    Equities client franchise and clearing activities.


 


    Equities includes two principal businesses: our client franchise
    business and principal strategies. We also engage in specialist
    and insurance activities.


 


    Client Franchise Business.  Our client
    franchise business includes primarily client-driven activities
    in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities
    markets. These activities also include clearing client
    transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges
    worldwide, as well as our options specialist and
    market-making
    businesses. Our client franchise business increasingly involves
    providing our clients with access to electronic
    “low-touch”
    equity trading platforms, and electronic trades account for the
    majority of our client trading activity in this business.
    However, a majority of our net revenues in this business
    continues to be derived from our traditional
    “high-touch”
    handling of more complex trades. We expect both types of trading
    activities to remain important components of our client
    franchise business.


 


    We trade equity securities and
    equity-related
    products, including convertible securities, options, futures and
    over-the-counter
    (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis as an agent, as
    a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a principal, we
    facilitate client transactions, often by committing capital and
    taking risk, to provide liquidity to clients with large blocks
    of stocks or options. For example, we are active in the
    execution of large block trades. We also execute transactions as
    agent and offer clients direct electronic access to trading
    markets.


 


    In the options and futures markets, we structure, distribute and
    execute derivatives on market indices, industry groups,
    financial measures and individual company stocks to facilitate
    client transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop
    strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging
    and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also
    create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated
    investors to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or
    liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading
    participants in the trading and development of equity derivative
    instruments. In options, we are a specialist
    and/or
    market maker on the International Securities Exchange, the
    Chicago Board Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the Boston Options
    Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, NYSE Alternext US and
    the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.


 


    Principal Strategies.  Our principal strategies
    business is a multi-strategy investment business that invests
    and trades our capital across global markets. Investment
    strategies include fundamental equities and relative value
    trading (which involves trading strategies designed to take
    advantage of perceived discrepancies in the relative value of
    financial instruments, including equity,
    equity-related
    and debt instruments), event-driven investments (which focus on
    event-oriented special situations such as corporate
    restructurings, bankruptcies, recapitalizations, mergers and
    acquisitions, and legal and regulatory events), convertible bond
    trading, various types of volatility trading and principal
    finance.


 


    At the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008, we reassigned
    approximately
    one-half of
    the traders and other personnel and transferred approximately
    one-half of
    the firm’s assets comprising our principal strategies
    business to our asset management business in an effort to
    strengthen and diversify our asset management offerings. These
    assets are invested in an alternative investment fund managed by
    our asset management business.

    Specialist Activities.  Our specialist
    activities business consists of our stock and
    exchange-traded
    funds (ETF) specialist and
    market-making
    businesses. We engage in specialist and
    market-making
    activities on equities exchanges. In the United States, we are
    one of the leading designated market makers for stocks traded on
    the NYSE. For ETFs, we are registered market makers on NYSE Arca.


 


    Insurance Activities.  Through our insurance
    subsidiaries, we engage in a range of insurance and reinsurance
    businesses, including buying, originating
    and/or
    reinsuring variable annuity and life insurance contracts,
    reinsuring property catastrophe and residential homeowner risks
    and providing power interruption coverage to power generating
    facilities.


 



    Principal
    Investments


 


    Principal Investments primarily represents net revenues from
    three primary sources: returns on corporate and real estate
    investments; overrides on corporate and real estate investments
    made by merchant banking funds that we manage; and our
    investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial
    Bank of China Limited (ICBC).


 


    Returns on Corporate and Real Estate
    Investments.  As of November 2008, the
    aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held
    directly or through our merchant banking funds, excluding our
    investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, was
    $15.13 billion, comprised of corporate principal
    investments with an aggregate carrying value of
    $12.16 billion and real estate investments with an
    aggregate carrying value of $2.97 billion. In addition, as
    of November 2008, we had outstanding unfunded equity
    capital commitments of up to $13.47 billion, comprised of
    corporate principal investment commitments of
    $10.39 billion and real estate investment commitments of
    $3.08 billion.


 


    Overrides.  Consists of the increased share of
    the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds
    when the return on a fund’s investments over the life of
    the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred
    to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues
    when all material contingencies have been resolved.


 


    ICBC.  Our investment in the ordinary shares of
    ICBC was acquired on April 28, 2006. The ordinary
    shares acquired from ICBC are subject to transfer restrictions
    that, among other things, prohibit any sale, disposition or
    other transfer until April 28, 2009. From
    April 28, 2009 to October 20, 2009, we may
    transfer up to 50% of the aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that
    we owned as of October 20, 2006. We may transfer the
    remaining shares after October 20, 2009. As of
    November 2008, the fair value of our investment in the
    ordinary shares of ICBC was $5.50 billion. A portion of our
    interest is held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.
    For further information regarding our investment in the ordinary
    shares of ICBC, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies —
    Fair Value — Cash Instruments” in Part II,

    Asset Management
    and Securities Services


 


    Asset Management and Securities Services represented 36% of 2008
    net revenues. Our asset management business provides investment
    advisory and financial planning services and offers investment
    products (primarily through separately managed accounts and
    commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse
    group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily
    generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees.
    Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing
    services and securities lending services to institutional
    clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and
    foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the
    form of interest rate spreads or fees.


 


    Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided
    into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.


 



    Asset
    Management


 


    We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and
    planning. We provide asset management services and offer
    investment products (primarily through separately managed
    accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and
    private investment funds) across all major asset classes: money
    markets, fixed income, equities and alternative investments
    (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies,
    commodities and asset allocation strategies). Through our
    subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P., we also provide fee-based
    financial counseling and financial education in the United
    States.


 


    Assets under management (AUM) typically generate fees as a
    percentage of asset value, which is affected by investment
    performance and by inflows and redemptions. The fees that we
    charge vary by asset class, as do our related expenses. In
    certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive
    fees based on a percentage of a fund’s return or when the
    return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark
    returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are
    recognized when the performance period ends and they are no
    longer subject to adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee
    arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that
    end on December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have
    been seasonally weighted to our first quarter.


 


    AUM includes our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and
    separately managed accounts for institutional and individual
    investors. Alternative investments include our merchant banking
    funds, which generate revenues as described below under
    “— Management
    of Merchant Banking Funds.” AUM includes assets in
    clients’ brokerage accounts to the extent that they
    generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather than
    commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.


 


    AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate
    commissions,
    mark-ups and
    spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments
    in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are
    included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM
    also does not include
    non-fee-paying
    assets, including interest-bearing deposits held through our
    bank depository institution subsidiaries.

    Management of Merchant Banking Funds.  Goldman
    Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private
    investment funds. As of November 2008, the amount of AUM in
    these funds (including both funded amounts and unfunded
    commitments on which we earn fees) was $93 billion.


 


    Our strategy with respect to these funds generally is to invest
    opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is
    diversified by industry, product type, geographic region, and
    transaction structure and type. Our corporate investment funds
    pursue, on a global basis,
    long-term
    investments in equity and debt securities in privately
    negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and
    investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real
    estate investment funds invest in real estate operating
    companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and
    other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant
    banking funds include funds that invest in infrastructure and
    infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.


 


    Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue
    streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a
    percentage of a fund’s committed capital, invested capital,
    total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual
    management fees are included in our Asset Management net
    revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in
    some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the
    funds’ unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from
    changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon
    realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return
    for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the
    fund’s income and gains that is a percentage of the income
    and gains from the fund’s investments. The second and third
    of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments
    within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.

    Securities
    Services


 


    Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing
    services and securities lending services to institutional
    clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and
    foundations, and to
    high-net-worth
    individuals worldwide.


 


    Prime brokerage services.  We offer prime
    brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility
    to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for
    financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime
    brokerage business provides clearing and custody in 53 markets
    globally and provides consolidated multi-currency accounting and
    reporting, fund administration and other ancillary services.


 


    Financing services.  A central element of our
    prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our
    clients for their securities trading activities through margin
    and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash
    or other acceptable collateral.


 


    Securities lending services.  Securities
    lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending
    of securities to cover clients’ and Goldman Sachs’
    short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In
    addition, we are an active participant in the
    broker-to-broker
    securities lending business and the
    third-party
    agency lending business. Net revenues in securities lending
    services are, as a general matter, weighted toward our second
    and third quarters each year due to seasonally higher activity
    levels in Europe.


 



    Global Investment
    Research


 


    Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on
    companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and
    macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.


 


    Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of
    November 2008 provided research coverage of over 3,250
    companies worldwide and over 45 national economies. This is
    accomplished by the following departments:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    The Equity Research Departments provide fundamental analysis,
    earnings forecasts and investment opinions for equity securities;




 



     
        • 

    
    The Credit Research Department provides fundamental analysis,
    forecasts and investment opinions as to
    investment-grade
    and
    high-yield
    corporate bonds and credit derivatives; and




 



     
        • 

    
    The Global ECS Department (formed in December 2008 through
    a consolidation of the Economic, Commodities and Strategy
    Research Departments) formulates macroeconomic forecasts for
    economic activity, foreign exchange and interest rates, provides
    research on the commodity markets, and provides equity market
    forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector
    allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies
    and options research.





 


    Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is
    provided below under “— Regulation —
    Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States”
    and “Legal Proceedings — Research Independence
    Matters” in Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report
    on
    Form 10-K.

    Business
    Continuity and Information Security


 


    Business continuity and information security are high priorities
    for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been
    developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity
    in the event of disruptions at the firm’s critical
    facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Because we are
    a bank holding company, our Business Continuity Program will be
    subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements
    of the program are crisis management, people recovery
    facilities, business recovery, systems and data recovery, and
    process improvement. In the area of information security, we
    have developed and implemented a framework of principles,
    policies and technology to protect the information assets of the
    firm and our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the
    confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
    resources.


 



    Employees


 


    Management believes that a major strength and principal reason
    for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication
    of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We
    strive to maintain a work environment that fosters
    professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our
    employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.


 


    Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a
    continuous process, in which training plays an important part.
    All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in
    education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various
    locations throughout the world. Another important part of
    instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review
    process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and
    employees they supervise in a
    360-degree
    review process that is integral to our team approach.


 


    As of November 2008, we had 30,067 employees, excluding
    4,671 employees of certain consolidated entities that are held
    for investment purposes only. Consolidated entities held for
    investment purposes are entities that are held strictly for
    capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are
    engaged in activities that are not closely related to our
    principal businesses.


 



    Competition


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that
    provide investment banking, securities and investment management
    services, as well as those entities that make investments in
    securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and
    other financial assets. These entities include brokers and
    dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance
    companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,
    private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of
    our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product
    or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,
    including transaction execution, our products and services,
    innovation, reputation and price.


 


    We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining
    qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete
    effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to
    attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing
    employees.

    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
    This trend accelerated over the course of the past year as the
    credit crisis caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions
    among industry participants. Many commercial banks and other
    broad-based
    financial services firms have had the ability for some time to
    offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and
    insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking
    services, which may enhance their competitive position. They
    also have had the ability to support investment banking and
    securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other
    financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share,
    which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking
    and trading businesses and could result in pricing pressure in
    other of our businesses.


 


    Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,
    pressure to retain market share by committing capital to
    businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may
    not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate
    clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate
    in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities)
    from financial services firms in connection with investment
    banking and other assignments.


 


    We provide these commitments primarily through GS Bank USA and
    its subsidiaries, including our William Street entities and
    Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. With respect to most of the
    William Street commitments, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group,
    Inc. (SMFG) provides us with credit loss protection that is
    generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on
    approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of
    $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of
    certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide
    protection for 70% of additional losses on such commitments, up
    to a maximum of $1.13 billion, of which $375 million
    of protection has been provided as of November 2008. We
    also use other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks
    related to certain William Street commitments not covered by
    SMFG. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Contractual Obligations and Commitments” in Part II,
    Item 7 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for more information regarding the William Street entities and
    for a description of the credit loss protection provided by
    SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with
    investment banking and other assignments do not meet the
    criteria established for the William Street entities and do not
    benefit from the SMFG loss protection. These commitments are
    issued through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries or our other
    subsidiaries.


 


    The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly
    increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our
    competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of
    the securities and other financial services markets. As a
    result, we have had to commit capital to support our
    international operations and to execute large global
    transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant
    challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete
    successfully with financial institutions that are larger and
    better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence
    and longer operating history outside the United States.


 


    We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
    businesses in recent years. There has been considerable pressure
    in the pricing of block trades. Also, equity and debt
    underwriting discounts, as well as trading spreads, have been
    under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute
    trades electronically, through the internet and through
    alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on
    trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward
    electronic and other
    “low-touch,”
    low-commission
    trading will continue. We believe that we will continue to
    experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the
    future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by
    reducing prices.

    Regulation


 


    Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the banking, securities,
    commodity futures and options and insurance industries, is
    subject to extensive regulation in the United States and the
    other countries in which we operate. See “Risk
    Factors — Our businesses and those of our clients are
    subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the
    world” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have
    on our businesses. As a matter of public policy, regulatory
    bodies around the world are charged with safeguarding the
    integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with
    protecting the interests of clients participating in those
    markets, including depositors in U.S. depository
    institutions such as GS Bank USA. They are not, however,
    generally charged with protecting the interests of Goldman
    Sachs’ shareholders or creditors.


 


    On September 21, 2008, Group Inc. became a bank
    holding company under the BHC Act. As of that date, the Federal
    Reserve Board became the primary U.S. regulator of Group
    Inc., as a consolidated entity. Prior to
    September 21, 2008, Group Inc. was subject to
    regulation by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE)
    and was subject to
    group-wide
    supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital
    standards on a consolidated basis. On
    September 26, 2008, the SEC announced that it was
    ending the CSE program. Our principal
    U.S. broker-dealer,
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) remains subject to
    regulation by the SEC.


 



    Banking
    Regulation


 



    Supervision
    and Regulation


 


    As a bank holding company under the BHC Act, Group Inc. is now
    subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve
    Board. Under the system of “functional regulation”
    established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board
    supervises Group Inc., including all of its nonbank
    subsidiaries, as an “umbrella regulator” of the
    consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary
    U.S. regulators of Group Inc.’s U.S. depository
    institution subsidiary, as applicable, and to the other
    U.S. regulators of Group Inc.’s
    U.S. non-depository
    institution subsidiaries that regulate certain activities of
    those subsidiaries. Such “functionally regulated”
    non-depository
    institution subsidiaries include
    broker-dealers
    registered with the SEC, insurance companies regulated by state
    insurance authorities, investment advisors registered with the
    SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities and
    entities regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission (CFTC) with respect to certain futures-related
    activities.


 



    Activities


 


    The BHC Act generally restricts us from engaging in business
    activities other than the business of banking and certain
    closely related activities. However, the BHC Act also grants a
    new bank holding company, such as Group Inc., two years from the
    date the entity becomes a bank holding company to comply with
    the restrictions on its activities imposed by the BHC Act with
    respect to any activities that it was engaged in when it became
    a bank holding company. We expect that this
    “grandfather” right will allow us to continue to
    conduct our business substantially as we have in the past until
    at least September 22, 2010. In addition, under the
    BHC Act, we can apply to the Federal Reserve Board for up to
    three
    one-year
    extensions.


 


    Under the
    U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley
    Act of 1999 (GLB Act), an eligible bank holding company may
    elect to become a “financial holding company.”
    Financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of
    financial and related activities than are permissible for bank
    holding companies as long as they continue to meet the
    eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. These
    activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in
    securities, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking
    investments in nonfinancial companies. In addition, the GLB Act
    also allows a company that was not a bank holding company and
    becomes a financial holding company after
    November 12, 1999 to continue to engage in certain
    commodities activities that are otherwise



    
    17



Table of Contents




    impermissible for bank holding companies if the company was
    engaged in any of these activities in the United States as of
    September 30, 1997 and if the assets held pursuant to
    these activities do not equal 5% or more of the consolidated
    assets of the bank holding company.


 


    We intend to apply to elect to become a financial holding
    company under the GLB Act as soon as practicable. Our ability to
    achieve and maintain financial holding company status is
    dependent on a number of factors, including our
    U.S. depository institution subsidiaries continuing to
    qualify as “well capitalized” as described under
    “— Prompt
    Corrective Action” below. We do not believe that any
    activities that are material to our current or currently
    proposed business would be impermissible activities for us as a
    financial holding company.


 


    As a bank holding company, Group Inc. is required to obtain
    prior Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or
    indirectly acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares
    of any unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a
    bank holding company, we may generally engage in banking and
    other financial activities abroad, including investing in and
    owning
    non-U.S. banks,
    if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits
    and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board.


 



    Capital
    Requirements


 


    We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered
    by the U.S. federal banking agencies. Our bank depository
    institution subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to
    similar capital guidelines. Under the Federal Reserve
    Board’s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory
    framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that is applicable
    to GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs and its bank depository
    institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines
    that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and
    certain
    off-balance-sheet
    items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices.
    Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution
    subsidiaries’ capital amounts, as well as GS Bank
    USA’s PCA classification, are also subject to qualitative
    judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings
    and other factors. We anticipate reporting capital ratios as
    follows:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    Before we became a bank holding company, we were subject to
    capital guidelines by the SEC as a CSE that were generally
    consistent with those set out in the Revised Framework for the
    International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
    Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
    (Basel II). We currently compute and report our firmwide capital
    ratios in accordance with the Basel II requirements as
    applicable to us when we were regulated as a CSE for the purpose
    of assessing the adequacy of our capital. We expect to continue
    to report to investors for a period of time our Basel II capital
    ratios as applicable to us when we were regulated as a CSE.




 



     
        • 

    
    The regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank
    holding companies are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel
    Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I), with Basel II to be
    phased in over time. We are currently working with the Federal
    Reserve Board to put in place the appropriate reporting and
    compliance mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of
    the Basel I capital ratios as of the end of March 2009.




 



     
        • 

    
    In addition, we are currently working to implement the Basel II
    framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company (as
    opposed to as a CSE). U.S. banking regulators have
    incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing
    risk-based
    capital requirements by requiring that internationally active
    banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to Basel
    II over the next several years.





 


    Under the Basel II framework as it applied to us when we were
    regulated as a CSE, we evaluate our Tier 1 Capital and
    Total Allowable Capital as a percentage of
    Risk-Weighted
    Assets (RWAs). RWAs are calculated based on the level of market
    risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with our
    business activities, using methodologies generally consistent
    with those set out in Basel II. Our



    
    18



Table of Contents




    Tier 1 Capital consists of common shareholders’
    equity, qualifying preferred stock (including the cumulative
    preferred stock issued by Group Inc. to the U.S. Department
    of the Treasury’s (U.S. Treasury) TARP Capital
    Purchase Program and our junior subordinated debt issued to
    trusts, less deductions for goodwill, disallowed intangible
    assets and other items. Our Total Allowable Capital consists of
    our Tier 1 Capital and our qualifying subordinated debt,
    less certain deductions. Additional information on the
    calculation of our Tier 1 Capital, Total Allowable Capital
    and RWAs under the Basel II framework as it applied to us
    as a CSE is set forth in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Equity Capital — Consolidated
    Capital Requirements,” and in Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements, which are in Part II,
    Items 7 and 8 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    As of November 2008, our Total Capital Ratio (Total
    Allowable Capital as a percentage of RWAs) was 18.9% and our
    Tier 1 Ratio (Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of RWAs)
    was 15.6%, in each case calculated under the Basel II framework
    as it applied to us when we were regulated as a CSE.


 


    As noted above, we are currently working to implement the Basel
    II framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company (as
    opposed to as a CSE). During a parallel period, we anticipate
    that Group Inc.’s capital calculations computed under both
    the Basel I rules and the Basel II rules will be reported to the
    Federal Reserve Board for examination and compliance for at
    least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel
    period and subsequent three-year transition period are
    successfully completed, Group Inc. will utilize the Basel II
    framework as its means of capital adequacy assessment,
    measurement and reporting and will discontinue use of Basel I.
    Internationally, the Basel II framework was implemented in
    several countries during the second half of 2007 and in 2008,
    while others will begin implementation in 2009. The Basel II
    rules therefore also apply to certain of our operations in
    non-U.S. jurisdictions.


 


    The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage
    ratio guidelines. We were not subject to these guidelines before
    becoming a bank holding company and, accordingly, we are
    currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our
    methodology for calculating this ratio. The Tier 1 leverage
    ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital (as applicable to us as
    a bank holding company) divided by adjusted average total assets
    (which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain
    intangible assets). The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3%
    for bank holding companies that have received the highest
    supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board guidelines or
    that have implemented the Federal Reserve Board’s
    risk-based
    capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies
    must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Bank
    holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above
    the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition,
    risk profile and growth plans. As of November 2008, our
    estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%. This ratio
    represents a preliminary estimate and may be revised in
    subsequent filings as we continue to work with the Federal
    Reserve Board to finalize the methodology for the calculation.


 


    GS&Co. will continue to calculate its regulatory capital
    requirements in accordance with the market and credit risk
    standards of Appendix E of
    Rule 15c3-1
    under the Exchange Act, which are consistent with Basel II.


 



    Payment of
    Dividends


 


    Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of
    dividends by our bank depository institution subsidiaries. The
    amount of dividends that may be paid by a state-chartered bank
    that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as GS Bank
    USA or our national bank trust company subsidiary, is limited to
    the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent
    earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test.
    Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if
    the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar
    year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined
    with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless
    the bank obtains the approval of its chartering authority. Under
    the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess
    of a bank’s “undivided profits.” New York law
    imposes similar limitations on New York State-



    
    19



Table of Contents




    chartered banks. As a result of these restrictions, GS Bank USA
    was not able to declare dividends to Group Inc. without
    regulatory approval as of November 2008.


 


    In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the
    banking regulators have authority to prohibit or to limit the
    payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise
    if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a
    dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light
    of the financial condition of the banking organization.


 


    It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank
    holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out
    of net income available to common shareholders over the past
    year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention
    appears consistent with the bank holding company’s capital
    needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the
    current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve
    Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully
    review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend
    pay-out ratios that are at the 100% level unless both asset
    quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also
    should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure
    on the capital of bank depository institution subsidiaries, or
    that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to
    serve as a source of strength for such bank depository
    institution subsidiaries. See
    “— U.S. Treasury’s
    TARP Capital Purchase Program” below for a discussion of
    additional restrictions on Group Inc.’s ability to pay
    dividends. In addition, certain of Group Inc.’s nonbank
    subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory limitations on
    dividends and distributions, including our
    broker-dealer
    and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.


 



    Source of
    Strength


 


    Under Federal Reserve Board policy, Group Inc. is expected to
    act as a source of strength to GS Bank USA and to commit capital
    and financial resources to support this subsidiary. The required
    support may be needed at times when, absent that Federal Reserve
    Board policy, we may not find ourselves able to provide it.
    Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary
    banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to
    certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the
    event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any
    commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank
    regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be
    assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
    payment.


 


    However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation
    of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the
    BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring
    payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository
    institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to
    such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could
    instead require the divestiture of the depository institution
    and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.


 



    Cross-guarantee
    Provisions


 


    Each insured depository institution “controlled” (as
    defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be
    held liable to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC) for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected
    to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other
    insured depository institution controlled by that holding
    company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of
    those banks that is in danger of default. Such a
    “cross-guarantee” claim against a depository
    institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims
    of the holding company and its affiliates against that
    depository institution. At this time, we control only one
    insured depository institution for this purpose, namely GS Bank
    USA. However, if, in the future, we were to control other
    insured depository institutions, such cross-guarantee would
    apply to all such insured depository institutions.

    U.S. Treasury’s
    TARP Capital Purchase Program


 


    On October 28, 2008, Group Inc. issued preferred stock
    and a warrant to purchase its common stock to the
    U.S. Treasury as a participant in the TARP Capital Purchase
    Program. Prior to October 28, 2011, unless we have
    redeemed all of this preferred stock or the U.S. Treasury
    has transferred all of this preferred stock to a third party,
    the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for us
    to, among other things, increase our common stock dividend above
    the current quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share or
    repurchase our common stock or outstanding preferred stock
    except in limited circumstances. In addition, until the
    U.S. Treasury ceases to own any Group Inc. securities sold
    under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the compensation
    arrangements for our senior executive officers must comply in
    all respects with the U.S. Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 and the rules and regulations thereunder. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Equity
    Capital — Equity Capital Management” in
    Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of our participation in the
    U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program.


 



    FDIC Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program


 


    Group Inc. and GS Bank USA have chosen to participate in the
    FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which
    applies to, among others, all U.S. depository institutions
    insured by the FDIC and all U.S. bank holding companies,
    unless they have opted out of the TLGP or the FDIC has
    terminated their participation. Under the TLGP, the FDIC
    guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of Group Inc. and GS
    Bank USA, as well as noninterest-bearing transaction account
    deposits at GS Bank USA, and in return for these guarantees the
    FDIC is paid a fee based on the amount of the deposit or the
    amount and maturity of the debt. Under the debt guarantee
    component of the TLGP, the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal
    and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the
    uncured failure of the participating entity to make a timely
    payment of principal or interest in accordance with the terms of
    the instrument. Under the transaction account guarantee
    component of the TLGP, all noninterest-bearing transaction
    accounts maintained at GS Bank USA are insured in full by the
    FDIC until December 31, 2009, regardless of the
    standard maximum deposit insurance amount. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Funding Risk — Conservative Liability Structure”
    in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a further discussion of our participation in the TLGP.


 



    GS Bank
    USA


 


    Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, GS Bank USA, a New
    York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
    System and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board
    and the New York State Banking Department and is subject to
    minimum capital requirements that (subject to certain
    exceptions) are similar to those applicable to bank holding
    companies. GS Bank USA was formed in November 2008 through
    the merger of our existing Utah industrial bank (named GS Bank
    USA) into our New York limited purpose trust company, with the
    surviving company taking the name GS Bank USA. Concurrently with
    this merger, we contributed subsidiaries with an aggregate of
    $117.16 billion of assets into GS Bank USA (which brought
    total assets in GS Bank USA to $145.06 billion as of
    November 2008). As a result, a number of our businesses are now
    conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA, including:
    bank loan trading and origination; interest rate, credit,
    currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial
    and residential mortgage origination, trading and servicing;
    structured finance; and agency lending, custody and hedge fund
    administration services. The businesses conducted through GS
    Bank USA are now subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
    Board, the New York State Banking Department and the FDIC.

    Deposit
    Insurance


 


    GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the
    benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The
    FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on
    insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk
    category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits
    that it holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment
    rate schedule on a
    semi-annual
    basis. We are also participants in the TLGP as discussed above
    under
    “— FDIC
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.”


 



    Prompt
    Corrective Action


 


    The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
    Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal
    banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in
    respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified
    capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories
    for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately
    capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
    and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution is
    deemed to be “well capitalized,” the highest category,
    if it has a total capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1
    capital ratio of 6% or greater and a Tier 1 leverage ratio
    of 5% or greater and is not subject to any order or written
    directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain
    a specific capital level for any capital measure. In connection
    with the November 2008 asset transfer described below, GS Bank
    USA agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to minimum capital
    ratios in excess of these “well capitalized” levels.
    Accordingly, for a period of time, GS Bank USA is expected to
    maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total
    capital ratio of at least 11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio
    of at least 6%. We contributed subsidiaries with an aggregate of
    $117.16 billion in assets into GS Bank USA in November 2008
    (which brought total assets in GS Bank USA to
    $145.06 billion as of November 2008). As a result, we are
    currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our
    methodology for the Basel I calculations. As of November
    2008, under Basel I, GS Bank USA’s estimated
    Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9% and estimated total capital
    ratio was 11.6%. In addition, GS Bank USA’s estimated
    Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.1%. An institution may be
    downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is
    lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is
    determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it
    receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to
    certain matters.


 


    FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
    operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital
    category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital
    guidelines could also subject a depository institution to
    capital raising requirements. Ultimately, critically
    undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of
    a receiver or conservator.


 


    The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to
    depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such
    as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized
    to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based
    upon the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s
    depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances
    relating to an undercapitalized depository institution
    subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to
    guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized
    subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable
    for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments
    on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy
    of the parent holding company, the guarantee would take priority
    over the parent’s general unsecured creditors.


 



    Insolvency of
    an Insured Depository Institution


 


    If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an
    insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its
    insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and
    liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the
    depository institution’s creditors;






    
    22



Table of Contents



 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s
    contracts pursuant to their terms; or




 



     
        • 

    
    to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the
    depository institution is a party, the performance of which is
    determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or
    repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the
    orderly administration of the depository institution.





 


    In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit
    liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses
    against an insured depository institution would be afforded a
    priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
    institution, including claims of debt holders of the
    institution, in the “liquidation or other resolution”
    of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or
    not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS
    Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently from,
    and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the
    depositors of the depository institution.


 



    Transactions
    with Affiliates


 


    Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and its
    subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve
    Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of
    transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from GS
    Bank USA) that may take place and generally require those
    transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These regulations
    generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and
    its subsidiaries. In November 2008, Group Inc. transferred
    assets and operations to GS Bank USA as described above under
    “— GS
    Bank USA.” In connection with this transfer, Group Inc.
    entered into a guarantee agreement with GS Bank USA whereby
    Group Inc. agreed to (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain
    transferred assets (other than derivatives and mortgage
    servicing rights) or reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses
    relating to those assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for
    credit-related
    losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA; and
    (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain
    losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights
    transferred to GS Bank USA. Group Inc. also agreed to pledge to
    GS Bank USA collateral with an aggregate value at any time not
    less than 5% of the face amount of committed but unfunded credit
    lines plus the original transfer value of the assets transferred
    to GS Bank USA, which amounted to a required collateral value of
    approximately $7.1 billion as of November 2008.


 



    Trust Companies


 


    Group Inc.’s two limited purpose trust company subsidiaries
    operate under state or federal law. They are not permitted to
    and do not accept deposits (other than as incidental to their
    trust activities) or make loans and, as a result, are not
    insured by the FDIC. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A.,
    a national banking association that is limited to fiduciary
    activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the
    Currency and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The
    Goldman Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited
    purpose trust company, is regulated by the Office of the
    Delaware State Bank Commissioner.


 



    U.S. Securities
    and Commodities Regulation


 


    Goldman Sachs’
    broker-dealer
    subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects
    of the securities business, including sales methods, trade
    practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and
    securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of
    clients’ purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers
    and employees.


 


    In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible
    for the administration of the federal securities laws.
    GS&Co. is registered as a
    broker-dealer
    and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a
    broker-dealer
    in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory
    organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that
    apply to, and examine,
    broker-dealers
    such as GS&Co. In addition, state securities and other
    regulators also have regulatory or oversight



    
    23

    authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also
    subject to regulation by various
    non-U.S. governmental
    and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in
    virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs
    Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and two of its
    subsidiaries are registered
    U.S. broker-dealers
    and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs
    Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC
    derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives
    businesses.


 


    The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the
    United States is subject to regulation under the
    U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal
    agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of
    Goldman Sachs’ subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and
    GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission
    merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading
    advisors and are subject to the CEA. The rules and regulations
    of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago
    Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other
    futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also
    govern the commodity futures and commodity options businesses of
    these entities.


 


    GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to
    Rule 15c3-1
    of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform
    minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require
    that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept
    in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to
    compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with
    the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted
    by
    Rule 15c3-1.
    As of November 2008, GS&Co. had regulatory net
    capital, as defined by
    Rule 15c3-1,
    of $10.92 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by
    $8.87 billion. As of November 2008, GSEC had
    regulatory net capital, as defined by
    Rule 15c3-1,
    of $1.38 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by
    $1.29 billion. In addition to its alternative minimum net
    capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold
    tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net
    capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the
    market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of
    Rule 15c3-1.
    GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that
    its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of
    November 2008, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and
    net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification
    requirements. These net capital requirements may have the effect
    of prohibiting these entities from distributing or withdrawing
    capital and may require prior notice to the SEC for certain
    withdrawals of capital. See Note 17 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by
    a number of securities exchanges. As a Designated Market Maker
    on the NYSE and as a specialist on other exchanges, we are
    required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which
    we are assigned. Under the NYSE’s new Designated Market
    Maker rules, this may require us to supply liquidity to these
    markets in certain circumstances.


 


    J. Aron & Company is authorized by the

    Other Regulation
    in the United States


 


    Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
    insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they
    are domiciled and in the other states in which they are
    licensed, and we are subject to oversight as an insurance
    holding company in states where our insurance subsidiaries are

    domiciled. State insurance regulations limit the ability of our
    insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Group Inc. in certain
    circumstances, and could require regulatory approval for any
    change in “control” of Group Inc., which may include
    control of 10% or more of our voting stock. In addition, a
    number of our other businesses, including our lending and
    mortgage businesses, require us to obtain licenses, adhere to
    applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of
    various regulators in the states in which we conduct these
    businesses.


 


    The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA
    PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money
    laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the
    implementation of various regulations applicable to all
    financial institutions, including standards for verifying client
    identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor
    client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through
    these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to
    promote the identification of parties that may be involved in
    terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.
    Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain
    some similar provisions. The obligation of financial
    institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their
    clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to
    respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities
    and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with
    other financial institutions, has required the implementation
    and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls
    that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs,
    and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could
    subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.


 



    Regulation Outside
    the United States


 


    Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the
    United Kingdom under the regulation of the Financial Services
    Authority (FSA). Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our
    regulated U.K.
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements imposed by the FSA. As of
    November 2008, GSI was in compliance with the FSA capital
    requirements. Other subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs
    International Bank, are also regulated by the FSA.


 


    Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe), our regulated
    Irish bank, is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed
    by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. As of
    November 2008, this bank was in compliance with all
    regulatory capital requirements. Group Inc. has issued a general
    guarantee of the obligations of this bank.


 


    Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the
    banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the
    European countries in which they operate, including, among
    others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and
    the Bundesbank in Germany, Banque de France and the
    Autorité des Marchés Financiers in France, Banca
    d’Italia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società
    e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial Markets
    Service in Russia and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.
    Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the
    European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of
    which they are members.


 


    The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA
    and other regulators within the European Union (EU) are
    regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which
    implement EU directives requiring, among other things,
    compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer
    protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting
    rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly
    implemented, under the same directives, throughout the EU.


 


    Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese
    broker-dealer,
    is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japan’s
    Financial Services Agency. As of November 2008, GSJCL was
    in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements. GSJCL is
    also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities
    Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities
    Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the
    Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.

    Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong
    Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities
    Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service,
    the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board
    of India, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and
    also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to
    the rules of the SEC.


 


    Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and
    regulatory authorities in other
    non-U.S. countries
    in which Goldman Sachs operates, including, among others, Brazil
    and Dubai. In addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries
    are regulated by Lloyd’s (which is, in turn, regulated by
    the FSA) and by the Bermuda Monetary Authority.


 



    Regulations
    Applicable in and Outside the United States


 


    The U.S. and
    non-U.S. government
    agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,
    as well as state securities commissions and other state
    regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct
    administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the
    issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or
    expulsion of a
    broker-dealer
    or its directors, officers or employees. From time to time, our
    subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and
    proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of
    various regulations relating to our activities, none of which
    has had a material adverse effect on us or our businesses.


 


    The research areas of investment banks have been and remain the
    subject of regulatory scrutiny. The SEC and FINRA have rules
    governing research analysts, including rules imposing
    restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts
    and investment banking personnel at member securities firms.
    Various
    non-U.S. jurisdictions
    have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements
    with respect to research and may impose additional regulations.
    In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement with certain
    federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory
    organizations to resolve investigations into equity research
    analysts’ alleged conflicts of interest. The global
    settlement includes certain restrictions and undertakings that
    have imposed additional costs and limitations on the conduct of
    our businesses, including restrictions on the interaction
    between research and investment banking areas.


 


    In connection with the research settlement, we have also
    subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on
    the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to
    executives and directors of public companies. The FSA in the
    United Kingdom has imposed requirements on the conduct of the
    allocation process in equity and fixed income securities
    offerings (including initial public offerings and secondary
    distributions). The SEC, the FSA, FINRA and other U.S. or
    non-U.S. regulators
    may in the future adopt additional and more stringent rules with
    respect to offering procedures and the management of conflicts
    of interest, and we cannot fully predict the effect that any new
    requirements will have on our business.


 


    Our investment management businesses are subject to significant
    regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating
    to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and
    our management of client funds.


 


    As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold
    capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency
    requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning
    the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based
    upon its underlying risk.


 


    Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with
    regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,
    the European Union or other jurisdictions
    and/or
    enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges
    relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees
    or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations
    could expose us to liability
    and/or
    reputational damage.

    Item 1A.  Risk
    Factors


 


    We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in
    our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,
    operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some
    of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
    conditions in the global financial markets and economic
    conditions generally.


 


    Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable
    earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by
    conditions in the global financial markets and economic
    conditions generally. In the past twelve months, these
    conditions have changed suddenly and negatively.


 


    Since mid-2007, and particularly during the second half of 2008,
    the financial services industry and the securities markets
    generally were materially and adversely affected by significant
    declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a
    serious lack of liquidity. This was initially triggered by
    declines in the values of subprime mortgages, but spread to all
    mortgage and real estate asset classes, to leveraged bank loans
    and to nearly all asset classes, including equities. The global
    markets have been characterized by substantially increased
    volatility and
    short-selling
    and an overall loss of investor confidence, initially in
    financial institutions, but more recently in companies in a
    number of other industries and in the broader markets. The
    decline in asset values has caused increases in margin calls for
    investors, requirements that derivatives counterparties post
    additional collateral and redemptions by mutual and hedge fund
    investors, all of which have increased the downward pressure on
    asset values and outflows of client funds across the financial
    services industry. In addition, the increased redemptions and
    unavailability of credit have required hedge funds and others to
    rapidly reduce leverage, which has increased volatility and
    further contributed to the decline in asset values.


 


    Market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a
    number of prominent financial institutions. Financial
    institution failures or near-failures have resulted in further
    losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them
    and defaults under bilateral derivatives and other contracts
    entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore,
    declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer
    loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well
    as other factors, have all combined to increase credit default
    swap spreads, to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings,
    and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability
    of liquidity, despite very significant declines in central bank
    borrowing rates and other government actions. Banks and other
    lenders have suffered significant losses and have become
    reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due to the increased
    risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the
    value of collateral. The markets for securitized debt offerings
    backed by mortgages, loans, credit card receivables and other
    assets have for the most part been closed.


 


    In 2008, governments, regulators and central banks in the United
    States and worldwide have taken numerous steps to increase
    liquidity and to restore investor confidence, but asset values
    have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to
    be very limited.


 


    We have “long” proprietary positions in a number of
    our businesses. These positions are accounted for at fair value,
    and the declines in the values of assets have had a direct and
    large negative impact on our earnings in fiscal 2008. Revenues
    from our asset management and merchant banking businesses were
    also negatively impacted by declines in the values of assets
    managed for our clients.


 


    The ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in
    financial institutions has increased our cost of funding and
    limited our access to some of our traditional sources of
    liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings.
    While the numerous steps taken by governments, regulators and
    central banks have helped reduce these funding costs somewhat
    and increase our access to traditional and new sources of
    liquidity, increases in funding costs and limitations on our
    access to liquidity have



    
    27



Table of Contents




    negatively impacted our earnings and our ability to engage in
    certain activities. In particular, in the latter half of 2008,
    we were unable to raise significant amounts of
    long-term
    unsecured debt in the public markets, other than as a result of
    the issuance of securities guaranteed by the FDIC under the
    TLGP. We are able to have outstanding approximately
    $35 billion of debt under the TLGP that is issued prior to
    June 30, 2009. It is unclear when we will regain
    access to the public
    long-term
    unsecured debt markets on customary terms or whether any similar
    program will be available after the TLGP’s scheduled
    June 2009 expiration. However, we continue to have access
    to
    short-term
    funding and to a number of sources of secured funding, both in
    the private markets and through various government and central
    bank sponsored initiatives. In December 2008, Moody’s
    Investors Service downgraded our
    long-term
    debt credit rating and Standard & Poor’s
    downgraded both our
    long-term
    and
    short-term
    debt credit ratings, in each case with an outlook of
    “negative.”


 


    We have been able to fund our operations during fiscal 2008. Our
    global core excess (our cash and cash equivalent positions
    maintained to ensure
    short-term
    liquidity) and our capital ratios are at levels significantly
    higher than in the past. Nevertheless, our credit spreads have
    widened and the average maturity of our new funding has
    decreased. Recently, we have relied to a significant extent for
    our
    long-term
    unsecured funding on emergency funding programs implemented by
    governments and central banks. It is unclear whether or for how
    long these facilities will be extended and what impact
    termination of these facilities could have on our ability to
    access funding. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Funding Risk” in
    Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Furthermore, the increased riskiness of assets due to increases
    in the volatility of asset prices, coupled with market concerns
    about the levels of financial institution leverage ratios, as
    well as fewer attractive business opportunities, have caused us
    to significantly decrease the size of our balance sheet and to
    increase the size of our global core excess. Both of these steps
    may have a negative effect on our profitability, until reversed.


 


    Concerns about financial institution profitability and solvency
    as a result of general market conditions, particularly in the
    credit markets, together with the forced merger or failure of a
    number of major commercial and investment banks, have at times
    caused a number of our clients to reduce the level of business
    that they do with us, either because of concerns about the
    safety of their assets held by us or simply arising from a
    desire to diversify their risk or for other reasons. Some
    clients have withdrawn some of the funds held at our firm or
    transferred them from deposits with GS Bank USA to other types
    of assets (in many cases leaving those assets in their brokerage
    accounts held with us). Some counterparties have at times
    refused to enter into certain derivatives and other
    long-term
    transactions with us or have requested additional collateral.
    These instances were more prevalent during periods when the lack
    of confidence in financial institutions was most widespread and
    have become significantly less frequent in recent months in the
    wake of government and central bank actions, greater
    understanding of client account protections and higher limits of
    FDIC insurance. In addition, we have acquired some new clients
    as a result of the difficulties experienced by other financial
    institutions.


 


    During the fourth quarter of 2008, we raised $20.75 billion
    in equity, comprised of a $5.75 billion public common stock
    offering, a $5 billion preferred stock and warrant issuance
    to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain affiliates and a
    $10 billion preferred stock and warrant issuance under the
    U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program. While this
    additional capital provides further funding to our business and
    we believe has improved investor perceptions with regard to our
    financial position, it has increased our equity and the number
    of actual and diluted outstanding shares of our common stock as
    well as our preferred dividend requirements, which will reduce
    our earnings per share and the return on our equity unless our
    earnings increase sufficiently.


 


    In addition, as of the end of 2008, the United States, Europe
    and Japan are all in a recession. Business activity across a
    wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and
    local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty
    due to the lack of consumer spending and



    
    28



Table of Contents




    the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Unemployment has
    increased significantly. While lower interest rates, increased
    volatility and substantial increases in trading volumes have
    positively impacted earnings in a number of our trading
    businesses, declines in asset values, the lack of liquidity,
    general uncertainty about economic and market activities and a
    lack of consumer, investor and CEO confidence have negatively
    impacted many of our other businesses, particularly our
    investment banking, merchant banking, asset management, credit
    products, mortgage, leveraged lending and equity principal
    strategies businesses. In particular, our investment banking
    business has been affected during the last twelve months by the
    decrease in equity and debt underwritings and the decline in
    both announced and completed mergers and acquisitions.


 


    Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment
    in which our businesses operate. A favorable business
    environment is generally characterized by, among other factors,
    high global gross domestic product growth, transparent, liquid
    and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and
    investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions, and strong
    business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market
    conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth,
    business activity or investor or business confidence;
    limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of
    credit and capital; increases in inflation, interest rates,
    exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic
    commodities; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical
    instability; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce
    investor confidence in capital markets; natural disasters or
    pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.


 


    Overall, during fiscal 2008, the business environment has been
    extremely adverse for many of our businesses and there can be no
    assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term.
    Until they do, we expect our results of operations to be
    adversely affected.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declining
    asset values.


 


    Many of our businesses, such as our merchant banking businesses,
    our mortgages, leveraged loan and credit products businesses in
    our FICC segment, and our equity principal strategies business,
    have net “long” positions in debt securities, loans,
    derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity) and
    most other asset classes. In addition, many of our
    market-making
    and other businesses in which we act as a principal to
    facilitate our clients’ activities, including our
    specialist businesses, commit large amounts of capital to
    maintain trading positions in interest rate and credit products,
    as well as currencies, commodities and equities. Because nearly
    all of these investing and trading positions are
    marked-to-market
    on a daily basis, declines in asset values directly and
    immediately impact our earnings, unless we have effectively
    “hedged” our exposures to such declines. In certain
    circumstances (particularly in the case of leveraged loans and
    private equities or other securities that are not freely
    tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may
    not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the
    extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly
    reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the
    assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices
    of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading
    markets for certain assets, which may make it very difficult to
    sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or
    effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in
    such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase
    our
    risk-weighted
    assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and
    increases our funding costs.


 


    In our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange
    rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing
    shares in a declining market. In markets where asset values are
    declining and in volatile markets, this results in trading
    losses and an increased need for liquidity.


 


    We receive
    asset-based
    management fees based on the value of our clients’
    portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some
    cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the
    value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the
    value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in
    turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.



    
    29



Table of Contents




    We post collateral to support our obligations and receive
    collateral to support the obligations of our clients and
    counterparties in connection with our trading businesses. When
    the value of the assets posted as collateral declines, the party
    posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral
    or, if possible, reduce its trading position. A classic example
    of such a situation is a “margin call” in connection
    with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of
    asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of
    funding trading positions is increased or the size of trading
    positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral
    this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if
    we are the party receiving collateral this can also reduce our
    profitability by reducing the level of business done with our
    clients and counterparties. In addition, volatile or less liquid
    markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets which can lead
    to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the
    level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk
    to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving
    adequate collateral.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
    disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to
    credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.


 


    Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the
    availability of credit, have adversely affected our ability to
    borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may continue to do
    so. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing
    commercial paper, promissory notes and
    long-term
    debt, or by obtaining bank loans or lines of credit. We seek to
    finance many of our assets, including our less liquid assets, on
    a secured basis, including by entering into repurchase
    agreements. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and
    more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our
    available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our
    operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to
    curtail our business activities and increase our cost of
    funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,
    particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending
    and taking principal positions, including market making.


 


    Our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on
    access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance
    their transactions. The lack of available credit and the
    increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume
    and timing of our clients’ merger and acquisition
    transactions — particularly large
    transactions — and adversely affect our financial
    advisory and underwriting businesses.


 


    In addition, we may incur significant unrealized gains or losses
    due solely to changes in our credit spreads or those of third
    parties, as these changes may affect the fair value of our
    derivative instruments and the debt securities that we hold or
    issue.


 



    Our businesses
    have been and may continue to be affected by changes in the
    levels of market volatility.


 


    Certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to
    provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in
    volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect
    the results of these businesses. On the other hand, increased
    volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,
    also increases risk as measured by VaR and may expose us to
    increased risks in connection with our
    market-making
    and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of
    these businesses in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting
    the size of our
    market-making
    positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our
    profitability, even though spreads are widening and we may earn
    more on each trade. In periods when volatility is increasing,
    but asset values are declining significantly (as has been the
    case recently), it may not be possible to sell assets at all or
    it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In such
    circumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk
    or to incur losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition,
    increases in volatility increase the level of our risk weighted

    funding costs.

    Our businesses
    have been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely
    affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among
    investors and CEOs due to general declines in economic activity
    and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market
    conditions.


 


    Our investment banking business has been and may continue to be
    adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic
    conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can
    adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO
    confidence, resulting in significant
    industry-wide
    declines in the size and number of underwritings and of
    financial advisory transactions, which could continue to have an
    adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In
    particular, because a significant portion of our investment
    banking revenues are derived from our participation in large
    transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions
    would adversely affect our investment banking business.


 


    In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines
    in market or economic activity may affect our trading businesses
    by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing
    volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even
    declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes
    or higher spreads or both.


 


    Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions,
    as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to
    transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or
    their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues,
    principally in our asset management business. To the extent that
    clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in
    products that generate less fee income.


 



    Our investing
    businesses may be affected by the poor investment performance of
    our investment products.


 


    Poor investment returns in our asset management business, due to
    either general market conditions or underperformance (against
    the performance of benchmarks or of our competitors) by funds or
    accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or
    sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to
    attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.
    This could affect the asset management and incentive fees that
    we earn on assets under management or the commissions that we
    earn for selling other investment products, such as structured
    notes or derivatives.


 


    We have in the past provided financial support to certain of our
    investment products in difficult market circumstances and, at
    our discretion, we may decide to do so in the future for
    reputational or business reasons, including through equity
    investments or cash infusions.


 



    We may incur
    losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and
    strategies.


 


    We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk
    and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but
    complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and
    legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review
    processes and other mechanisms. Our trading risk management
    process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading
    positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ
    a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk
    mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that
    accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and
    financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.
    Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.
    Recent market conditions have involved unprecedented
    dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using
    historical data to manage risk.


 


    The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures
    reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack
    thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market
    indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen
    circumstances, such as occurred during 2008, previously
    uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely
    previously correlated indicators may move in different
    directions. These types of market movements have at times
    limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have
    caused us to incur significant losses, and they



    
    31



Table of Contents




    may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can be
    exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or
    trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar
    to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce
    our risk positions due to the activity of other market
    participants or widespread market dislocations, including
    circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or
    no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we make
    investments directly through various of our businesses in
    securities, including private equity, that do not have an
    established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to
    restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce
    our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such
    positions. In addition, we invest our own capital in our
    merchant banking, alternative investment and infrastructure
    funds, and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of
    our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational
    or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control
    the risk exposures relating to these investments.


 


    For a further discussion of our risk management policies and
    procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual
    Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Our liquidity,
    profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an
    inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets
    or by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an increase in our
    credit spreads.


 


    Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity may be
    impaired by an inability to access secured
    and/or
    unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our
    subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our
    investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This
    situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable
    to control, such as a general market disruption or an
    operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by
    the perception among market participants that we, or other
    market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.


 


    The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to
    which we are a party are increasingly complex, as we employ
    structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and
    these complex structured products often do not have readily
    available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our
    investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings
    from these activities represent a significant portion of
    specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our
    positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired
    if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets
    at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other
    market crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we
    interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require
    additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions,
    which could further impair our access to liquidity.


 


    Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction
    in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
    competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our
    access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under
    certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and
    collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,
    counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with
    Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.
    Termination of our trading and collateralized financing
    contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our
    liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or
    to make significant cash payments or securities movements.


 


    Our cost of obtaining
    long-term
    unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the
    amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury
    securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same maturity
    that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our
    credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this
    funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous,
    market-driven,
    and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile
    movements. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions
    of our creditworthiness. In addition, our credit spreads may be
    influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit
    default swaps referenced to our



    
    32



Table of Contents




    long-term
    debt. The market for credit default swaps is relatively new,
    although very large, and it has proven to be extremely volatile
    and currently lacks a high degree of structure or transparency.


 



    Group Inc. is
    a holding company and is dependent for liquidity on payments
    from its subsidiaries, which are subject to
    restrictions.


 


    Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on
    dividends, distributions and other payments from its
    subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments
    on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our
    subsidiaries, including our
    broker-dealer,
    bank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws that
    restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to
    block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
    Group Inc. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could
    impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on
    its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend
    payments. In addition, Group Inc.’s right to participate in
    a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or
    reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the
    subsidiary’s creditors.


 


    Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations
    of GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GS Bank Europe, subject to
    certain exceptions, and has pledged significant assets to GS
    Bank USA to support obligations to GS Bank USA. These guarantees
    may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to
    its subsidiaries or their creditors and counterparties at a time
    when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own
    obligations. See “Business — Regulation” in
    Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Our
    businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely
    affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults
    by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets
    or whose securities or obligations we hold.


 


    The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been
    increasing over the past several years, as have the breadth and
    size of the entities to which we have credit exposures. We are
    exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,
    securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.
    These parties may default on their obligations to us due to
    bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
    reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even
    concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to
    significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other
    institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.


 


    We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third
    parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In
    addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties
    whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses
    and/or
    adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use
    those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A
    significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our
    counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.
    While in many cases we are permitted to require additional
    collateral from counterparties that experience financial
    difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we
    are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The
    termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may
    subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.
    Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to
    the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of
    market stress and illiquidity.


 


    As part of our clearing business, we finance our client
    positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or
    misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly review credit
    exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific
    industries, countries and regions that we believe may present
    credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or
    circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.

    Concentration
    of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses.


 


    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant
    losses in our
    market-making,
    proprietary trading, investing, block trading, merchant banking,
    underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to
    the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing
    businesses or commit capital to facilitate client-driven
    business. The number and size of such transactions may affect
    our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because
    of concentration of risk, we may suffer losses even when
    economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our
    competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it
    difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or
    economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part
    of our credit origination activities. Our inability to reduce
    our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these
    positions, including during periods of market stress, could
    negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in
    the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency
    or bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues
    associated with selling such securities or loans.


 


    In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a
    concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,
    borrower or issuer, and a failure or downgrade of, or default
    by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps
    materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor
    the level of our credit exposure to individual entities,
    industries and countries may not function as we have
    anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different
    industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high
    volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial
    services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial
    banks, and investment funds. This has resulted in significant
    credit concentration with respect to this industry.


 



    The financial
    services industry is highly competitive.


 


    The financial services industry — and all of our
    businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect
    them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of
    factors, including transaction execution, our products and
    services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price.
    Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and
    convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
    This trend accelerated over the course of the past year as a
    result of numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry
    participants. This trend has also hastened the globalization of
    the securities and other financial services markets. As a
    result, we have had to commit capital to support our
    international operations and to execute large global
    transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas
    and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more
    experience and more established relationships with clients,
    regulators and industry participants in the relevant market,
    which could adversely affect our ability to expand.


 


    Pricing and other competitive pressures in our investment
    banking business, as well as our other businesses, have
    continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of
    our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing
    prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and
    other assignments, we have experienced pressure to extend and
    price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us
    for the risks we take.


 



    We face
    enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact
    with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us
    to new asset classes and new markets.


 


    A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and
    expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,
    directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are
    not within our traditional client and counterparty base and
    expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business
    activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks
    associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational
    concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated
    counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of
    these activities, increased
    credit-related,
    sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or
    acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in
    which these assets are being operated or held.



    
    34



Table of Contents





    Derivative
    transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential
    losses.


 


    We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,
    including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative
    instruments are individually negotiated and
    non-standardized,
    which can make exiting, transferring or settling the position
    difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to
    the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other
    obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we
    do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation
    and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or
    other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments
    due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays
    with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as
    increased costs to the firm.


 


    Derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with
    third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on
    a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we
    are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the
    event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the
    contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivative
    products are created, covering a wider array of underlying
    credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the
    underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability
    to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and
    subject us to increased costs. Any regulatory effort to create
    an exchange or trading platform for credit derivatives and other
    OTC derivative contracts, or a market shift toward standardized
    derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with such
    transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit
    our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of
    our clients and ourselves and adversely affect our profitability.


 



    A failure in
    our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third
    parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses,
    result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our
    reputation and cause losses.


 


    Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process
    and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of
    transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous
    and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as
    well as the information technology services we provide to
    clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as
    well as legal and regulatory standards. As our client base and
    our geographical reach expands, developing and maintaining our
    operational systems and infrastructure becomes increasingly
    challenging. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other
    operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or
    become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or
    partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction
    volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these
    transactions or provide these services. In addition, we also
    face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity
    constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing
    houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate
    our securities transactions, and as our interconnectivity with
    our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational
    failure with respect to our clients’ systems. In recent
    years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing
    agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has increased our
    exposure to operational failure, termination or capacity
    constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we
    use and could affect our ability to find adequate and
    cost-effective
    alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or
    constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market
    participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of
    operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be
    integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the
    interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with
    central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the risk
    that an operational failure at one institution may cause an
    industry-wide
    operational failure that could materially impact our ability to
    conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint
    could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions,
    service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our
    businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our
    clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our
    businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.

    Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,
    our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
    disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses
    and the communities in which we are located. This may include a
    disruption involving electrical, communications, internet,
    transportation or other services used by us or third parties
    with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a
    result of events that affect only our buildings or the buildings
    of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader
    impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those
    buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees in our
    primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area,
    London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, work in close
    proximity to one another, in one or more buildings.
    Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity,
    given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our
    employees are in the New York metropolitan area, depending on
    the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event
    impacting our New York metropolitan area offices could very
    negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one
    location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy
    our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations,
    our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer,
    and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency
    plans that depend on communication or travel.


 


    Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
    transmission of confidential and other information in our
    computer systems and networks. Although we take protective
    measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,
    our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to
    unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code
    and other events that could have a security impact. If one or
    more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our
    or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and
    other information processed and stored in, and transmitted
    through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
    interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, our
    counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which
    could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We
    may be required to expend significant additional resources to
    modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate
    vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to
    litigation and financial losses that are either not insured
    against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by
    us.


 


    We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and
    proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We
    have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service
    providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop
    secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be
    unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our
    clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other
    third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third
    parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the
    confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or
    mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information
    being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service
    provider, counterparty or other third party could result in
    legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.


 



    Conflicts of
    interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify
    and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our
    businesses.


 


    As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client
    base, we increasingly must address potential conflicts of
    interest, including situations where our services to a
    particular client or our own investments or other interests
    conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of
    another client, as well as situations where one or more of our
    businesses have access to material
    non-public
    information that may not be shared with other businesses within
    the firm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity
    with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.


 


    Our regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for
    potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed
    examinations of specific transactions. Our status as a bank
    holding company subjects us to heightened regulation and
    increased regulatory scrutiny by the Federal Reserve Board with
    respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and entities that
    are or could be seen as affiliates of ours.



    
    36



Table of Contents




    We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to
    identify and address conflicts of interest, including those
    designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among
    our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing
    with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our
    reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be
    damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into
    transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be
    affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and deal
    appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential
    or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or
    enforcement actions.


 



    Our businesses
    and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive
    regulation around the world.


 


    As a participant in the financial services industry, we are
    subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the
    world. We face the risk of significant intervention by
    regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct
    our businesses. Among other things, we could be fined,
    prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or
    subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.


 


    In recent years, firms in the financial services industry have
    been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. The
    industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of
    regulators, both within and outside the United States. Penalties
    and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased
    substantially over the last several years, and certain
    regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence
    enforcement actions.


 


    In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement
    of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or
    those of our clients may adversely affect our businesses. Recent
    market disruptions have led to numerous proposals for changes in
    the regulation of the financial services industry, including
    significant additional regulation. Regulatory changes could lead
    to business disruptions, could impact the value of assets that
    we hold or the scope or profitability of our business
    activities, could require us to change certain of our business
    practices and could expose us to additional costs (including
    compliance costs) and liabilities as well as reputational harm,
    and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the
    activities of financial services firms, make it more difficult
    for us to distinguish ourselves from competitors. For a
    discussion of the extensive regulation to which our businesses
    are subject, see “Business — Regulation” in
    Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    Our status as a bank holding company and the operation of our
    lending and other businesses through GS Bank USA subject us to
    additional regulation and limitations on our activities, as
    described in “Business — Regulation —
    Banking Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of our
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    as well as some regulatory uncertainty as we apply banking
    regulations and practices to many of our businesses. The
    application of these regulations and practices may present us
    and our regulators with new or novel issues.


 


    Our firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements at a
    number of levels, as described above under
    “Business — Regulation” in Part I,
    Item 1 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    As a bank holding company, we will be subject to capital
    requirements based on Basel I as opposed to the requirements
    based on Basel II that applied to us as a CSE. Complying with
    these requirements may require us to liquidate assets or raise
    capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs
    or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.
    In addition, failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
    initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary
    actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
    material adverse effect on our financial condition.


 



    Our agreements
    with the U.S. Treasury and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. impose
    restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to
    increase dividends, repurchase our common stock or preferred
    stock and access the equity capital markets.


 


    In October 2008, we issued preferred stock and a warrant to
    purchase our common stock to the U.S. Treasury as part of
    its TARP Capital Purchase Program. Prior to
    October 28, 2011, unless we have redeemed all of the
    preferred stock or the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of
    the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the
    U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other
    things,

    increase our common stock dividend or repurchase our common
    stock or other preferred stock (with certain exceptions,
    including the repurchase of our common stock to offset share
    dilution from
    equity-based
    employee compensation awards). We have also granted registration
    rights and offering facilitation rights to the
    U.S. Treasury and to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. pursuant to
    which we have agreed to
    lock-up
    periods during which we would be unable to issue equity
    securities.


 



    Substantial
    legal liability or significant regulatory action against us
    could have material adverse financial effects or cause us
    significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously
    harm our business prospects.


 


    We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the
    volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial
    institutions remain high. See “Legal Proceedings” in
    Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are
    involved. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers
    and clients increase in a market downturn. In addition,
    employment-related claims typically increase in periods when we
    have reduced the total number of employees.


 


    There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
    fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
    industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee
    misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or
    prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to
    prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
    cases.


 



    The growth of
    electronic trading and the introduction of new technology may
    adversely affect our business and may increase
    competition.


 


    Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The
    growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new
    technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with
    new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are
    increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems
    and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears
    that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue
    and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading
    systems compete with our trading businesses, including our
    specialist businesses, and we may experience continued
    competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the
    increased use by our clients of
    low-cost
    electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to
    trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and
    spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade
    directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of
    their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. The
    NYSE’s adoption and continued refinement of its hybrid
    market for trading securities may increase pressure on our
    Equities business as clients execute more of their NYSE-related
    trades electronically. We have invested significant resources
    into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to
    continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues
    generated by these systems will yield an adequate return on our
    investment, particularly given the relatively lower commissions
    arising from electronic trades.


 



    Our businesses
    may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain
    qualified employees.


 


    Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability
    to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our
    businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and
    geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new employees
    and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition
    from within the financial services industry and from businesses
    outside the financial services industry for qualified employees
    has often been intense. This is particularly the case in
    emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified
    employees with entities that have a significantly greater
    presence or more extensive experience in the region.

    In fiscal 2008, we significantly reduced compensation levels. In
    addition, the market price of our shares of our common stock
    declined very significantly during the year. A substantial
    portion of our annual bonus compensation paid to our senior
    employees has in recent years been paid in the form of
    equity-based
    awards. In addition, we reduced the number of employees across
    nearly all of our businesses during the latter portion of the
    year. The combination of these events could adversely affect our
    ability to hire and retain qualified employees.


 



    Our power
    generation interests and related activities subject us to
    extensive regulation, as well as environmental and other risks
    associated with power generation activities.


 


    The power generation facilities that we own and those that we
    operate, as well as our other power-related activities, are
    subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
    energy, environmental and other governmental laws and
    regulations, including environmental laws and regulations
    relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste
    management, natural resources, site remediation and health and
    safety.


 


    We may incur substantial costs (including being required to
    cease or curtail operations of one or more of our power
    generation facilities) in complying with current or future laws
    and regulations relating to electric power generation and
    wholesale sales and trading of electricity and natural gas,
    including having to commit significant capital toward
    environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control
    equipment, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes,
    and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses at our
    power generation facilities. Our power generation facilities are
    also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events,
    many of which are outside of our control, including breakdown or
    failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or
    other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency,
    terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other hostile or
    catastrophic events. In addition, these facilities could be
    adversely affected by the failure of any of our third party
    suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual
    obligations, including the failure to obtain raw materials
    necessary for operation at reasonable prices. Market conditions
    or other factors could cause a failure to satisfy or obtain
    waivers under agreements with third parties, including lenders
    and utilities, which impose significant obligations on our
    subsidiaries that own such facilities. In addition, we may not
    have insurance against the risks that such facilities face or
    the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.


 


    The occurrence of any of such events may prevent the affected
    facilities from performing under applicable power sales
    agreements, may impair their operations or financial results and
    may result in litigation or other reputational harm.


 



    In conducting
    our businesses around the world, we are subject to political,
    economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent
    in operating in many countries.


 


    In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to risks of possible
    nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital
    controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
    actions, as well the outbreak of hostilities or acts of
    terrorism. In many countries, the laws and regulations
    applicable to the securities and financial services industries
    and many of the transactions in which we are involved are
    uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to
    determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market.
    Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in
    compliance with the application of local laws in a particular
    market or our failure to develop effective working relationships
    with local regulators could have a significant and negative
    effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our
    reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk
    that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable
    in all cases.


 


    Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into
    new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets,
    and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging market

    countries have experienced severe economic and financial
    disruptions, including significant devaluations of their
    currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt,
    capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative
    growth rates in their economies, as well as military activity or
    acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of these
    conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and
    increased volatility in financial markets generally.


 



    We may incur
    losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events,
    including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or
    natural disasters.


 


    The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including
    the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency
    (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),
    terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic
    and financial disruptions, could lead to operational
    difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair
    our ability to manage our businesses, and could expose our
    insurance subsidiaries to significant losses.
