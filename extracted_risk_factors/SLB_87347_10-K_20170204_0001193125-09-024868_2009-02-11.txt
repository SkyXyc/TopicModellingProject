STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  The current global credit and economic environment has reduced worldwide demand for energy
and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices. A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices can reduce our customers’ activities and their spending on our services and products. Demand for the majority
of our services substantially depends on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and
generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices. As the worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets has deepened in recent months, demand for oil and gas has reduced dramatically and oil and gas prices
have fallen sharply, causing some of our customers to start to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending. This has started to reduce the demand for our services and has begun to exert downward pressure on the prices that
we charge. If economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it could result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for our services and products.
This could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict how long the economic downturn will continue, to what extent it will worsen, and to what extent this will continue to affect us.
 The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced
availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing due to the tightening of the credit markets, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or
cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our suppliers could be negatively
impacted by current global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a
significant increase in the price of supplies, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  The prices for oil and
natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors, including:   


 
·
 
 demand for energy, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic development and general economic and business conditions;
  


 
·
 
 the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;  <P

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the
approximately 80 countries in which we operate.    Our non-United States
operations accounted for approximately 78% of our consolidated revenue in 2008, 76% in 2007 and 73% in 2006. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:  <P

economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations.  If any of the risks described
above materialize, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.  We are also subject to risks related to investment
in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the
market for our common stock.    Environmental compliance costs and liabilities
could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.    We are
subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges
and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive, complex and
stringent. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of
the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of
existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that
could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.   
We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our results and financial condition.  <P

personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against
losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to
increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.  <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products,
this could affect any competitive advantage we hold.    If we are unable to
develop and produce competitive technology or deliver them to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could materially reduce our operating revenue and net income.
   Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights,
including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.    <FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted United States patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be
adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be
able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets.    <P

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services
may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties,
if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service, which would reduce our operating revenue. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would
increase our costs.    Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical
personnel could impede our operations.    We require highly skilled personnel
to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and
retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.    <P

addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our operating
revenue.
