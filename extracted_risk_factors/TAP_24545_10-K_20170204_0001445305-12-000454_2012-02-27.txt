Item 1A Risk Factors and the discussions regarding our Canada, U.K. and MCI segments.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated or segmented sales in 2011, 2010 or 2009.Our ProductsWe have a diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands, including signature brands Coors Light, Molson Canadian and Carling, which are positioned to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.Brands sold in Canada include Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Molson Export, Molson Canadian 67, Molson Dry, Molson M, Rickard's Red, Rickard's Blonde and other Rickard's brands, Carling, Carling Black Label, Pilsner, Keystone, Creemore Springs, the Granville Island brands, Caffrey's, Cobra, and a number of other regional brands. We also brew or distribute under license the following brands: Heineken, Amstel Light, and Murphy's under license from Heineken N.V. ("Heineken"), Asahi and Asahi Select under license from Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller Chill, Milwaukee's Best, and Milwaukee's Best Dry under license from SABMiller, and Foster's under license from Foster's Group Limited ("Fosters"). We are also party to a joint venture with Grupo Modelo S.A.B. de C.V. ("Modelo"), which imports, distributes and markets the Modelo beer brand portfolio, including the Corona, Coronita, Negra Modelo, and Pacifico brands, across all Canadian provinces and territories.MillerCoors sells a wide variety of brands in the U.S. Its flagship premium light brands are Coors Light and Miller Lite. Brands in the domestic premium segment include Coors Banquet, Miller Genuine Draft, and Miller 64. Brands in the domestic super premium segment include Miller Chill and Sparks. Brands in the below premium segment include Miller High Life, Keystone, Icehouse, Mickey's, Milwaukee's Best, Hamm's, and Old English 800 brands. MillerCoors also brews or distributes under license the Molson and Foster's brands and George Killian's Irish Red. Craft and import brands, marketed and sold through Tenth and Blake, include the Blue Moon brands, Henry Weinhard's brands, Leinenkugel's brands, Peroni Nastro 3Table of ContentsAzzurro, Pilsner Urquell, Batch 19 and Grolsch. Brands in the non-alcoholic segment include Coors Non-Alcoholic and Sharp's. MCBC and SABMiller assigned the United States and Puerto Rican ownership rights to their legacy brands to MillerCoors, but retained all ownership of these brands outside the United States and Puerto Rico.Brands sold in the U.K. include: Carling, C2, Carling Chrome, Coors Light, Worthington's, White Shield, Red Shield, Caffrey's, Sharp's Doom Bar, Animée, and Blue Moon, as well as a number of smaller regional ale brands. We also sell the Grolsch brands through a joint venture with Royal Grolsch N.V. and the Cobra brands through a joint venture called Cobra Beer Partnership Ltd., ("Cobra U.K.") and are the exclusive distributor for several brands which are sold under license, including Corona, Coronita, Negra Modelo, Pacifico, and Singha. Additionally, in order to be able to provide a full line of beer and other beverages to our on-premise customers, we sell "factored" brands, including wines in our U.K. segment, which are third party brands for which we provide distribution to retail, typically on a non-exclusive basis.MCI also markets and sells several of our brands in its international markets. Brands unique to these international markets include Zima, Si'hai, Coors Gold, and Coors Extra.Canada SegmentWe are Canada's second largest brewer by volume and North America's oldest beer company. Our approximate market share of the Canada beer market at the end of 2011 was 40%. We brew, market, sell and distribute a wide variety of beer brands nationally. Our portfolio has leading brands in all major product and price segments. Our focus and investment is on key owned brands, including Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Carling, Molson Dry, Molson Export, Rickard's, Pilsner, Creemore Springs and Granville Island and key strategic distribution partnerships, including those with Heineken, Modelo and SABMiller. In 2011, Coors Light had an approximate 14% market share and was the top selling beer brand in Canada and Molson Canadian had an approximate 8% market share and was the third largest selling beer in Canada.The Canada segment also includes our partnership arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario, Brewers' Retail Inc. ("BRI"), and in the Western provinces, Brewers' Distributor Ltd. ("BDL"). BRI and BDL are currently accounted for under the equity method of accounting. BRI was consolidated in our financial statements until March 1, 2009, when it was deconsolidated. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4 "Investments" of the Notes for further discussion.Sales and DistributionIn Canada, provincial governments regulate the beer industry, particularly with regard to the pricing, mark-up, container management, sale, distribution, and advertising of beer. Distribution and the retail sale of alcohol products involve a wide range and varied degree of Canadian government control through their respective provincial liquor boards.Province of OntarioIn Ontario, beer may only be purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI, at government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, at approved agents of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, or at any bar, restaurant, or tavern licensed by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to sell liquor for on-premise consumption. We, together with certain other brewers, participate in the ownership of BRI in proportion to provincial market share relative to other brewers in the ownership group. Brewers may deliver directly to BRI's outlets or may choose to use BRI's distribution centers to access retail stores in Ontario, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario system and licensed establishments.Province of QuébecIn Québec, beer is distributed directly by each brewer or through independent agents. We are the agent for the licensed brands we distribute. The brewer or agent distributes the products to permit holders for retail sales for on-premise consumption. Québec retail sales for off-premise consumption are made through grocery and convenience stores as well as government operated outlets.Province of British ColumbiaIn British Columbia, the government's Liquor Distribution Branch controls the regulatory elements of distribution of all alcohol products in the province. BDL which we co-own with a competitor, manages the distribution of our products throughout British Columbia. Consumers can purchase beer at any Liquor Distribution Branch retail outlet, at any independently owned and licensed retail store or at any licensed establishment for on-premise consumption. Establishments licensed primarily for on-premise liquor sales may also be licensed for off-premise consumption.Province of AlbertaIn Alberta, the distribution of beer is managed by independent private warehousing and shipping companies or by a 4Table of Contentsgovernment sponsored system in the case of U.S. sourced products. All sales of liquor in Alberta are made through retail outlets licensed by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission or licensees, such as bars, hotels and restaurants. BDL manages the distribution of our products in Alberta.Other ProvincesOur products are distributed in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan through local liquor boards. Manitoba and Saskatchewan also have licensed private retailers. BDL manages the distribution of our products in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In the Maritime Provinces (other than Newfoundland), local liquor boards distribute and sell our products. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut manage distribution and sell through government liquor commissioners.Manufacturing, Production and PackagingBrewing Raw MaterialsWe select global suppliers in order to procure the highest quality materials and services at the lowest prices available. We also use hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of volatility in certain commodities and foreign exchange markets.We source barley malt from two primary providers. Hops are purchased from a variety of global suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and New Zealand. Other starch brewing adjuncts are sourced from two main suppliers, both in North America. We do not foresee any significant risk of disruption in the supply of these agricultural products. Water used in the brewing process is from local sources in the communities where our breweries operate. We do not anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products.Brewing and Packaging FacilitiesWe operate seven breweries, strategically located throughout Canada, which brew, bottle, package, market and distribute all owned and certain licensed brands sold in and exported from Canada. See Item 2, "Properties" for further detail.Packaging MaterialsWe single source glass bottles and aluminum cans and have a committed supply through 2014 and 2016, respectively. Availability of glass bottles and aluminum cans has not been an issue, and we do not expect any difficulties in accessing them in the future. The distribution systems in each province generally provide the collection network for returnable bottles and aluminum cans. The standard container for beer brewed in Canada is the 341 ml returnable bottle, which in 2011 represented a significant majority of the approximately 51% of bottle volume sales in Canada. In 2011, aluminum cans accounted for approximately 39% of volume sales in Canada. In 2011, we sold approximately 10% of our beer volume in stainless steel kegs. A limited number of kegs are purchased every year, and we have no long-term supply commitment. Crowns, labels, corrugate, and paperboard are purchased from a small number of sources unique to each product. We do not foresee difficulties in accessing these packaging products in the near future.Contract ManufacturingWe have an agreement with North American Breweries to brew, package and ship Labatt trademark brands to the U.S. market through 2016.Seasonality of BusinessConsumption of beer in Canada is seasonal, with approximately 39% of our sales volume occurring during the four months from May through August 2011, which is consistent with our historical results.Known Trends and Competitive Conditions2011 Canada Beer Industry OverviewThe Canadian brewing industry is a mature market. It is characterized by aggressive competition for volume and market share from regional brewers, microbrewers and certain foreign brewers, as well as our main domestic competitor. These competitive pressures require significant annual investment in marketing and selling activities.There are three major beer price segments: above premium, which includes most imports; premium, which includes the majority of domestic brands and the light sub-segment; and value (below premium).Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has gradually lost volume to the above premium and value segments. For each of the five years ended December 31, 2008, Canada beer industry shipments annual average growth rate approximated 1%. For each of the two years ended December 31, 2010, there were slight declines and for the year ended December 31, 2011, 5Table of Contentsthere was an approximate decline of 1.5% in Canada beer industry shipments.Our Competitive PositionOur brands compete with competitor beer brands and other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer segments.The Canada brewing industry is comprised principally of two major brewers, MCBC and Anheuser-Busch InBev ("ABI"), whose combined market share in 2011 was approximately 82% of beer sold in Canada. In 2011, the Ontario and Québec markets accounted for approximately 62% of the total beer market in Canada.RegulationIn Canada, provincial governments regulate the production, marketing, distribution, selling, and pricing of beer (including the establishment of minimum prices), and impose commodity taxes and license fees in relation to the production and sale of beer. In addition, the federal government regulates the advertising, labeling, quality control, and international trade of beer, and also imposes commodity taxes, consumption taxes, excise taxes, and in certain instances, custom duties on imported beer. In 2011, our Canada excise taxes totaled $665.5 million or approximately $75 per hectoliter sold. Further, certain bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government, provincial governments and certain foreign governments, especially with the United States, affect the Canadian beer industry.United States SegmentEffective July 1, 2008, MCBC and SABMiller formed MillerCoors to combine their respective U.S. and Puerto Rico operations. Each party contributed its business and related operating assets and certain liabilities. The percentage interests in the profits of MillerCoors are 58% for SABMiller and 42% for MCBC. Voting interests are shared 50%-50%, and MCBC and SABMiller have equal board representation within MillerCoors. MCBC and SABMiller each agreed not to transfer its economic or voting interests in MillerCoors for a period of five years from the date of combination, and certain rights of first refusal apply to any subsequent assignment. Our interest in MillerCoors is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.Prior to the formation of MillerCoors, we produced, marketed, and sold the MCBC portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories, and our U.S. operating segment included the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Container ("RMMC") and Rocky Mountain Bottle Container ("RMBC") joint ventures. Effective July 1, 2008, MCBC's equity investment in MillerCoors represents our U.S. operating segment.Sales and DistributionIn the United States, beer is generally distributed through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. A national network of approximately 450 independent distributors purchases MillerCoors' products and distributes them to retail accounts. In 2011, approximately 18% was sold on-premise in bars and restaurants, and the other 82% was sold off-premise in convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores and other retail outlets. MillerCoors wholly owns one distributorship, which handled less than 1% of its total volume in 2011.Manufacturing, Production and PackagingBrewing Raw MaterialsMillerCoors uses the highest quality ingredients to brew its products. MillerCoors malts a portion of its production requirements, using barley purchased under yearly contracts from independent farmers located in the western United States. Other barley, malt, and cereal grains are purchased from suppliers primarily in the U.S. Hops are purchased from suppliers in the U.S., New Zealand and certain European countries. MillerCoors has water rights to provide for and to sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought in the regions for which it has operations. MillerCoors does not anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products.Brewing and Packaging FacilitiesThere are eight major breweries/packaging facilities which produce MillerCoors products. MillerCoors imports Molson brands from MCBC and Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Pilsner Urquell, Grolsch, and other import brands from SABMiller.Packaging MaterialsOver half of U.S. products sold were packaged in aluminum cans in 2011. A portion of aluminum cans were purchased 6Table of Contentsfrom RMMC, a joint venture with Ball Corporation ("Ball"), whose production facilities are located near the brewery in Golden, Colorado. In addition to the supply agreement with RMMC, MillerCoors has a commercial supply agreement with Ball to purchase cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through RMMC; these agreements have various expiration dates. The RMMC joint venture agreement was scheduled to expire at the end of 2011, however, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MillerCoors signed a 10-year contract extension with Ball to extend the RMMC joint venture agreement along with the commercial can and end purchase agreements. Approximately one-third of U.S. products in 2011 were packaged in glass bottles of which a portion was provided by RMBC, a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc ("Owens"). The joint venture with Owens, as well as a supply agreement with Owens for the glass bottles required in excess of RMBC's production, expires in 2015. The approximate remaining 10% of U.S. production volume sold in 2011 was packaged in half, quarter, and one-sixth barrel stainless steel kegs. A limited number of kegs are purchased each year, and there is no long-term supply agreement. Crowns, labels, corrugate and paperboard are purchased from a small number of sources unique to each product. MillerCoors does not foresee difficulties in accessing packaging products in the future.Contract ManufacturingMillerCoors has an agreement to brew, package and ship products for Pabst Brewing Company through June 2020. Additionally, MillerCoors produces beer under contract for our MCI segment, SABMiller and Foster's LLC.Seasonality of the BusinessMillerCoors U.S. sales volumes are normally lowest in the winter months (first and fourth quarters) and highest in the summer months (second and third quarters).Known Trends and Competitive Conditions2011 U.S. Beer Industry OverviewThe beer industry in the United States is highly competitive, and the two largest brewers, of which MillerCoors is the smaller, represent approximately 77% of the market. The creation of MillerCoors created a stronger U.S. brewer with the scale, operational efficiency and distribution platform to compete more effectively in the U.S. market place. Growing or even maintaining market share has required significant investments in marketing. For the ten years ended December 31, 2008, the U.S. beer industry shipments annual growth rate approximated 1%, compared with declines ranging from 1% to 2% in each of the years 2009 to 2011. The decline in the U.S. beer industry has been partially attributed to relatively poor economic conditions. High rates of unemployment and lower consumer confidence have negatively affected the legal age key beer drinkers' purchasing behaviors. Our Competitive PositionThe MillerCoors portfolio of beers competes with numerous above premium, premium, low-calorie, popular priced, non-alcoholic, and imported brands. These competing brands are produced by international, national, regional and local brewers. MillerCoors competes most directly with ABI, but also competes with imported and craft beer brands. MillerCoors is the nation's second largest brewer by volume, selling approximately 29% of the total 2011 U.S. brewing industry shipments (including exports and U.S. shipments of imports). This compares to ABI's estimated market share of 48%.MillerCoors' products also compete with other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus their competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Driven by increased spirits advertising along with increased wine and spirits execution, sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beers in recent years resulting in a reduction in the beer segment's lead in the overall alcohol beverage market.RegulationThe U.S. beer business is regulated by federal, state, and local governments. These regulations govern many parts of MillerCoors' operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales, and environmental issues. To operate their facilities, MillerCoors must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department; Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau; the U.S. Department of Agriculture; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; state alcohol regulatory agencies; and state and federal environmental agencies.Governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. U.S. federal excise taxes on malt beverages approximated $15 per hectoliter in 2011. Based on state law, state excise taxes are levied in specific states at varying rates with an average rate of approximately $1 per hectoliter in 2011.7Table of ContentsUnited Kingdom SegmentWe are the United Kingdom's second largest brewer by volume with an approximate 19% share (excluding factored products), in 2011, of the U.K. beer market, Western Europe's second largest market. Sales are primarily in England and Wales, with Carling representing approximately 75% of our total U.K. segment beer volume. The U.K. segment consists of our production and sale of the MCBC brands in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch brands in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of the Cobra brands in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies, but sold and delivered to retail by us), and our Tradeteam joint venture arrangement with DHL (formerly Exel Logistics) for the distribution of products throughout the U.K. Additionally, we distribute the Modelo brands, including Corona, pursuant to a distribution agreement with Modelo.Sales and DistributionIn the U.K., beer is generally distributed through a two-tier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers. Most of our beer in the U.K. is sold directly to retailers. It is also common in the U.K. for brewers to distribute beer, wine, spirits, and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel (bars and restaurants). Approximately 27% of our U.K. segment net sales in 2011 represent factored brands. Factored brand sales are included in our net sales and cost of goods, but are not included in our reported volumes.Generally, over the past three decades, volumes have shifted from the higher margin on-premise channel, where products are consumed in pubs and restaurants, to the lower margin off-premise channel, also referred to as the "take-home" market.On-Premise ChannelThe on-premise channel accounted for approximately 63% of our U.K. sales volumes in 2011. The on-premise channel has two sub-categories: multiple on-premise and independent on-premise. Multiple on-premise refers to those customers who own a number of pubs and restaurants and independent on-premise refers to individual owner-operators of pubs and restaurants. In 2011, approximately 49% and 51% of our on-premise volume represents multiple (including national wholesalers) and independent on-premise customers, respectively. In recent years, pricing competition in the on-premise channel has intensified as the retail pub chains have consolidated. As a result, the larger pub chains have been able to negotiate lower beer prices from brewers.The installation and maintenance of draught beer dispensing equipment in the on-premise channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer. Accordingly, we own equipment used to dispense beer from kegs to consumers. This includes beer lines, cooling equipment, taps, and counter mounts.Similar to other U.K. brewers, we utilize loans in securing supply relationships with customers in the on-premise market. Loans are normally granted at below-market rates of interest, with the outlet purchasing beer at lower-than-average discount levels to compensate. We reclassify a portion of sales revenue to interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes for further discussion.Off-Premise ChannelThe off-premise channel accounted for approximately 37% of our U.K. sales volume in 2011. The off-premise channel includes sales to supermarkets, convenience stores, liquor stores, distributors, and wholesalers. The off-premise channel has become increasingly concentrated among a small number of super-store chains, placing increasing downward pressure on pricing.DistributionDistribution activities for both the on- and off-premise channels are conducted by Tradeteam, which operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet.Manufacturing, Production and PackagingBrewing Raw MaterialsWe use the highest quality water, barley and hops to brew our products. During 2011, we produced 100% of our required malt using U.K. sourced barley. Hops and adjunct starches used in the brewing process are purchased from agricultural sources in the U.K., U.S. and on the European continent. Water used in the brewing process is sourced from various wells that have sufficient recharge capacity for assumed production. We do not anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products.8Table of ContentsBrewing and Packaging FacilitiesWe operate four breweries in the U.K which brew, bottle, package and distribute all owned brands sold in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland with the exception of Coors Light, which is contract brewed in the Republic of Ireland. See "Contract Manufacturing" and Item 2, "Properties" for further detail.Packaging MaterialsWe used kegs and casks for approximately 52% of our U.K. products in 2011, reflecting a high percentage of product sold on-premise. Approximately 36% of our U.K. products were packaged in steel cans with aluminum ends in 2011. All of our cans are purchased through a supply contract with Ball. Approximately 12% of our U.K. products are packaged in glass bottles purchased through supply contracts with third-party suppliers. Crowns, labels, corrugate, and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. We do not foresee difficulties in accessing these or other packaging materials in the foreseeable future.Contract ManufacturingWe have a contract brewing and kegging agreement with Heineken for the Fosters and Kronenbourg brands. We also have an agreement with Heineken whereby it will brew and package certain of our products for sale in the Republic of Ireland through December 2014. In addition, we agreed to a multi-year agreement to contract brew ales for Carlsberg Group ("Carlsberg") which began in 2011.Seasonality of BusinessIn the U.K., the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations primarily influenced by holidays, weather and by certain major televised sporting events. Peak selling seasons occur during the summer and during the Christmas and New Year holidays.Known Trends and Competitive Conditions2011 U.K. Beer Industry OverviewThe U.K. beer market in 2011 declined by 4.2%, with the on-premise declining 5.0% and the off-premise decreasing 3.5%, impacted by poor summer weather, poor economic conditions and excise tax increases in excess of general inflation. A widening price differential between the on-premise (higher prices) and the off-premise (lower prices) has tended to benefit off-premise sales. The recession has accelerated the downward pricing trend. For each of the ten years ended December 31, 2007, U.K. beer industry shipments declined at an average rate of between 1% and 2%, compared with declines of approximately 4% in the years 2008 to 2011. The industry has also experienced a steady trend away from ales and toward lagers. Sales of lagers accounted for 76% of the U.K. market in 2011.Our Competitive PositionOur beers compete not only with similar products from competitors, but also with other alcohol beverages, including wines, spirits, and ciders. With the exception of stout, where we do not have our own brand, our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer categories. Our strength in the growing lager category with Carling, Grolsch, Coors Light, Corona and Cobra positions us well to take advantage of the continuing trend toward lagers. Our portfolio has been strengthened by the introduction of a range of imported and specialty beer brands, such as Singha, Blue Moon, Animée and Sharp's Doom Bar.Our principal competitors are Heineken, ABI, and Carlsberg, with market shares in 2011 of approximately 24%, 18%, and 14%, respectively, compared to our share of 19%.RegulationU.K. regulations apply to many parts of our operations and products, including brewing, food safety, labeling and packaging, marketing and advertising, environmental, health and safety, employment, and data protection regulations. To operate our breweries and carry on business in the U.K., we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and licenses from local Licensing Justices and governmental bodies, including Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs; the Office of Fair Trading; the Data Protection Commissioner and the Environment Agency.The U.K. government levies excise taxes on all alcohol beverages at varying rates depending on the type of product and its alcohol content by volume. In 2011, our excise taxes totaled $967.6 million or $106 per hectoliter. In 2010, the U.K. 9Table of Contentsgovernment announced that alcohol excise tax rates will increase at a rate of 2% above U.K. inflation annually through 2015.Molson Coors International SegmentThe objective of MCI is to grow and expand our business and brand portfolios in our non-core and emerging markets. Our current business is in Asia, continental Europe, Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Puerto Rico as it is a part of the U.S. segment).AsiaThe MCI Asia region is primarily composed of businesses in China, Japan and India, with increasing focus in the Philippines and Vietnam markets. The Japan business is focused on the Zima and Coors Light brands. Additionally, in January 2011, our Japan business began selling the Corona brands pursuant to a distribution agreement with Modelo completed in November 2010. In September 2010, a joint venture agreement was finalized in China with Hebei Si'hai Beer Company, giving us a 51% share of the newly formed Molson Coors Si'hai Brewing (China) Co., Ltd. ("MC Si'hai"). In June 2011, a joint venture agreement was finalized in India with Cobra India, giving us a 51% share and operational control of the newly formed Molson Coors Cobra India ("MC Cobra India"). MC Cobra India produces, sells and markets a beer portfolio consisting of King Cobra, King Cobra Superior and Iceberg 9000. The results of both MC Si'hai and MC Cobra India are consolidated in our financial statements.EuropeOur business within continental Europe is focused on growing Carling, Coors Light and Cobra. These products are brewed by and exported from our U.K. breweries to portions of continental Europe. In 2011, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Obolon CJSC for manufacturing and distribution of Carling in Ukraine. In 2010, related to our business in Spain, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Mahou San Miguel for manufacturing and distribution of Coors and distribution of Carling. In 2010, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Moscow Brewing Company for manufacturing and distribution of Coors Light in Russia.Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Other        Coors Light is sold in Mexico through an exclusive licensing agreement with Heineken. In the Caribbean and Latin America, our products are produced under a brewing agreement with MillerCoors and are exported to and sold through agreements with independent distributors. CorporateCorporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to any of the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relate to worldwide administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, finance and accounting, treasury, insurance and risk management. Additionally, the results of our water resources and energy operations in Colorado are included in Corporate. Corporate also includes certain royalty income and administrative costs related to the management of intellectual property.Other InformationGlobal Intellectual PropertyWe own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce and have licenses for the remainder. We also hold several patent and design registrations relating to beer dispensing systems, packaging, and certain other innovations. These patents have expiration dates through 2035. We are not reliant on patent royalties for our financial success. Therefore, these expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our business.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Such laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation, and for certain damages resulting from sites of past releases of hazardous materials. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows, or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. However, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not become more stringent in the future or that we will not incur material costs in the future in order to comply with such laws. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes under 10Table of Contentsthe caption "Environmental" for additional information regarding environmental matters.Employees and Employee RelationsCanadaWe have approximately 2,880 full-time employees in our Canada segment, of which 61% are represented by trade unions. We maintain agreements with the various unions representing workers at each of our facilities. We believe that relations with our Canada employees are good.United StatesWe have approximately 185 employees in our corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. We believe that relations with our U.S. employees are good.MillerCoors has approximately 9,000 employees. Approximately 36% of its work force is represented by unions. We believe that MillerCoors' relations with its U.S. employees are good.United KingdomWe have approximately 2,440 employees in our U.K. segment. Approximately 25% of this total workforce is represented by trade unions, primarily at our Burton-on-Trent and Tadcaster breweries. We believe that relations with our U.K. employees are good.Molson Coors InternationalWe have approximately 758 employees in our MCI business in 15 countries, primarily in Asia (China, India and Japan) and within our Denver headquarters office. We believe that relations with these employees are good.Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export SalesSee Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 "Segment Reporting" of the Notes for discussion of sales, operating income, and identifiable assets attributable to our country of domicile, the United States, and all foreign countries.Available InformationOur internet website is http://www.molsoncoors.com.

Risk FactorsThe reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Specific to Our CompanyCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than us, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies by these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, each of our major markets is mature.Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets; the failure or weakening of one or more of these products or markets could materially adversely affect our financial results.    Our Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands in Canada, Miller Lite and Coors Light brands in the U.S., and Carling brand in the U.K. represented more than half of each respective segment's sales in 2011. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business.If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the "Pentland Trust") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the "Coors Trust"), which together control more than ninety percent of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity and results of operations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global 12Table of Contentsequity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position, or results of operations.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum, glass and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of the packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint ventures, licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of one or more reporting segments.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized on a global basis, seeking to impose regulations to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in national regulations where we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British Pound ("GBP") and the Canadian dollar ("CAD").    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and in the U.K. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches, water, and packaging materials, including aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, and product quality.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may have a material effect on our business and financial results.Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages, or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 61%, 36% and 25% of our Canadian, MillerCoors, and U.K. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. Any labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.13Table of ContentsChanges to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products now sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system is increasingly subject to the legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse impact on MillerCoors and, consequently, MCBC. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business.Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could adversely impact our business.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on one information services provider worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, and other information technology functions to a third-party service provider. If one of these service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives.    In connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Potential resulting charges could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term, material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There are also water availability risks. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. We anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential issues associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or  joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital 14Table of Contentsinvestments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture.We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience continued price discounting in Canada.    The continuation, or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, could adversely impact our business.In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents the significant majority of the more than 50% bottle volume sales in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller, and hold a 42% economic interest. MillerCoors management is responsible for the day to day operations of the business and therefore, we do not have full control over the activities of MillerCoors. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller, and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.We may incur unexpected costs or face other business issues from MillerCoors due to challenges associated with integrating operations, technologies, and other aspects of the operations.    The MillerCoors management team continues to focus on fully integrating ours and SABMiller's U.S. operations, technologies, and services, as well as the distribution networks including the resolution of disputes arising from the consolidation of distributors arising from the MillerCoors joint venture. The failure of MillerCoors to successfully integrate the two operations could adversely affect our financial results or prospects.MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the United Kingdom SegmentSales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007 accelerated this trend. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely impact our profitability.Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impact pricing.    The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend could impact our ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to the spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Further consolidation could contribute to an 15Table of Contentsadverse financial impact.In the event that a significant pub chain were to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K. has caused business at on-premise outlets to slow since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that a pub chain were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. We depend exclusively on one logistics provider for the distribution of our products in the United Kingdom.    Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for us in the U.K., except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets. Due to product price, local competition and cultural differences, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Our operations in emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We expect our operations in emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain emerging markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in emerging markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations, and U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in some international jurisdictions. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries. Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. ("Kaiser") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. ("FEMSA"). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future.ITEM 1B
