STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In January 2009, Tronox Incorporated (Tronox), a former subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee), which is a current subsidiary of Anadarko, and certain of Tronox’s subsidiaries filed
voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Subsequently, in May 2009, Tronox and certain of its affiliates filed a lawsuit against
Anadarko and Kerr-McGee asserting a number of claims, including claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance. Tronox alleges, among other things, that it was insolvent or undercapitalized at the time it was spun off from Kerr-McGee and
seeks, among other things, to recover damages, including interest, in excess of $18.9 billion from Kerr-McGee and Anadarko, as well as litigation fees and costs. An adverse resolution of any proceedings related to Tronox could subject us to
significant monetary damages and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

 We may be subject to claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater
Horizon events that are not covered by BP’s indemnification obligations under our Settlement Agreement with BP, or that result in losses to the Company, notwithstanding BP’s indemnification against such losses, as a result of BP’s
inability to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement and BPCNA’s and BP p.l.c.’s inability to satisfy their guarantees of BP’s indemnification obligations. 
In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify
relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any
kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under OPA, NRD claims and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BPCNA and, in the event that the net worth of
BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor.  Any failure or
inability on the part of BP to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or on the part of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. to satisfy their respective guarantee obligations, could subject us to significant monetary liability beyond
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In November 2012, BP settled all criminal and securities claims brought by
the United States against BP, with BP agreeing to pay $4.0 billion over five years to the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the criminal claims and further agreeing to pay another $525 million over three years to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) with respect to the securities claims. BP represents that it is prepared to vigorously defend itself against remaining civil claims. Furthermore, in certain instances we may be required to recognize a liability for amounts for which
we are indemnified in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. Any such liability recognition without collection of the offsetting receivable could adversely impact our results of
operations, our financial condition, and our ability to make borrowings.  Under the Settlement Agreement, BP
does not indemnify the Company against fines and penalties, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims. The adverse resolution of any current or future proceeding related to the Deepwater Horizon
events for which we are not indemnified by BP could subject us to significant monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

 Oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices are volatile. A substantial or extended
decline in the price of these commodities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The
markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. For example, market prices for natural gas in the United States have declined substantially from 2008 price levels, and the rapid
development of shale plays throughout North America has contributed significantly to this trend. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
  


 
•
 
 domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs 
 


 
•
 
 volatile trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets 
 


 
•
 
 cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs 
 


 
•
 
 level of global crude-oil and natural-gas inventories 
 


 
•

 The long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil,
natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:   


 
•
 
 adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations
  


 
•
 
 reducing the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically 
 


 
•
 
 causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects 
 


 
•
 
 reducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows 
 


 
•
 
 reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil and natural-gas reserves 
 


 
•
 
 reducing the carrying value of our oil and natural-gas properties 
 


 
•
 
 reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and natural-gas reserves 
 


 
•
 
 limiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt 
Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations. 
Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject
to complex federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or
gathering-rate controls, hydraulic fracturing, and environmental protection regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from
various federal, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing
laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, from time to time, legislation has been proposed that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following:   


 
•
 
 Climate Change.    A number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing
emissions of green-house gases (GHGs). In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment and, based on these findings, has adopted regulations
that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. We may be required to install “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we
may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs.   


 
•
 
 Deficit Reduction or Tax Reform.    Congress may undertake significant deficit reduction or comprehensive tax reform in
the coming year. Proposals include provisions that would, if enacted, (i) eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) eliminate the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas qualified production
activities, and (iii) eliminate the acceleration of depreciation for tangible property.

 Federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory
initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production. 
Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from
dense subsurface rock formations such as shales that generally exist between 4,000 and 14,000 feet below ground. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion
programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation. The water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations, which are held open by the grains of sand, enabling the
oil or natural gas to flow to the wellbore. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities involving diesel under
the Safe Drinking Water Act and published draft permitting guidance in May 2012 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels with the public comment period expiring in August 2012. In November 2011, the EPA announced
its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the agency currently projects to issue an Advance Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking in May 2013 that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations. In May 2012, the Department of the Interior (DOI) released draft regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and
Indian oil and gas leases to require disclosure of information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, advance approval for well-stimulation activities, mechanical integrity testing of casing, and monitoring of well-stimulation
operations. In addition, Congress, from time to time, has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In the
event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we currently or in the future plan to operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that
may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. 
Certain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, Ohio, and Wyoming, have adopted,
and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, and additional well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations. For example, Texas adopted a law in
June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city
ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic-fracturing
activities. Nonetheless, in the event state or local restrictions are adopted in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements. These costs
may be significant in nature, and we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately
able to produce from our reserves.

 There are also certain governmental reviews recently conducted or underway
that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic-fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic-fracturing practices, and the EPA has commenced a study of the
potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a first progress report outlining work currently underway by the agency released on December 21, 2012, and a final draft report drawing conclusions
about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources expected to be available for public comment and peer review by 2014. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater
resulting from hydraulic-fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards for shale gas by 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the
environment from drilling using hydraulic-fracturing completion methods and, in August 2011, issued a report on immediate and longer-term actions that may be taken to reduce environmental and safety risks of shale-gas development. Also, as
discussed above, the DOI is pursuing regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian oil and gas leases. These studies, depending on any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
 The additional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, delays in
the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans, and other related developments arising after the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, or results of operations.  In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf
of Mexico in April 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), each agencies of the DOI, issued directives in May and July 2010 requiring lessees and operators of federal oil and
gas leases in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) regions of the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean to cease drilling all new deepwater wells, including wellbore sidetracks and bypasses, but excluding workovers, completions, plugging and abandonment, or
production, through November 30, 2010. In addition, the agencies issued a series of rules and Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs) imposing new and more stringent regulatory safety and performance requirements and permitting procedures
for new wells to be drilled in federal waters of the OCS. The federal government may issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding operations in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Compliance with these new and more stringent rules and regulations, uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions
and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, and oil spill-response plans, as a result of the new laws and regulations, and possible additional regulatory initiatives
could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts in the Gulf of Mexico. Among other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time
required to develop new technology, result in increased costs and limit activities in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or all of our facilities. We cannot predict with any
certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Other governments may also adopt safety, environmental or other laws and regulations that would adversely impact our
offshore developments in other areas of the world, including offshore Brazil, New Zealand, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Additional U.S. or foreign government laws or regulations would likely increase the costs associated with the offshore operations
of our drilling contractors. As a result, our drilling contractors may seek to pass increased operating costs to us through higher day-rate charges or through cost escalation provisions in existing contracts.

 In addition to increased governmental regulation, insurance costs may
increase across the energy industry and certain insurance coverage may be subject to reduced availability or not available on economically reasonable terms, if at all. In particular, the events in the Gulf of Mexico relating to the Deepwater Horizon
incident may make it increasingly difficult to obtain offshore property damage, well control, and similar insurance coverage. The potential increased costs and risks associated with offshore development may also result in certain current
participants allocating resources away from offshore development and discourage potential new participants from undertaking offshore development activities. Accordingly, we may encounter increased difficulty identifying suitable partners willing to
participate in our offshore drilling projects and prospects.  Further, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as
international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite the Company’s oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or
effectively execute any contingency plans related to future events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident. 
The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  The enactment of derivatives
legislation could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, establishes federal
oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and
regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic
equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions are exempt from these position limits. The position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia in September 2012 and the CFTC recently
stated that it will appeal the District Court’s decision. The CFTC also finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definition of “swap,” “swap dealer,” and “major swap participant.” Some
regulations, however, remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished. Depending on the Company’s classification and the particular nature of its derivative activities, the Dodd-Frank Act and
regulations may require the Company to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with its derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations may also require the counterparties to
the Company’s derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost
of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the
Company encounters, reduce the Company’s ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts, and increase the Company’s exposure to less-creditworthy counterparties. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a
result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, the Company’s results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to plan for and fund capital
expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural-gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural
gas. The Company’s revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and
operating flexibility.  Our total debt was $13.3 billion at December 31, 2012. We also have
various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including, but not limited
to, the following:   


 
•
 
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
 


 
•
 
 limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to
otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt
  


 
•
 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate 
 


 
•
 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments
 Additionally, the credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility
($5.0 billion Facility) contains a number of covenants that impose operating and financial constraints on the Company, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, and incur liens. Provisions of the
$5.0 billion Facility also require us to maintain specified financial covenants as further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by
events beyond our control.  A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and
ability to access capital.  At December 31, 2012, our debt was rated “BBB-” with a
positive outlook by Standard and Poor’s (S&P), “BBB-” with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and “Baa3” with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). Although we are not aware of any
current plans of S&P, Fitch, or Moody’s to lower their respective ratings on our debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital or our
ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. In
addition, a downgrade could affect the Company’s requirements to provide financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements and derivative agreements. See Note 12—Derivative Instruments in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

 Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our
reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our
control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this report represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The
procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates
of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and
assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:   


 
•
 
 historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas 
 


 
•
 
 assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings 
 


 
•
 
 assumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures 
 


 
•
 
 estimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs 
Estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different
engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows
included in this report should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average 12-month
sales prices using the average beginning-of-month price. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. 
Failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. 
Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are
economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find,
develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase. 
Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless
production is established on units containing the acreage.  A portion of our leasehold acreage is
currently undeveloped. Unless production in sufficient quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties.
Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based on various factors: drilling results, oil and natural-gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment,
gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.

 Poor general economic, business, or industry conditions may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.  During the last
few years, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, and a declining real estate market in the United States have
contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If economic recovery
in the United States or abroad is prolonged, demand for petroleum products could diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs; affect our vendors’, suppliers’ and customers’
ability to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.5 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012. Goodwill must be tested at least annually for
impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could lead to an impairment of goodwill, such as
the Company’s inability to replace the value of its depleting asset base, or other adverse events, such as lower sustained oil and natural-gas prices, which could reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. An impairment of goodwill
could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability.  We are subject to complex laws and
regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.  <FONT

protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:   


 
•
 
 issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities 
 


 
•
 
 protection of endangered species   


 
•
 
 amounts and types of emissions and discharges   


 
•
 
 generation, management, and disposition of waste materials 
 


 
•
 
 offshore oil and gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities 
 


 
•
 
 reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites 
 


 
•
 
 remediation of contaminated sites  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations. Future environmental laws and regulations, such
as the restriction against emission of pollutants from previously unregulated activities or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate, may negatively impact our industry. The cost of
satisfying these requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on our ability
to develop and produce our reserves. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 17—Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this
Form 10-K.

 We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that
could negatively impact our operations and financial results.  We conduct offshore operations in the Gulf
of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, Brazil, China, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire, New Zealand, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas because
we are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:   


 
•
 
 hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions   


 
•
 
 oilfield service costs and availability   


 
•
 
 compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations 
 


 
•
 
 terrorist attacks, such as piracy   


 
•
 
 remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials 
 


 
•
 
 failure of equipment or facilities  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in its shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can
market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.  Further, production of
reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly than from reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world. This results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of
Mexico during the initial few years of production and, as a result, our reserves replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere. Also, our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on
prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods.  We operate in foreign countries and
are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.  Our operations outside the United States are
based primarily in Algeria, Brazil, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, New Zealand, and Sierra Leone. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international
operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:   


 
•
 
 loss of revenue, property, and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest,
and other political risks   


 
•
 
 transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption
compliance laws and issues   


 
•
 
 increases in taxes and governmental royalties   


 
•
 
 unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities 
 


 
•
 
 redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes 
 


 
•
 
 difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over
international operations

•
 
 changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies 
 


 
•
 
 foreign-exchange restrictions   


 
•
 
 international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which
we conduct business  For example, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are currently engaged
in a dispute regarding the international maritime and land boundaries between the two countries. As a result, Côte d’Ivoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where we are
currently conducting exploration and appraisal activities. In the event Côte d’Ivoire is successful in its maritime border claims, our operations in the block could be materially impacted. 
Outbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in several countries in Africa and the Middle
East, including countries where we conduct operations, such as Algeria and Tunisia. As exhibited by the events in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, outbreaks of civil and political unrest have resulted in established governing bodies being
overthrown. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or
political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired. 
Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign
trade and taxation.  Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Our commodity-price risk-management and trading
activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.  To
the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments
used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur: 
 


 
•
 
 our production is less than the hedged volumes   


 
•
 
 there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement
  


 
•
 
 the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements 
 


 
•
 
 a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural-gas prices

 Deterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.
 We have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with
counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty.
Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have
exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such
lender’s commitment under our credit facility. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of the Company’s production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default
in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and gas, including blowouts, cratering
and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these
operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and worker’s compensation and employer’s
liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for
which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Material differences
between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following: 
 


 
•
 
 project approvals by joint-venture partners   


 
•
 
 timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies 
 


 
•
 
 weather conditions   


 
•
 
 availability of personnel   


 
•
 
 civil and political environment of the country or region in which the project is located 
 


 
•
 
 manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment 
 


 
•
 
 commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements
related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 The oil and gas exploration and production industry is very
competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies,
major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have
greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
 The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield
services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment,
supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our
budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our drilling activities may not be productive.  Drilling
for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations
may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:   


 
•
 
 unexpected drilling conditions   


 
•
 
 pressure or irregularities in formations   


 
•
 
 equipment failures or accidents   


 
•
 
 fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering 
 


 
•
 
 marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes 
 


 
•
 
 difficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel 
 


 
•
 
 title problems   


 
•
 
 other adverse weather conditions   


 
•
 
 shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
Certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse
effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.

 We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not
operate.  Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited
ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest
owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future
costs.  Our ability to sell our gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain
adequate services such as transportation.  The marketability of our production depends in part on the
availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the natural gas and
oil, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the gas and oil.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. 
Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko
difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders’ ability to bring
matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common
stock.  We may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock. 
We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. The amount of cash
dividends, if any, to be paid in the future will depend on actions taken by our Board of Directors, as well as, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects,
expected liquidity needs, and other related matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.  The loss
of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success. 
The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend,
in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities
integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or
attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
