ITEM 1A. Risk Factors




The risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or the trading price of our common stock.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.




The healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.




We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  Industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition.  In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues.




Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.




We obtain substantially all of our products from third-party suppliers.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  Because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control.  In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  An extended interruption in the supply of our products, including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product, would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.




Our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.




Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be adversely affected.




Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.




Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, among others.  The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman.  We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees.  Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.




Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:








•

  

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;











•

  

timing of pricing changes offered by our vendors;











•

  

timing of the introduction of new products and services by our vendors;











•

  

timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;











•

  

changes in or availability of vendor contracts or rebate programs;











•

  

vendor rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;











•

  

changes in the way vendors introduce or deliver products to market;











•

  

costs of developing new applications and services;











•

  

exclusivity requirements with certain vendors may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other vendors;











•

  

loss of sales representatives;











•

  

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;











•

  

costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance program;











•

  

general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;











•

  

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;











•

  

unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;











•

  

product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;











•

  

exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;











•

  

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers;











•

  

restructuring costs; and











•

  

changes in accounting principles.







Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.

Expansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.




The medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers and obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts and seeking to develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.




Increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.




Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.




Uncertain global macro-economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.




Uncertain global macro-economic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, including, among other things, sovereign debt levels, the inability of national or international political institutions to effectively resolve economic or budgetary crises or issues, consumer confidence, unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population), interest rates, availability of capital, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, healthcare costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest, could adversely impact our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect us.  Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales.  We generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.




Approximately 28% of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were derived from Europe.  There have been continuing concerns and uncertainties about the state of the European economies and Europe’s political institutions.  Continued difficult, and/or declining, economic conditions in Europe may adversely affect our operations in Europe by adversely affecting our European customers and vendors in the ways described above.  Additionally, the inability of Europe’s political institutions to deal effectively with actual or perceived currency or budget crises could increase economic uncertainty in Europe, and globally, and may have an adverse effect on our customer’s cash flow or operating performance.  Further, debt and/or budget crises in the European countries may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall healthcare spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall. In either event, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.




Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.




The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.




The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:








•


the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;











•


changes in our industry and competitors;











•


our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;











•


stock repurchases;











•


any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;











•


general market and economic conditions; and











•


any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.







In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NASDAQ.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would have an adverse effect on our business.




The healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business.




The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including: trends toward managed care; consolidation of healthcare distribution companies; consolidation of healthcare manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based healthcare practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers.  Both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.  If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry, our operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, the enactment of significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.




The implementation of the Health Care Reform Law may adversely impact us.




The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expands health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers.  We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could affect us adversely.  Additionally, further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

The Health Care Reform Law also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners, including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals, and imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  Data collection obligations were to commence in January 2012, and reporting requirements are to be implemented in 2013.  On December 14, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments, thus apparently delaying the January 1, 2012 start of information collection.  These proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change, and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized, they will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as an entity subject to these reporting requirements.  In addition, through business arrangements we have with drug and device manufacturers, we may be required to collect and report detailed information to these manufacturers in order for these manufacturers to comply with the new requirements.  In addition, several states require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states, or prohibit certain marketing related activities.  Other states, such as California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Connecticut, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.  Wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states.  In others, it is possible that our activities or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions.  Compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations.




The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  The Health Care Reform Law also mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates, discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under Medicare Part D, and in 2014 with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges, which could affect pricing and competition.




Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business.




Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products.  Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act.  Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:








•


regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;











•


subject us to inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration;











•


regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;











•


require registration with the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and various state agencies;











•


require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;











•


require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the United States Drug Enforcement Agency;











•


require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and











•


impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P products or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.

Applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  Our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  The United States Food and Drug Administration and United States Drug Enforcement Administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.




The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could negatively affect our business.  There can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.  If it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government healthcare programs, and damage our reputation.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.  We believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations.




If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

 

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud.  These measures, which focus on our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years.  Significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators,” who file complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state False Claims Act statutes and can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  These healthcare fraud laws and regulations, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs.  While we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts.  They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations.  If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.




State, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released.  These measures may govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and may require the users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  These also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.  In addition, under the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal HIPAA privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers.  Additional rules under the HITECH Act are expected to be issued in early 2012, further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses.  Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.




Our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results.




International operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The risks that our international operations are subject to include, among other things:








•


difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;











•


difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;











•


fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;











•


longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;











•


repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;











•


regulatory requirements;











•


unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;











•


imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties;











•


difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;











•


limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;











•


unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;











•


civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and











•


public health emergencies.

Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.




We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock.  Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:








•


may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;











•


requires significant management attention;











•


may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and











•


results in additional acquisition and integration expenses.







There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:








•


the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;











•


our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;











•


the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions; and











•


the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets.







Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.




We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management, financial and operational controls.  If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected.




We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.




Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, bone regeneration and other healthcare products.  Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  One of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.  A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.

Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.




Competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:








•


the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;











•


our ability to enhance our products and services; and











•


our ability to provide ongoing technical support.







We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software.  We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.




We may not be able to respond to technological change effectively.

 

        Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continued advancement of online commerce will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.  Our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business.




Risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations.




We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:








•


maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;











•


receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;











•


manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;











•


process payments to suppliers; and











•


maintain certain of our customers’ electronic medical records.




 


A cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in adverse business impact.  Risks may include, among other things:








•


future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;











•


operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IS systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities; and











•


negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.







Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our IS systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, cyber-attacks or fail for any extended period of time.

We have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.




Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

 

        The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  These provisions, among other things:








•


require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and











•


require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.




 


In addition, our 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by the Company or if they terminate for good reason in each case, within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.


 

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities.




We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives.  In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
