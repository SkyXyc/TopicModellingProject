Item 1A.Risk Factors.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters could significantly and adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company faces significant competition in the retail industry.The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of the nation’s largest retailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including conventional and specialty department stores, other specialty stores, category killers, mass merchants, value retailers, discounters, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Competition may intensify as the Company’s competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. If the Company does not compete effectively with regard to these factors, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The Company’s sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Company’s sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and customer behaviors 4Table of Contentstowards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather or natural disasters.The Company’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other developments and risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Company’s business. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, oil prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions or civil unrest, including terrorist activities and worldwide military and domestic disturbances and conflicts, may disrupt commerce and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.The Company’s business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of revenues fall in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.The Company’s business could be affected by extreme weather conditions or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company’s stores are located could adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company’s customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company’s sales and profitability. The Company’s business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company’s inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect the Company’s business.In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could severely damage or destroy one or more of the Company’s stores or warehouses located in the affected areas, thereby disrupting the Company’s business operations.The Company’s pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets could affect the funded status of the Company’s plans and could increase future funding requirements of the pension plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.The Company’s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. The Company is not able at this time to determine the impact that healthcare reform could have on the Company-sponsored medical plans.Inability to access capital markets could adversely affect the Company’s business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company’s access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company’s cost of borrowing. In addition, the Company’s bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company’s ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Company’s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Company’s debt would be in default and could become 5Table of Contentsdue and payable immediately. The Company’s assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill for possible impairment; if future circumstances indicate that goodwill is impaired, the Company could be required to write down amounts of goodwill and record impairment charges.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reduced the carrying value of its goodwill from $9,125 million to $3,743 million and recorded a related non-cash impairment charge of $5,382 million. The Company continues to monitor relevant circumstances, including consumer spending levels, general economic conditions and the market prices for the Company’s common stock, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of the Company’s goodwill. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made by the Company in assessing the appropriate valuation of its goodwill, could in the future require the Company to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges. If the Company were required to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, the Company’s financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees.The Company’s business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company’s ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services.The Company’s relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to the Company’s past success. The Company’s ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. The Company’s procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade. In addition, the Company’s procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Company’s ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company’s control and could adversely impact the Company’s performance.The Company's sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and operating results.The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.The Company’s advertising and promotional costs, net of cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to $1,136 million for 2011. The Company’s business depends on high customer traffic in its stores and effective marketing. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Company’s continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, 6Table of Contentssuppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company’s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company’s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Company’s computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company’s employees. If the Company’s computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations.A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Company’s customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the Company’s business.A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity, the Company’s business could be severely affected. Customers might avoid public places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the Company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores.The Company is subject to numerous regulations that could adversely affect its business.The Company is subject to customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without the Company’s knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or distributors, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both its core business operations and its credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase the Company's compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of its credit card and other operations.  In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the 7Table of Contentsordinary course of its business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Factors beyond the Company’s control could affect the Company’s stock price.The Company’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:•general economic and stock and credit market conditions;•risks relating to the Company’s business and its industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;•variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of the Company’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Company’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock.Item 1B
