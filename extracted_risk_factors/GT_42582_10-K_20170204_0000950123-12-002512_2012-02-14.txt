Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not achieve projected savings from our cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.       Our business continues to be impacted by trends that have negatively affected the tire industry in general, as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  These negative trends include volatile raw material costs, rising energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, and continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations.  In addition, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Unlike most other tire manufacturers, we also face the continuing burden of significant legacy pension costs.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we continue to implement various cost reduction initiatives and expect to achieve $1.0 billion in aggregate gross cost savings from 2010 through 2012 through our cost savings plan, which includes expected savings from continuous improvement initiatives, including savings under our USW agreement, increased low-cost country sourcing, high-cost capacity reductions, initiatives to reduce raw material costs and reduced selling, administrative and general expenses.  As of December 31, 2011, we have realized approximately $750 million of cost savings under this three-year plan.We have announced other important strategic initiatives, such as increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, such as our plan to close one of our facilities in Amiens, France, and increasing sales in emerging markets. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in new, expanded and modernized manufacturing facilities around the world. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to continue to improve the proportion, or mix, of higher margin tires we sell. In order to continue this improvement, we must be successful in marketing and selling products that offer higher margins such as the Assurance, Fuel Max, Eagle and Fortera lines of tires and in developing additional higher margin tires that achieve broad market acceptance. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business.We cannot assure you that our cost reduction and other initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs increased significantly over the past few years, and may continue to do so, driven by increases in prices of natural rubber and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate.Our pension plans are significantly underfunded and, in the future, the underfunding levels of our pension plans and our pension expense could materially increase.Although we have frozen a number of our pension plans globally, including our U.S. salaried pension plans, and closed participation in our primary U.S. hourly pension plan, many of our employees participate in, and many of our former employees are entitled to benefits under, defined benefit pension plans. Over time, we have experienced periods of declines in interest rates and pension asset values. As a result, our pension plans are significantly underfunded. Further declines in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plans, or certain other changes, could materially increase the underfunded status of our plans in 2012 and beyond and affect the level and timing of required contributions in 2013 and beyond. The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was $2,452 million and $645 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans of approximately $425 million to $450 million in 2012, and $425 million to $475 million in 2013. The current underfunded status of our pension 11Table of Contentsplans will, and a further material increase in the underfunded status of the plans would, significantly increase our required contributions and pension expense, which could impair our ability to achieve or sustain future profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in low-cost countries. In Brazil in 2011, we faced competition from increased imports of tires from Asia, which contributed to the year over year decline in Latin American Tire's segment operating income.  We may face further competitive pressures in Brazil and other key countries that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.Our long term ability to meet our obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our cost reduction plans and improving the results of our North American Tire segment. Concerns regarding the effect of the European sovereign debt crisis on financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the European and global capital markets and on our ability to access those markets to finance our European business or our business globally. Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The economic recovery in developed markets has been negatively impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  In emerging markets, high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions.  As a result of these economic conditions, our tire unit shipments in 2011 were essentially flat compared to 2010, and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for less than 20% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.12Table of ContentsAutomotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. For example, we are making a significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China, which began tire production in 2011.  We are also currently undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at our manufacturing facilities in Santiago, Chile; Americana, Brazil; Lawton, Oklahoma; Riesa, Germany; Fayetteville, North Carolina; and throughout EMEA in connection with new European tire labeling requirements. We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position. In addition, plant modernizations may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Approximately 11,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2012, primarily in Luxembourg, France and Poland. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.13Table of ContentsWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2011, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.2 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our cost reduction initiatives and other strategies, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, including required pension contributions, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings 14Table of Contentsoutstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•expropriations of property;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods.         For example, the European sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected economic conditions in Europe and globally. Our EMEA segment contributed 35% of our net sales and 46% of our total segment operating income in 2011.  If the European sovereign debt crisis continues or deepens, economic conditions in Europe may further deteriorate. In that case, our business in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected.As a further example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that fix the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela, and may continue to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner, they may cease supplying us. Venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials. If these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials, we may need to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including actions by the Venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations, economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending, and the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy. Goodyear Venezuela contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our Latin American Tire segment. As a result, any disruption of Goodyear Venezuela’s operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from Venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our Latin American Tire segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.         In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining 15Table of Contentseffective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2011, foreign currency translation favorably affected sales by $599 million and favorably affected segment operating income by $57 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.        We have material euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities.  If the European sovereign debt crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro, the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements.  Similarly, the re-introduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. In either case, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2.2 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with asbestos claims.We are among many defendants named in legal proceedings involving claims of individuals relating to alleged exposure to asbestos. At December 31, 2011, approximately 78,500 claims were pending against us alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to have resulted from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past or to asbestos in certain of our facilities. We expect that additional claims will be brought against us in the future. Our ultimate liability with respect to such pending and unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:•the number of claims that are brought in the future;•the costs of defending and settling these claims;•the risk of insolvencies among our insurance carriers;•the possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims;•the risk of changes in the litigation environment or Federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; and•the risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs.16Table of ContentsBecause of the uncertainties related to such claims, it is possible that we may incur a material amount of cost in excess of our current reserve for such claims. In addition, if any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, the resulting costs could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations in future periods. For further information regarding our asbestos liabilities, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.We may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to various legal proceedings. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. In that case, we may be required to issue a letter of credit to the surety posting the bond. We may issue up to an aggregate of $800 million in letters of credit under our $1.5 billion U.S. senior secured first lien credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had $407 million in letters of credit issued and $1,093 million of remaining availability under this facility. If we are subject to a significant adverse judgment and do not have sufficient availability under our credit facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond, we may be required to pay down borrowings under the facilities or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal. If we are unable to post cash collateral, we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment.Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a case-by-case basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, we would need to post other forms of collateral, such as letters of credit or cash. As described above, we may be unable to secure sufficient letters of credit under our credit facilities.If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to conform with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial position.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two important regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and will become effective between 2012 and 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all car and light and commercial truck tires produced after June 30, 2012 and requires that tires be labeled to inform consumers about the tire’s fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, since January 1, 2010, REACH has prohibited the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain safety-related performance characteristics, such as grip.17Table of ContentsThese U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The terms and conditions of our global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. provide for exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRI’s interest in our European and North American joint ventures.Under the global alliance agreements between us and SRI, SRI has the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in GDTE and GDTNA if certain triggering events have occurred, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in control of Goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements. While we have not done any current valuation of these businesses, any payment required to be made to SRI pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment, that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations. The withdrawal of SRI from the global alliance could also have other adverse effects on our business, including the loss of technology and purchasing synergies. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRI’s exit rights, see “Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyear’s Business — Global Alliance.”We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers.  To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.18Table of ContentsWe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses.ITEM 1B
