El Abra




We own a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the state-owned copper enterprise Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile (CODELCO).




El Abra is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of Calama in Chile’s El Loa province, Region II. The site is accessible by paved highway and by rail.




The El Abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization. The predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite. There is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization

as chalcocite. The oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite. There are lesser amounts of copper-bearing clays and tenorite.




The El Abra operation consists of an open-pit copper mine and an SX/EW facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 115,000 metric ton-per-day crushed leach circuit and a similar-sized, ROM leaching operation. The available fleet consists of thirty-five 220-metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 26 to 41 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 223,000 metric tons of material per day.




We are completing construction activities associated with the development of a large sulfide deposit at El Abra to extend its mine life by over 10 years. Construction activities for the initial phase of the project are approximately 80 percent complete. Production from the sulfide ore, which is projected to ramp up to approximately 300 million pounds of copper per year, is expected to replace the current depleting oxide copper production. The aggregate capital investment for this project is expected to total $725 million through 2015, of which approximately $565 million is for the initial phase of the project that is expected to be completed in second-quarter 2011.




El Abra’s copper production totaled 320 million pounds in 2010, 358 million pounds in 2009 and 366 million pounds in 2008.




El Abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 4,180 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3,410 meters above sea level. El Abra controls a total of 110,268 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit, stockpiles, process plant, and water wellfield and pipeline. In addition, El Abra has acquired land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine, the water wellfield, power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the Salar de Ascotán.




El Abra currently receives electrical power under a contract with Electroandina. Water for our El Abra processing operations comes from pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán pursuant to regulatory approval. We believe El Abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations. For a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”




Candelaria and Ojos del Salado




Candelaria

We have an 80 percent ownership interest in Candelaria, with the remaining 20 percent interest owned by affiliates of Sumitomo Corporation.




Candelaria’s open-pit copper mine has been in operation since 1993 and the underground mine has been in operation since 2005. The Candelaria copper mining complex is located approximately 12 miles south of Copiapó in northern Chile’s Atacama province, Region III. The site is accessible by two maintained dirt roads, one coming through the Tierra Amarilla community and the other off of Route 5 of the International Pan-American Highway. Copper concentrates are transported by truck to the Punta Padrones port facility located in Caldera, approximately 50 miles northwest of the mine.

Table of Contents






The Candelaria mine is an iron oxide, copper and gold deposit. Primary sulfide mineralization consists of chalcopyrite.




The Candelaria operation consists of an open-pit copper mine and a 6,000 metric ton-per-day underground copper mine, which is mined by sublevel stoping, feeding a 75,000 metric ton-per-day concentrator.  The available fleet consists of forty-four 225-metric ton haul trucks loaded by six shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 13 to 43 cubic meters, which are capable of moving 235,000 metric tons of material per day.




Candelaria’s production totaled 300 million pounds of copper and 76 thousand ounces of gold in 2010, 296 million pounds of copper and 74 thousand ounces of gold in 2009, and 383 million pounds of copper and 98 thousand ounces of gold in 2008.




Candelaria is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 675 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 30 meters below sea level. The Candelaria property encompasses approximately 13,390 acres, including approximately 125 acres for the port facility in Caldera. The remaining property consists of mineral rights owned by us in which the surface is not owned but controlled by us, which is consistent with Chilean law.




Candelaria receives electrical power through long-term contracts with Empresa Eléctrica Guacolda S.A., a local energy company. Candelaria’s water supply comes from well fields in the area of Tierra Amarilla and Copiapó that draw water from the Copiapó River aquifer. Because of rapid depletion of that aquifer in recent years, Candelaria is expanding its sources of water supply. We have recently completed construction of a pipeline to bring water from a nearby water treatment facility, and have also started engineering for a desalination plant that will supply all of Candelaria’s longer term water needs. The plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 at an aggregate capital investment of approximately $280 million. For further discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, see Item 1A. &#
8220;Risk Factors.”




Ojos del Salado

We have an 80 percent ownership interest in Ojos del Salado, with the remaining 20 percent interest owned by affiliates of Sumitomo Corporation.




The Ojos del Salado operation began commercial production in 1929 and consists of two underground copper mines (Santos and Alcaparrosa) and a 3,800 metric ton-per-day concentrator. The operation is located approximately 10 miles east of Copiapó in northern Chile’s Atacama province, Region III, and is accessible by paved highway. The Ojos del Salado mines are iron oxide and copper and gold deposits. Primary sulfide mineralization consists of chalcopyrite.




The Ojos del Salado operation has a capacity of 3,800 metric tons per day of ore from the Santos underground mine and 4,000 metric tons of ore per day from the Alcaparrosa underground mine. The ore from both mines is mined by sublevel stoping since both the ore and enclosing rocks are competent. The broken ore is removed from the stopes using scoops and loaded into an available fleet of twenty-six 28-metric ton trucks, which transport the ore to the surface. The ore from the Santos mine is hauled directly to the Ojos del Salado mill for processing, and the ore from the Alcaparrosa mine is reloaded into six 54-metric ton trucks and hauled seven miles to the Candelaria mill for processing. The Ojos del Salado concentrator has the capacity to produce over 30 million pounds of copper and 9,000 ounces of gold per year. Tailings from the Ojos d
el Salado mill are pumped to the Candelaria tailings facility for final deposition. The Candelaria facility has sufficient capacity for the remaining Ojos del Salado tailings.




Ojos del Salado’s production totaled 66 million pounds of copper and 17 thousand ounces of gold in 2010, 74 million pounds of copper and 18 thousand ounces of gold in 2009, and 63 million pounds of copper and 16 thousand ounces of gold in 2008.




Ojos del Salado is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest underground level is at an elevation of 500 meters above sea level, with the lowest underground level at 150 meters above sea level. The Ojos del Salado mineral rights encompass approximately 15,815 acres, which includes approximately 6,784 acres of owned land in and around the Ojos del

Indonesia

 




Ownership. PT Freeport Indonesia is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and incorporated in Delaware. We directly own 81.28 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia, 9.36 percent indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama, and the Government of Indonesia owns the remaining 9.36 percent.




We have established certain unincorporated joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto). Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2021 in Block A of PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in all production from Block A (refer to Note 2 for further discussion).




Contract of Work (COW). Through a COW with the Government of Indonesia, PT Freeport Indonesia conducts its current exploration and mining operations in Indonesia. The COW governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters, and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which expresses Indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors. Specifically, the COW provides that the Government of Indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations. Any disputes r
egarding the provisions of the COW are subject to international arbitration. We have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in Indonesia.




PT Freeport Indonesia’s original COW was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by a new COW in 1991. The initial term of the current COW expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. The COW allows us to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in the 24,700-acre Block A area, which is where all of PT Freeport Indonesia’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located. Under the COW, PT Freeport Indonesia also conducts exploration activities in the approximate 500,000-acre Block B area.

As further discussed in Note 14, PT Freeport Indonesia pays copper royalties under its COW, and has agreed to pay additional royalties to the Government of Indonesia that are not required under its COW. The additional royalties provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the Indonesian province of Papua. PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of the combined royalties totaled $156 million in 2010, $147 million in 2009 and $113 million in 2008.




PT Irja Eastern Minerals (Eastern Minerals), of which we own 100 percent, conducts exploration through a joint venture agreement, under a separate COW in an area covering approximately 450,000 acres in Papua.




Under a joint venture agreement through PT Nabire Bakti Mining (PTNBM), we conduct exploration activities under a separate COW in an area covering approximately 500,000 acres in five parcels contiguous to PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks.




In 2008, Indonesia enacted a new mining law, which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the COW system that applies to PT Freeport Indonesia, Eastern Minerals and PTNBM. In 2010, the Government of Indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing COWs. The regulations provide that COWs will continue to be honored until their expiration. However, the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to existing COWs and to convert any existing COWs to licenses for any extension periods provided by the applicable COW even though our COWs provide for two 10-year extension periods under the existing terms of our COWs.




Grasberg Minerals District.  PT Freeport Indonesia operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of New Guinea. We and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in Block A since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations. The Grasberg minerals district currently has three mines in operation: the Grasberg open pit, the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground block cave and the Big Gossan open stoping mine. We also have significant development projects in the Grasberg minerals district, which are discussed in more detail in “Development Projects and Exploration” and in Item 7.  
220;Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”




PT Freeport Indonesia’s production, including our joint venture partner’s share, totaled 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 2.0 million ounces of gold in 2010, 1.6 billion pounds of copper and 3.0 million ounces of gold in 2009 and 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.2 million ounces of gold in 2008.




Our principal source of power for all our Indonesian operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion. Diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations. Our Indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches.




Grasberg Open Pit  

We began open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. Open-pit operations are expected to continue through mid 2016, at which time underground mining operations are scheduled to begin at our Grasberg Block Cave mine, which is currently in development. Production in the open-pit is currently at the 3,265- to 3,940- meter elevation level and totaled 53 million metric tons of ore in 2010 and 57 million metric tons of ore in 2009, which provided 63 percent of our 2010 mill feed and 70 percent of our 2009 mill feed. Remaining mill feed comes from our DOZ and Big Gossan mines.




The current equipment fleet consists of over 500 units. The larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 163 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons and 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters, which during 2010 moved an average of 701,000 metric tons per day.




Grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225,000 metric tons per day of Grasberg ore to the mill and 135,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles. The remaining ore and overburden is moved by haul trucks.

Deep Ore Zone (DOZ)

The DOZ ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone. We began production from the DOZ ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the Grasberg deposit. Production resumed in September 2000 using the block-cave method. Production is at the 3,110-meter elevation level and totaled 29 million metric tons of ore in 2010 and 26 million metric tons in 2009. Production at the DOZ mine is expected to continue through 2019. Beginning in 2015, we plan to ramp up production at our Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) block cave mine, which is currently under development.




During 2010, we completed over 10,000 meters of development drifting in support of the block-cave mining method for the DOZ mine. The expansion of the DOZ operation to 80,000 metric tons of ore per day is complete. The success of the development of the DOZ mine, one of the world’s largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future development of PT Freeport Indonesia’s large-scale undeveloped underground ore bodies.




The DOZ mine fleet consists of over 195 pieces of mobile heavy equipment, which in 2010 moved an average of 80,000 metric tons of ore per day. The primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 LHD units and 25 haul trucks. Our production LHD units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore. Using ore passes and chutes, the LHD units transfer ore into 55-ton capacity haul trucks. The trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles.




Big Gossan

The Big Gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site and is a skarn hosted copper, gold and silver deposit.  It is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters.  The mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill.  Stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level.  Trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher.  The crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt.  The belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and carried to the surface
 mill stockpile for processing.




Production began in fourth-quarter 2010 and is designed to ramp up to 7,000 metric tons per day by late 2012, which will result in average annual aggregate incremental production of 125 million pounds of copper and 65 thousand ounces of gold (with PT Freeport Indonesia receiving 60 percent of these amounts).




Description of Ore Bodies. Our Indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg open pit and block cave, and portions of the DOZ block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a much lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the DOZ and all of the Big Gossan) occur as “magnet
ite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.




The copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite.

We currently own an effective 57.75 percent interest in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district. The remaining ownership interests are held by Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin) (currently an effective 24.75 percent interest) and La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines), which is wholly owned by the Government of the DRC (currently 17.5 percent non-dilutable interest).




We are entitled to mine in the DRC under the Amended and Restated Mining Convention (ARMC) between TFM and the government of the DRC. The original Mining Convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the ARMC in 2005. As further discussed in Note 14, in October 2010, the government of the DRC announced the conclusion of the review of TFM’s contracts, and confirmed that the existing mining contracts are in good standing and acknowledged the rights and benefits granted under those contracts. In connection with the review, TFM made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). In December 2010, the addenda to TFM’s ARMC and Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement were signed by the parties and are pending a Presidential Decree. 
TFM’s existing mining contracts will be in effect until the Presidential Decree is obtained. After giving effect to the amendments and obtaining approval of the modification to TFM’s bylaws, our effective ownership interest in the project will be 56.0 percent.




TFM pays a royalty of 2 percent of net revenues under the ARMC, which totaled $20 million in 2010 and $7 million in 2009.




The Tenke Fungurume deposits are located in the Katanga province of the DRC approximately 110 miles northwest of Lubumbashi. The deposits are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail. The Tenke Fungurume deposits are sediment-hosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide and sulfide mineralization. The dominant oxide minerals are malachite, pseudomalachite and heterogenite. Important sulfide minerals consist of bornite, carrollite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite.




Initial copper production commenced at the Tenke Fungurume mine in late March 2009. Targeted copper production rates were achieved in September 2009 and the cobalt and sulphuric acid plants were commissioned in third-quarter 2009. Copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitation-leach plant. The milling facilities at Tenke, which were designed to produce at a capacity rate of 8,000 metric tons of ore per day, have been performing above capacity, with mill throughput averaging 10,300 metric tons of ore per day in 2010. The current equipment fleet includes one twelve-cubic meter front-end loader, ten 5-cubic meter front-end loaders, four 91-metric ton haul trucks, twenty-nine 45-metric ton haul trucks, surface miners, production drills, sampling machines and crawler dozers.




We are planning a second phase of the project, which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity. As part of the second phase, a range of near-term expansion options are being considered, which have the potential of adding 100 million to 200 million pounds of copper per year over the next two to three years. Future expansions are subject to a number of factors, including economic and market conditions and the business and investment climate in the DRC.

Table of Contents




Tenke’s production totaled 265 million pounds of copper and 20 million pounds of cobalt in 2010 and 154 million pounds of copper in 2009.




Tenke Fungurume is located in a tropical region; however, temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes. Weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season, each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year. The highest bench elevation is expected to be 1,490 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,270 meters above sea level. The Tenke Fungurume deposits are located within four concessions totaling 394,455 acres.




Tenke Fungurume has entered into long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with La Société Nationale d’Electricité, the state-owned electric utility company serving the region. The results of a recent water exploration program, as well as the regional geological and hydro-geological conditions, indicate that adequate water is available for the project, and for hydro-electric generation during the expected life of the operation.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION

 

We are increasing near-term production at several of our copper mines and also have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. Major development projects currently include the development of the massive underground ore bodies in the Grasberg minerals district, the El Abra sulfide reserves and the development of the Climax molybdenum mine. Studies are under way to evaluate a large-scale concentrator expansion at Cerro Verde, a major mill project at El Abra, various mill projects to process sulfide ore in North America and staged expansion options at Tenke. For further discussion of these and our other development projects and exploration activities, refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and R
esults of Operations.”




In addition to the development projects in progress in the Grasberg minerals district, we also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the Grasberg minerals district for the Kucing Liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the Grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. We expect to mine the Kucing Liar ore body using the block-cave method. Aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the Kucing Liar ore body are expected to approximate $2 billion.




Over the next five years, we estimate aggregate capital spending for underground mine development in the Grasberg minerals district to average approximately $600 million per year. These costs will be shared with Rio Tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement. Considering the long-term nature and large size of these projects, actual costs could differ materially from these estimates.




In addition to the mine development costs above, our current mine development plans include approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once Grasberg open-pit operations cease. Substantially all of these expenditures will be made between 2016 and 2030. We continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves.




SMELTING FACILITIES




Atlantic Copper, S.A. Our wholly owned Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the Huelva, Spain port authorities, which expire in 2027.




The design capacity of the smelter is 290,000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 265,000 metric tons of copper per year. During 2010, Atlantic Copper treated 980,700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 255,000 metric tons of copper anodes and 253,100 metric tons of copper cathodes. During 2009, Atlantic Copper treated 1,000,700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 269,000 metric tons of copper anodes and 256,600 metric tons of copper cathodes.




Atlantic Copper has a 21-day maintenance turnaround scheduled in April 2011.  Atlantic Copper’s last shutdown was in 2007, when it completed a scheduled 23-day maintenance turnaround. Major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 12 years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim.




During 2010, Atlantic Copper purchased 28 percent of its concentrate requirements from PT Freeport Indonesia and 25 percent from our South America mines at market prices.




We made no capital contributions to Atlantic Copper from 2005 through 2010. We loan funds to Atlantic Copper from time to time, and at December 31, 2010, these loans totaled $411 million. Our net investment in Atlantic Copper was approximately $22 million at December 31, 2010.




PT Smelting. PT Freeport Indonesia’s 1991 COW required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in Indonesia if we and the Indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of PT Smelting, an Indonesian company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia, Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (Mitsubishi Materials), Mitsubishi Corporation Unimetals Ltd. (Mitsubishi) and Nippon Mining & Metals Co., Ltd.  (Nippon) own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent, and 5 percent, respectively, of the outstanding PT Smelting common stock. PT Smelting owns and ope
rates the smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia.

Table of Contents



 

PT Freeport Indonesia’s contract with PT Smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis.  PT Freeport Indonesia also sells copper concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates, which are not subject to a minimum or maximum rate, for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually.  Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of our investment in PT Smelting.




During 2006, PT Smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity to 275,000 metric tons of copper per year. During 2010, PT Smelting treated 1,034,800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 262,700 metric tons of copper anodes and 277,500 metric tons of copper cathodes. During 2009, PT Smelting treated 1,073,900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 310,200 metric tons of copper anodes and 286,000 metric tons of copper cathodes.




In 2008, PT Smelting completed a scheduled 25-day maintenance turnaround. Major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for PT Smelting, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.




Miami Smelter. We own and operate a smelter at our Miami, Arizona mining operation. The smelter has been in production for over 80 years and has been upgraded during that period to implement new technologies, to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements. Additionally, there are new air regulations that may require the Miami smelter to implement new technologies to meet these requirements (refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion).




The Miami smelter processes concentrate primarily from our Arizona copper mines. Concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 625,000 metric tons in 2010 and 619,000 metric tons in 2009. In addition, because sulphuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrates, the Miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our North America leaching operations.




The Miami smelter has a 30-day maintenance shutdown scheduled in June 2011. Major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 14 months for the Miami smelter, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.




OTHER PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENTS




Rod & Refining Operations. Our Rod & Refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in North America including a refinery in El Paso, Texas; rod mills in El Paso, Texas, Norwich, Connecticut and Miami, Arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in Bayway, New Jersey. We refine our copper anode production from our Miami smelter, along with purchased anodes, at our El Paso refinery. The El Paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at Miami. Our El Paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride, and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium.




Molybdenum Conversion Facilities. We process molybdenum concentrates at our conversion plants in the U.S. and Europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates, molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum metal powder. We operate molybdenum roasters in Sierrita, Arizona; Fort Madison, Iowa; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

 

The conversion facility located at our Sierrita mine consists of two molybdenum roasters that process molybdenum concentrates produced at our mines and on a toll basis for third parties. The facility produces molybdenum oxide and related products.

 

The Fort Madison, facility consists of two molybdenum roasters, a sulphuric acid plant, a metallurgical (technical oxide) packaging facility, and a chemical conversion plant, which includes a wet-chemicals plant, sublimation equipment and molybdenum disulfide processing and packaging. In the chemical plant, molybdic oxide is further refined into various high-purity molybdenum chemicals for a wide range of uses by chemical and catalyst manufacturers. In addition to metallurgical oxide products, the Fort Madison facility produces ammonium dimolybdate, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium octamolybdate, sodium molybdate, sublimed pure molybdic oxide and molybdenum disulfide.

 

The Rotterdam conversion facility consists of a molybdenum roaster, sulphuric acid plant, metallurgical packaging

facility and chemical conversion plant. The plant produces metallurgical products primarily for third parties. Ammonium dimolybdate and pure molybdic oxide are produced in the wet-chemicals plant.

 

We also produce ferromolybdenum for worldwide customers at our conversion plant located in Stowmarket, United Kingdom. The plant is operated both as an internal and external customer tolling facility.




McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR). In December 2010, we completed the purchase of 500,000 shares of MMR’s 5¾% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million.  The Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 62.5 shares of MMR common stock per share of Preferred Stock (an aggregate of 31.25 million shares or approximately 14 percent of MMR’s common stock on a fully converted basis at December 31, 2010), or an initial conversion price of $16 per share of MMR common stock.  In connection with the completion of the purchase, we entered into a registration rights agreement and a stockholder agreement with MMR.




MMR is engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. MMR is currently undertaking a major capital program to fund recent success and additional exploration. Our investment will allow us to participate in MMR’s highly prospective North American exploration and development activities, which have the potential to general significant value.





Several of our directors and executive officers also serve as directors or executive officers of MMR.

In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary FM Services Company (FM Services) provides certain executive, technical administrative, accounting, financial, tax and other services to us and to MMR on a cost-reimbursement basis. Refer to Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence,” for additional information.





SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS




Our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally electricity, diesel, coal and natural gas. Most of our energy is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. For additional information, refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”




Sulphuric acid is used in the SX/EW process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burner at the Tenke mine. In addition, we are completing construction of a sulphur burner at our Safford mine, which will provide a more cost-effective source of sulphuric acid used in our North America SX/EW operations. Sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as required.




Our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights, the loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. For a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”




COMPETITION




The top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 50 percent of total worldwide mined copper production. We currently rank second among those producers at approximately 9 percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production. Our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs.<

ENVIRONMENTAL AND RECLAMATION MATTERS




The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business. For information about environmental regulation, litigation and related costs, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”, and Notes 1 and 13.




COMMUNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS




We have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. We continue to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs, which include:




· comprehensive job training programs

· basic education programs

· public health programs, including malaria control                                                                                                

· agricultural assistance programs

· small and medium enterprise development programs

· cultural preservation programs

·    water and sewage treatment projects

·    clean water access

· charitable donations







In December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security (Voluntary Principles). Several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the Voluntary Principles and have endorsed them. We participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy.

We believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. Nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.




South America. Cerro Verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years. During 2006, as a result of discussions with local mayors in the Arequipa region, Cerro Verde agreed to contribute to the design and construction of domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region. These facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion.




Also during 2006, the Peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in Peru would be required to make annual contributions to local development funds for a 5-year period (covering the years 2006 through 2010) when copper prices exceed certain levels that are adjusted annually. The contribution was equal to 3.75 percent of after-tax profits, of which 2.75 percent was contributed to a local mining fund and 1.00 percent to a regional mining fund. Cerro Verde’s contributions totaled $41 million in 2010 and $28 million in both 2009 and 2008. It is uncertain whether the contribution will be extended, abandoned or replaced by a tax or different mechanism.




Indonesia. In 1996, PT Freeport Indonesia established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (the Partnership Fund), through which PT Freeport Indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support the economic, health, education and social development of the area. PT Freeport Indonesia has committed through 2011 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the Partnership Fund. Our share of contributions to the Partnership Fund totaled $64 million in 2010, $59 million in 2009 and $34 million in 2008.




The Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Organization (Lembaga Pembangunan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro or LPMAK) oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the Partnership Fund. LPMAK is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors, which are comprised of representatives from the local Amungme and Kamoro tribal communities, government leaders, church leaders, and one representative of PT Freeport Indonesia on each board. The Amungme and Kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations.




Security Matters. Consistent with our COW in Indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property, we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. As part of its security program, PT Freeport Indonesia maintains its own internal security department, which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring the shipment of company supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. The security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy.




Between July 2009 and January 2010, there were a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at the Grasberg mining complex. In connection with these incidents, there were three fatalities (refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion). PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $28 million for 2010, $18 million for 2009 and $22 million for 2008.




PT Freeport Indonesia, and all businesses and residents of Indonesia, rely on the Government of Indonesia for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. The Grasberg minerals district has been designated by the Government of Indonesia as one of Indonesia’s vital national assets. This designation results in the police and to a lesser extent, the military, playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The Government of Indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations.




From the outset of PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, the government has looked to PT Freeport Indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the Indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in Papua. PT Freeport Indonesia’s financial support for the Indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better

ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol PT Freeport Indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area. In addition, the provision of such support is consistent with PT Freeport Indonesia’s obligations under the COW, reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights.




PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of support costs for the government-provided security was $14 million for 2010, $10 million for 2009 and $8 million for 2008. This supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police.




Africa. TFM has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the Katanga province of the DRC. Initiatives that have commenced over the past three years include a malaria control program, construction and operational support for six elementary schools, installation of over 40 clean water wells throughout the concession as well as five villages outside the concession, a public sanitation (latrines and hand washing) program reaching over 2,000 households, a mobile clinic for rural villages, and economic development programs supporting local entrepreneurs, farmers and women’s income generation, and literacy groups. We have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country, including upgra
ding a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems.




TFM has also committed to contribute 0.3 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services. This fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans, meet basic community needs and promote good governance. Community development fund contributions totaled approximately $3 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2009.




Security Matters. TFM also engages government security to assist with security matters at its concession area. Unarmed security personnel (including administration and guard forces) along with government security provide security for the mine site. TFM provides food, housing, monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area. The total cost to TFM for this support, including in-kind support, totaled less than $1 million for the years 2010 and 2009.




TFM also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel, other mining companies, and representatives from the United Nations to discuss security issues and concerns.

ORE RESERVES




Recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of December 31, 2010, in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserve
s for which (1) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (2) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (3) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.




Our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees; a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.




Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2010, were determined using long-term average prices of $2.00 per pound for copper, $750 per ounce for gold, $10.00 per pound for molybdenum, $15.00 per ounce for silver and $10.00 per pound for cobalt. For the three year period ended December 31, 2010, LME spot copper prices averaged $2.97 per pound, London gold prices averaged $1,023 per ounce, and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $18.76 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are the par
t of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

In defining our open-pit reserves, we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. We use a break-even cutoff grade to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. The break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production.




Our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum, silver and cobalt. We value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. Copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. Our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade.




The table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of December 31, 2010:

Drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals, such as geologists and geological engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification. Drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit.




The following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type:

Production Sequencing

The following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body. The chart also shows the term of PT Freeport Indonesia’s COW. Production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. The ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. In addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. Sign
ificant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below.






 

Mill and Leach Stockpiles

Mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery. For mill stockpiles, recovery is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. For leach stockpiles, recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities.




Because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles.




Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately.

Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production-scale process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including type of copper recovery, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years.




Processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. During fourth-quarter 2010, revised recovery rate estimates at El Abra resulted in a reduction of 163 million pounds in leach stockpiles.  Following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of December 31, 2010:

MINERALIZED MATERIAL




We hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant. However, permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors. Estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of $2.20 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for go
ld and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding anticipated production volumes, unit net cash costs, sales volumes, ore grades, milling rates, commodity prices, development and capital expenditures, mine production and development plans, availability of power, water, labor and equipment, environmental reclamation and closure costs and plans, environmental liabilities and expenditures, litigation expense and results, dividend payments, potential prepayments of debt, reserve estimates, exploration efforts and results, operating cash flows, the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum and cobalt price changes, deferred intercompany profit impacts o
n financial results, and anticipated political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected, anticipated or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following.




Financial risks




Extended declines in the market prices of copper, gold and/or molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and, if sustained, could adversely affect our ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities.




Our financial results are affected significantly by the market prices of copper and, to a lesser extent, gold and molybdenum (for further information about movements in the market prices of these commodities, refer to discussion below and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). An extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could (1) adversely affect our financial results, (2) adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations, and (3) depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.




Substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future period (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) monthly average spot prices. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods. However, in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.




There continues to be uncertainty in the global economy, which could negatively affect the market prices of commodities, including the metals that we produce. If market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses.




Copper prices have fluctuated historically, with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.26 to $4.42 per pound during the three years ended December 31, 2010. The LME spot copper price closed at $4.50 per pound on February 11, 2011. Copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:








·  


The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world;











·  


Available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories;











·  


Sales by holders and producers of copper;











·  


Demand for industrial products containing copper;











·  


Investment activity, including speculation, in copper as a commodity;











·  


The availability and cost of substitute materials; and

·  


Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar.







Gold prices have also fluctuated historically, with London gold prices ranging from $713 to $1,421 per ounce for the three years ended December 31, 2010. London gold prices closed at $1,364 per ounce on February 11, 2011. Gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:








·  


The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China;











·  


Global or regional political or economic crises;











·  


The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar and other currencies;











·  


Expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;











·  


Interest rates;











·  


Purchases and sales of gold by governments, central banks and other holders;











·  


Demand for jewelry containing gold; and











·  


Investment activity, including speculation, in gold as a commodity.







Molybdenum prices also fluctuate, with the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranging from $7.83 to $33.88 per pound for the three years ended December 31, 2010. The Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price was $17.58 per pound on February 11, 2011. Molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:








·  


The worldwide balance of molybdenum demand and supply;











·  


Rates of global economic growth, especially construction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel;











·  


The volume of molybdenum produced as a by-product of copper production;











·  


Inventory levels;











·  


Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar; and











·  


Production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors.




 

Under U.S. federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines, we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or equivalent state regulations. The failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

 

We generally are required by U.S. federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. These laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance.

 

EPA and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under CERCLA or equivalent state regulations. In July 2009, EPA published a Priority Notice of Action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements

concerning the degree and duration of risk associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous substances. It is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations.

 

As of December 31, 2010, our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs totaled approximately $793 million, of which approximately $482 million was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. Our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on our ability to meet financial tests. Certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a state-approved ratings service. We are currently rated investment grade by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P), Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). If we fail to maintain our investment grade rating, we would be subject t
o these more rigorous tests, in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. Depending on our financial condition and market conditions, these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide. Issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines. As of December 31, 2010, we had limited financial assurance obligations associated with CERCLA-related remediation obligations, although EPA and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements for such obligations. For additional information, see the environmental risk factor “Mine closure regulations impose substantial 
costs on our operations” below.

 

The agreements governing our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and other covenants and as a result may limit our flexibility in the operation of our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.




At December 31, 2010, the outstanding principal amount of our debt was $4.8 billion. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:








·  


Incur additional indebtedness;











·  


Engage in transactions with affiliates;











·  


Create liens on our assets;











·  


Make payments in respect of equity issued by us or our subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on our common stock;











·  


Make investments in, or loans, to entities that we do not control, including joint ventures;











·  


Sell assets;











·  


Merge with or into other companies;











·  


Enter into sale and leaseback transactions;











·  


Enter into unrelated businesses;











·  


Enter into agreements or arrangements that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions;











·  


Prepay indebtedness; and











·  


Enter into hedging transactions other than in the ordinary course of business.







Because the ratings on our senior notes are investment grade, the restrictions contained in our 8.375% and 8.25% Senior Notes on incurring debt, making restricted payments and selling assets are currently suspended. To the extent the rating is downgraded below investment grade by both S&P and Moody’s, the covenants would again become effective. Our revolving credit facilities contain restrictions on the amount available for dividend

payments, purchases of our common stock and certain debt prepayments. However, these restrictions do not apply as long as availability under the revolvers plus domestic cash exceeds $750 million. At December 31, 2010, we had availability under the revolvers plus available domestic cash (as defined by the revolving credit facilities) of approximately $4.1 billion. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion.




In addition, our revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests at any time that borrowings are outstanding under these facilities, including a leverage ratio test (Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the facility, for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 5.0 to 1.0 on the last day of any fiscal quarter) and a secured leverage ratio test (Total Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the facility, for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 3.0 to 1.0 on the last day of any fiscal quarter). During periods in which copper, gold or molybdenum prices or production volumes, or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors, we may not be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants.




Our obligations under our revolving credit facilities are (1) guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (2) secured by a pledge of (a) 100 percent of the equity in substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (b) 66.5 percent of the equity in substantially all of our first tier foreign subsidiaries.




Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our revolving credit facilities, senior notes or any agreement governing our other indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period, may result in an event of default. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. We would not be able to fully repay when due borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default.




If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default, the lenders under our revolving credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans, declare all borrowings outstanding (together with accrued interest and other fees) immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral. Any such actions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.




Movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results.




The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. dollar. All of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollar, Chilean peso, Peruvian nuevo sol and euro. Generally, our results are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies. Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs.




From time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations.




Operational risks




Our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business.




Mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks, some of which are outside of our control. These operational risks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include the following:








·  


Earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters;











·  


The occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events;











·  


The failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications, design or expectations;




 



  



43







Table of Contents



 





·  


Accidents;











·  


Wall failures and rock slides in our open pit mines, and structural collapses in our underground mines;











·  


Problems associated with the construction and management of large impoundments containing tailings or other viscous or semi-solid materials, some of which also contain mineral and chemical contaminants, such as structural failures or leakages;











·  


Interruption of energy supply;











·  


Lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates;











·  


Metallurgical and other processing problems;











·  


Unanticipated ground and water conditions;











·  


Adverse claims to water rights and shortages of water to which we have rights;











·  


Adjacent land ownership or usage that results in constraints on current or future mine operations;











·  


Delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits;











·  


Delays in transportation and disruptions of supply routes;











·  


Labor disputes; and











·  


The inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage.







The failure to adequately manage some of these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment, both on and outside our operating sites, as well as damage to production facilities and delays in production.




Our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies.




Our operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines depends on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims. At our North America operations, under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which, for over 30 years, the State of Arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state’s largest river systems that affect four of our operating mines (Morenci, Sierrita, Mia
mi and Safford). The legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our Arizona mine at Bagdad. Groundwater is not subject to adjudication in Arizona, but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use, however, wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water. In Colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights, including priority of some of our rights for the Climax mine. Our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in New Mexico.




Water for our Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining operations is drawn from the Copiapó River aquifer. Because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years, studies have been ongoing to assess available supply for these operations. Based on these studies, we have begun to develop replacement supplies from renewable sources. We recently completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby waste water treatment facility to our Candelaria mine. We have also started engineering for the construction of a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater and a pipeline to convey the water to Candelaria. The plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.




Water for our El Abra mining operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de

Ascotán. In 2010, we obtained regulatory approval, subject to certain conditions, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán for the Sulfolix processing plant, which will begin operations in 2011. Failure to meet the specified conditions could adversely affect the Sulfolix processing plant. A change to the sulfide ore project, such as increased production or mill processing, would require additional water beyond our Sulfolix ground water pumping, which is permitted through 2021. El Abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing.




Water for our Cerro Verde mining operations comes from a series of storage reservoirs in the Rio Chili watershed that collect runoff from seasonal precipitation. Our Cerro Verde mining operations recently constructed new water reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed to obtain additional water rights and to expand storage capacity in the watershed. Due to occasional drought and possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our operations as currently planned. Cerro Verde is conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects.




Although each operation has sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights, claims and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or close mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities.




Increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow.




Energy represents approximately 20 percent of our production costs. An inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits, cash flow and growth opportunities. Our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations, such as sulphuric acid, grinding media, steel, reagents, liners, explosives and diluents. The prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements. Increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable. Increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects.




In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area.




Our Grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in Indonesia. Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.




In October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. In December 2003, a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. The events caused us to alter our short-term mine sequencing plans, which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production. We resumed normal production activities in second-quarter 2004.




In March 2006, a mud/topsoil slide involving approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining facilities. Three contract workers were fatally injured in the event. The material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area. As a result of investigations by PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides. The existing early warning system for potential slides, based upon rainfall and other factors, has also been expanded.




In September 2008, a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred at our Grasberg open pit. There were no injuries or property damage. The event caused a delay in our access to the high-grade section of the open pit and, as a result, a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half

of 2008 was deferred to future periods.




No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.




Our Africa mining operation, Tenke Fungurume, involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).




Our Tenke Fungurume mining operation is located in a remote area of the DRC and is subject to additional challenges, including:








·  


Severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance;











·  


Limited and possibly unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained;











·  


Challenges in obtaining experienced personnel;











·  


Security risks; and











·  


Limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria and cholera.







For example, due to limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from our Tenke Fungurume mining operation approximately 1,900 miles to ports in South Africa. The Tenke Fungurume mining operation and future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development.




An interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations.




Our mining operations and development projects require significant energy, principally electricity, diesel, coal and natural gas. Our South America mining operations receive electrical power under long-term contracts with local energy companies. Our Africa mining operation has entered into long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the state-owned electric utility company serving the Katanga province of the DRC. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure, or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.




The volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated.




Our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards, and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data. Estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations, and estimates may change as new data becomes available. Because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals, our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time.




Additionally, because the determination of reserves is based partially on estimates of future selling prices, a sustained decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves. These factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period.




There are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles. The quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. The volume and grade of ore reserves recovered, rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated. During fourth-quarter 2010, revised recovery rate estimates at El Abra resulted in a reduction of 163 million pounds in leach stockpiles.

We must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.




Our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our long-term viability. Produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. Exploration is highly speculative in nature. Our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result, 
there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful. There is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.




Development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.




There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects, including the development of underground mines in the Grasberg minerals district and our development of a large sulfide deposit at our El Abra mine. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics. Moreover, underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs, including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems. Thus it is possible
 that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates.




New development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. These development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies, acquisition of governmental permits, acquisition of land, power and water, and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects. It is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project, in which case, the project may not proceed, either on its original timing or at all. It is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase, resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures.




The development of underground mines is subject to additional risks, including the following:








·  


Unanticipated geologic, geotechnical and hydrogeologic conditions;











·  


Challenges related to hiring and training the personnel required for the ramp up in underground mining activities;











·  


Larger than expected dilution of ore associated with block caving and stoping mining methods; and











·  


Unanticipated delays in the development of major access and supporting infrastructure due to engineering changes, late delivery of critical components and longer than planned construction periods.







Some of these risks could result in a delay to production start up and a loss or reduction in minable tons. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.




Environmental risks




Our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs.




Our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration, development, production, occupational health, mine safety, toxic 

 



  



47







Table of Contents



 

substances, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, and other related matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased regulatory enforcement, increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment, supplies, labor and other factors. The Federal Clean Air Act has had a significant impact, particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants. Any change in waste management regulation of the mining industry under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act could have a significant impact, both on operational compliance and closure costs. In addition, environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could substantially increase 
compliance costs or adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities.




In addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites, we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.




Freeport-McMoRan Corporation (FMC, formerly Phelps Dodge), and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining, milling, and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. With the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them, irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators,
 meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the clean-up, although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. At December 31, 2010, we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the U.S. in 27 states.




We incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditure and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations of $372 million in 2010, $289 million in 2009 and $377 million in 2008. The increase in environmental capital spending for 2010, compared with 2009, primarily related to settlement of legal proceedings (refer to Note 13 for further discussion). For 2011, we expect to incur approximately $460 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs, which are part of our overall 2011 operating budget and primarily relates to ongoing environmental compliance.




At December 31, 2010, $1.4 billion of environmental obligations were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our environmental obligation estimates are based upon (1) our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago, (2) our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake the estimated costs of those activities, which are subject to varying interpretations, and (3) our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the expected clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. Significant adjustments to these estimates
 are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. Refer to Note 13 for more information on our environmental obligations.




An adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us.




As described in Note 13 and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”, we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation involving environmental cleanup costs, alleged environmental toxic torts and interpretations of environmental regulations. An adverse ruling in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations.




Our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and mined-land reclamation obligations. These requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so. In general, our domestic mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required. It is uncertain how potential EPA requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the 
scope of closure activities.

 

In addition, our international mines are subject to various mine closure and mined-land reclamation laws, and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both Peru and Chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation.

 

At December 31, 2010, our asset retirement obligations (AROs), determined as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. totaled $856 million (including $405 million for our New Mexico operations, $214 million for our Arizona operations and $129 million for PT Freeport Indonesia). ARO cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure or financial assurance regulations, engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, mine plans, cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs.




Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets.




Many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change. In 2010, our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, were approximately 10 million metric tons, divided between direct (56 percent) and indirect (44 percent) emissions. Most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks, followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting, smelting and other processes. Indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations. Approximately 64 percent of our direct emissions are in Indonesia, 21 percent in North America and 10 percent in South America. Approximately 56 percent of our indirect emiss
ions are in North America and 42 percent in South America.




A number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes regarding greenhouse gas emissions, although several of these regulatory changes are being challenged at both the federal and state levels. For example, in the U.S., the EPA issued final regulations in September 2009 requiring mandatory monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in specified circumstances, commencing in 2010. Our Miami smelter and El Paso refinery are required to report their emissions under this program. In June 2010, the EPA issued final regulations under the Clean Air Act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources of greenhouse gases and major modifications to large stationary sources of greenhouse gases. The Miami smelter is our only operation directly affected by these regulations. However, these regul
ations in conjunction with upcoming EPA regulations for large fossil fuel fired power plants may result in increased energy costs at our operations. Several states have also initiated action on their own or as part of regional organizations, such as the Western Climate Initiative, to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. New Mexico has promulgated regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from large sources and to join the Western Climate Initiative. These actions will likely impact our New Mexico operations through increased energy costs. The U.S. may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could lead to new regulations affecting our U.S. operations. The December 1997 Kyoto Protocol established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified the Protocol. Although the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, has not been ratified by the U.S., the U.S. continues to participate in global climate summits that may lead to a
n agreement in the future.




Since 2006, we have participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project, which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts. In 2009, we formed a multi-departmental greenhouse gas task force. Under the direction of this task force, we actively pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including evaluating 

 



  



49







Table of Contents



 

potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from our haul trucks. However, as a result of possible increases in production rates and longer and steeper haul profiles for the next several years, we also expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions.




From a medium and long-term perspective, we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. In addition, the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase, if they incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time, given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate.




The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.




Our operating, inactive and historical U.S. mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with, or result from, our mining operations.




A number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize, regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations. For example, the EPA could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) and their impacts at mining operations. In addition, several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials, including uranium. Radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits, including both our current and discontinued operations. Consequently, our copper operations may generate, concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation
. The impact of such future regulation on our operating, closure, reclamation, and remediation costs is uncertain.




Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.




Mining operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Government of Indonesia, uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been engineered and constructed to limit and help contain the footprint of tailings impact in the lowlands.




Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which, if not properly managed, can have a negative impact on the environment.




Certain Indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.




In connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian government, we committed to perform a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002. We developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel, which included

representatives from the Indonesian government, academia and non-governmental organizations. The risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents.




Since 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia has participated in the Government of Indonesia’s PROPER (Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating) program. In November 2010, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment announced the latest results of its PROPER environmental management audit, and gave PT Freeport Indonesia a Blue rating acknowledging PT Freeport Indonesia’s environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in Indonesia and also making several recommendations for improvement.




International risks




Our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries.




We are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru, Chile and the DRC. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries. Such risks include (1) renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts, (2) expropriation or nationalization of property, (3) changes in a foreign country’s laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, (4) political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerilla activities, 
insurrection and terrorism, (5) foreign exchange controls, and (6) the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. Our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.




In October 2010, PT Freeport Indonesia received from the Indonesian tax authorities an assessment for additional taxes approximating $106 million and interest approximating $52 million related to various audit exceptions for 2005. PT Freeport Indonesia has filed objections to these assessments because it believes that it has properly paid taxes for the year 2005 and is working with the Indonesian tax authorities to resolve this matter.




In December 2009, PT Freeport Indonesia was notified by the Large Taxpayer’s Office of the Government of Indonesia that PT Freeport Indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000. The amount of taxes and penalties would be significant. PT Freeport Indonesia believes that pursuant to the terms of its Contract of Work, it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after December 30, 2009. PT Freeport Indonesia has not received an assessment and is working with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter.




In December 2008, Cerro Verde was notified by SUNAT, the Peruvian national tax authority, of its intent to assess mining royalties related to the minerals processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which was added to Cerro Verde’s processing facilities in late 2006. In August 2009, Cerro Verde received an assessment approximating $34 million in connection with its alleged obligations for mining royalties and penalties for the period from October 2006 to December 2007. In April 2010, SUNAT issued a ruling denying Cerro Verde’s protest of the assessment, and in May 2010, Cerro Verde appealed this decision to the Tax Court. Cerro Verde has also received an assessment approximating $41 million in mining royalties and penalties for the year 2008. In February 2011, SUNAT issued a ruling denying Cerro Verde’s protest of the ass
essment for the year 2008, and Cerro Verde is in the process of appealing this decision to the Tax Court. Cerro Verde has also received a request for information for mining royalties covering the year 2009. SUNAT may continue to assess mining royalties annually until this matter is resolved by the Tax Court. Cerro Verde is challenging these royalties because its stability agreement with the Peruvian government exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. If Cerro Verde is ultimately found responsible for these royalties, it will also be liable for interest, which accrues at rates that range from 7 to 18 percent based on the year accrued and the currency in which the amounts would be payable. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate amount of the October 2006 to December 2007 assessment with interest approximated $57 million, and the aggregate amount of the 2008 assessment with interest approximated $61 million. These am
ounts will continue to increase at varying interest rates.

Because our Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia remains our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social uncertainties.




Indonesia has faced political, economic and social uncertainties, including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. In particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule over the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located, and have sought political independence for the province. In response, Indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws, which became effective January 1, 2001. The manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces, including Papua, are uncertain and are ongoing issues in Indonesian politics. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military.
 Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities.




Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among Indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government. Partially because of their significance to Indonesia’s economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the Indonesian press and in political debates, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence.




Between July 2009 and January 2010 there were a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our Grasberg mining complex. In connection with these incidents, there were three fatalities (including one PT Freeport Indonesia employee, a security contractor and an Indonesian policeman) and several injuries. The Indonesian government responded with additional security forces and expressed a strong commitment to protect the safety of the community and of our operations.




PT Freeport Indonesia operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a four-day period in April 2007, as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits. The protests ended with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for workers and PT Freeport Indonesia returned to normal operations. The impacts to production were not significant.




Illegal miners have continued to operate along the river designated to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in PT Freeport Indonesia’s government-approved tailings management area. The illegal miners who have trespassed from time to time in the area of our facilities have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. In 2006, the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill in protest, and PT Freeport Indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure.




We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our Indonesian operations, or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations. If additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities, they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time.




We do not expect to mine all of our Indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our Contract of Work in Indonesia expires.




All of our Indonesian proven and probable ore reserves, including the Grasberg deposit, are located in Block A, and the initial term of our Contract of Work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021. We can extend this term for two successive 10-year periods, subject to the approval of the Indonesian government, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 (i.e., through the expiration of the two 10-year extensions) and our current mine plan has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our Contract of Work, and there can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approv
e the extensions. Prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 32 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2010, representing 38 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and 51 percent of its share of

recoverable gold reserves.




In 2008, Indonesia enacted a new mining law, which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to PT Freeport Indonesia. In 2010, the Government of Indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work.  The regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration. However, the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our Contract of Work provides for two 10-year extension periods under the existing terms of the Contract of Work.




Our Contracts of Work in Indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel.




PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work and other Contracts of Work in which we have an interest were entered into under Indonesia’s 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. Our Contracts of Work can be terminated by the Government of Indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.




Certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our Contract of Work. Although our Contract of Work grants to PT Freeport Indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the Contract of Work, certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements.




At times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior to May 1998 (i.e., during the Suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the Contracts of Work will not be challenged for political or other reasons. PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work and our other Contracts of Work require that disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Consequently, if a dispute arises under the Contracts of Work, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute
, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory.




Indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with Indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the Contracts of Work. In 2006, the Government of Indonesia created a joint team for “Periodic Evaluation on Implementation of the PT-FI Contract of Work” to conduct an evaluation every five years. The team consists of five working groups, whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies, covering production, state revenues, community development, environmental issues and security issues. We have conducted numerous meetings with these groups. The joint team has indicated that it will issue a report. While we believe that we comply with PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that the report will s
upport that conclusion. Separately, the Indonesian House of Representatives created a working committee on PT Freeport Indonesia. Members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in Jakarta. We will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work.




Any suspension of required activities under our Contracts of Work requires the consent of the Indonesian government.




Our Contracts of Work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities, including exploration, for a period of one year by making a written request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the approval of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension, then we are required to continue our activities under the Contract of Work or potentially be declared in default. Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the Indonesian government has not approved such continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the Contract of Work.

We suspended our field exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues, in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective Contract of Work areas outside of Block A.</f

Our Tenke Fungurume mining operation is located in the Katanga province of the DRC, and may be adversely affected by political, economic and social instability in the DRC.

 

During 2009, we completed construction activities for the initial Tenke Fungurume development project, which is located in the DRC. Since gaining independence in 1960, the DRC has undergone outbreaks of violence, changes in national leadership and financial crisis. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. As part of a review of all mining contracts by the Ministry of Mines (Ministry) in the DRC, in February 2008, we received notification that the Ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A.R.L.’s (TFM) mining concessions. In October 2010, the government of the DRC an
nounced the conclusion of the review of TFM’s mining contracts. The conclusion of the review process confirmed that TFM’s existing mining contracts are in good standing and acknowledged the rights and benefits granted under those contracts. In connection with the review, TFM made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). In December 2010, the addenda to TFM’s Amended and Restated Mining Convention and Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement were signed by the parties and are pending a Presidential Decree. TFM’s existing mining contracts will be in effect until a Presidential Decree is obtained. After giving effect to the amendments and obtaining approval of the modification to TFM’s bylaws, our effective ownership interest in the project will be 56.0 percent, compared to our current ownership interest of 57.75 percent.




In July 2009, TFM was advised that the Minister of Justice in the DRC authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with the securing of labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the Tenke Fungurume project. Several government officials and three TFM employees were arrested. In October 2009, the three TFM employees were tried and acquitted. One government official, the head of immigration in the Katanga province, was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement. The office of the Attorney General of the DRC filed a notice of appeal of the judgment, and the matter is pending at the Appellate Court.




In July 2009, TFM entered into a settlement agreement with DRC tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors, including short-term workers. Pursuant to the agreement, which covers the period from January 2007 to the date of the settlement, TFM paid approximately $16 million in fees and penalties. The procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for short-term workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the DRC, and TFM continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the government authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law. In connection with this matter, we notified the U.S. government enforcement authorities about
 our internal investigation of the immigration work permit and visa matter and the associated criminal case. We have received and responded to requests from U.S. government authorities related to the matter and to other requests for information about our compliance program.




Other political, economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include:








·  


Political risks associated with the relatively recent establishment of the present government and the upcoming presidential election scheduled for November 2011;











·  


Cancellation or renegotiation of mining contracts by the government;




 



  



54







Table of Contents



 





·  


Legal and regulatory uncertainties, governmental corruption and bribery;











·  


Royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities, including retroactive claims;











·  


Security risks due to the remote location in the southern DRC and violence in the northeastern provinces of the DRC;











·  


Risk of loss of property due to expropriation or nationalization of property; and











·  


Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism.







Consequently, our Tenke Fungurume mining operations and future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.




Terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business.




In July 2009, two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, that are reported to have killed nine people and injured 53 others. Two of our Indonesian-based executives were injured in the incident.




In July 2009, a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our Grasberg mining complex and vandalized vehicles and small buildings. There were no injuries. For more information about a series of shooting incidents near our Grasberg mining complex, see the risk factor “Because our Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia remains our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social uncertainties” above.




In August 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport Indonesia’s personnel reside. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in Tembagapura, their family members and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander of the Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian police, accompanied by FBI agents, arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other Papuans. In November 2006, verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the August 2002
 shooting, including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack.




In October 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted. In August, 2003, 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. In September 2004, 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the Australian embassy in Jakarta. In October 2005, three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in Bali. The same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005, Indonesian police raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of other accused terr
orists linked to the bombings discussed above. Our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents, but PT Freeport Indonesia’s corporate office in Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the Australian embassy. In addition to the Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been anti-American demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led by radical Islamic activists.




No assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur. If there were to be additional violence, it could materially and adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

Other risks




If market prices for our commodities decline, the carrying values of inventories and long-lived assets may be further impaired, which could require charges to operating income that could be material.




During fourth-quarter 2008, we concluded that the then-current economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.  As a result, we recorded impairment charges totaling $16.9 billion ($12.6 billion to net loss attributable to common stockholders). Refer to Note 17 for further discussion.




The declines in copper and molybdenum prices in late 2008 also resulted in lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory charges totaling $782 million ($479 million to net loss attributable to common stockholders) in 2008. Additional LCM charges associated with molybdenum inventories totaling $19 million ($15 million to net income attributable to common stockholders) were recorded in first-quarter 2009. We recorded no further LCM inventory adjustments subsequent to first-quarter 2009.




Declines in the market price of copper, among other factors, could cause us to record additional LCM inventory adjustments and could also result in an additional write down of the carrying value of long-lived assets, which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders' equity, but would have no effect on cash flows.




Unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.




We are a party to the litigation described in Note 13 and in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters, including asbestos exposure cases, disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites, disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. If any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms, or otherwise affects our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on o
ur operating results and financial condition.




We depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business.




Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects. A loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected.




Our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends.




We are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. In addition, cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.




In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including any trade creditors.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.




Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:








·  


Authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;











·  


Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;











·  


Limit removal of directors for cause only;











·  


Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and











·  


Require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.







These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors.




In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.




These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
