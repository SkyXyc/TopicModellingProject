.—Risk Factors and Item 3.—Legal Proceedings.Business Lines & SBUsWithin our six SBUs, as discussed above, we have two lines of business. The first business line is generation, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The second business line is utilities, where we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.For each SBU, the following table summarizes our generation and utility businesses by capacity, number of facilities, utility customers and utility GWh sold.5SBUGeneration Capacity (Gross MW) Generation Facilities Utility Customers Utility GWh Utility BusinessesUS         Generation5,825 12      Utilities6,520 18 1.1 million 34,797 2Andes         Generation8,032 32      Brazil         Generation3,298 13      Utilities    8.0 million 57,274 2MCAC         Generation3,140 13      Utilities    1.3 million 3,620 4Europe         Generation6,699 11      Asia         Generation1,218 3       34,732(1) 102 10.4 million 95,691 8(1) 27,595 proportional MW. Proportional MW is equal to gross MW of a generation facility times AES’ equity ownership percentage in such facility.StrategyIn 2011, we implemented a new strategy to maximize value for our shareholders and over the last three years we have made significant progress towards our goals by executing on the following pillars:•Reducing Complexity. By exiting businesses and markets where we do not have a competitive advantage, we have simplified our portfolio and reduced risk. Over the past three years, we have sold assets to generate $3.0 billion in equity proceeds for AES, decreasing the total number of countries where we have operations from 28 to 18. We exited several of these markets, including Ukraine, Turkey and Africa, at opportune times, as risks for these businesses have increased since the sales, which we believe would have adversely impacted the valuations of such businesses. In 2014, we raised $1.8 billion in asset sales proceeds and exited three countries.•Leveraging Our Platforms. We are focusing our growth on platform expansions, including adjacencies, in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. We currently have 7,141 MW under construction — the most in AES' 34-year history. These projects represent $9 billion in total capital expenditures, with the majority of AES' $1.5 billion in equity already funded and we expect all of these projects to come on-line from 2015 through 2018. In 2014, we brought on-line the 247 MW heavy fuel oil-fired IPP4 power plant in Jordan and broke ground on six new construction projects, totaling 2,226 MW.  Beyond the projects we currently have under construction, we will continue to advance select projects from our 12,000 MW development pipeline, including traditional power plants and adjacencies, such as energy storage. Adjacencies are smaller investments that add near-term growth and can be replicated across our portfolio. We are already successful - AES is the world leader in battery-based energy storage, with 228 MW (power plant equivalent dispatchable resource, including supply and load capability) in operation or under construction.◦AES has the most comprehensive and accomplished fleet of battery-based energy storage in the world◦U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts 28,000 MW of new renewable capacity in the next ten years and 82,000 MW of power plant retirements over the same period▪Energy storage can serve as a replacement resource, to absorb renewable energy◦AES Advancion is a complete battery-based grid resource offered to utility companies and renewable developers▪Tailored to specific market needs in terms of power and duration•Performance Excellence. We strive to be a low-cost manager of a portfolio of international energy assets and to derive synergies and scale from our businesses. We have reduced our global general & administrative expenses ("G&A") by $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011 one year early. •Expanding Access to Capital. We have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES by building strategic partnerships at the project and business level. Through these partnerships, we aim to optimize our risk-adjusted returns in our existing businesses and growth projects. By selling down portions of certain businesses, we can adjust our global exposure to commodity, fuel, country and macroeconomic risks. Partial sell-downs of our assets can serve to highlight the value of businesses in our portfolio. In 2014, we brought in partners at four of our businesses:◦CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Quebec, Canada, recently purchased direct and indirect interests in IPALCO, the Parent Company of IPL in Indiana, for $595 million. ◦At Guacolda in Chile, we brought in Global Infrastructure Partners to acquire a 50% stake by investing $728 million, which allowed us to improve operations, without changing our ownership stake.6◦At Masinloc in the Philippines, Electricity Generating Company Limited ("EGCO"), a Thailand-based Independent Power Producer, took an indirect stake in the existing business, as well as potential expansion opportunities, for $443 million. AES and EGCO agreed to use the Masinloc platform as their exclusive vehicle for growth in the Philippines.◦At AES Dominicana in the Dominican Republic, we sold a minority interest in the business to the Estrella and Linda Groups, for $84 million, valuing our assets in the country at $1.2 billion. Estrella and Linda Groups represents strong local players and will support our planned platform expansions, such as upgrading our DPP power plant in the Dominican Republic.•Allocating Capital in a Disciplined Manner. Our top priority is to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, which we achieve by investing our discretionary cash and recycling the capital we receive from asset sales and strategic partnerships. To that end, since September 2011 we have repurchased $985 million of our shares and benefited from a low interest rate environment, by transacting on $18 billion in debt deals at the Parent and our subsidiaries. These debt transactions represent $9 billion in refinancing and $9 billion in new financing and extended the maturities on $2.9 billion in Parent debt. Note: Investments in Subsidiaries excludes $2.3 billion investment in DPL.Most recently, we doubled our regular dividend, increasing the quarterly payment to $0.10 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2015. This dividend increase reflects our confidence in the predictability and growth of our cash flow.GenerationWe currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 28,212 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities. Our generation fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs.Performance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, fuel costs, fixed-cost management, sourcing and competition.Electricity Sales ContractsOur generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts (“contract sales”) or under short-term agreements in competitive markets (“short-term sales”).Contract Sales. Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts. Our medium-term contract sales have a term of 2 to 5 years, while our long-term contracts have a term of more than 5 years. Across our portfolio, the average remaining contract term is 7 years.In contract sales, our generation businesses recover variable costs including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion under Fuel Costs). These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel prices and electricity prices by linking the 7business’s revenues and costs. These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.Capacity Payments and Contract Sales. Most of our contract sales include a capacity payment that covers projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payment be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs, including debt and return on capital invested. Although our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt, we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. For foreign exchange, we generally structure the revenue of the business to match the currency of the debt and fixed costs. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales section.Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.Short-Term Sales. Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with an average term of less than 2 years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market, or, in some cases, at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves. In certain markets, such as Argentina and Kazakhstan, a regulator establishes the prices for electricity and fuel and adjusts them periodically for inflation, changes in fuel prices and other factors. In these cases, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales. Many of the markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. Our most significant capacity revenues are earned by our generation capacity in Ohio and Northern Ireland.Plant Reliability and Flexibility Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue, meeting local market needs.Fuel CostsFor our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts have periodic adjustments for changes in fuel cost indices. In those cases, we have fuel supply agreements with shorter terms to match those adjustments. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10-K.35% of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A few exceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we purchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market.830% of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the United States, most of our plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants and at our plant in Hawaii, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.29% of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, wind and energy storage, which do not have significant fuel costs.6% of our generation fleet utilizes oil, diesel and petroleum coke (“pet coke”) for fuel. Oil and diesel are sourced locally at prices linked to international markets, while pet coke is largely sourced from Mexico and the U.S. Renewable Generation FacilitiesWe currently own and operate 8,221 MW (4,364 proportional MW) of renewable generation, including hydro, wind, energy storage, biomass and landfill gas.Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic ActivityOur generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns throughout the year and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis, Key Trends and Uncertainties of this Form 10-K for further details of the impact of dry hydrological conditions. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.Fixed-Cost Management In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed operating and maintenance costs are recovered through the capacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.CompetitionFor our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.UtilitiesAES’ eight utility businesses distribute power to more than 10 million people in three countries. AES’ two utilities in the United States also include generation capacity totaling 6,520 MW. The utility businesses have a variety of structures, ranging from integrated utility to pure transmission and distribution businesses.In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, reliability of service and competition.Regulated Rate of Return and TariffIn exchange for the exclusive right to sell or distribute electricity in a franchise area, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the prices (“tariffs”) that our utilities are allowed to charge retail customers for electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility’s allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility’s earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon a certain usage level and may include a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy. In addition to fuel and purchased energy, other types of costs may be passed through to customers via an existing mechanism, such as certain environmental expenditures that are covered under an environmental tracker at our utility in Indiana, IPL. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand 9above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract with other retail energy suppliers directly and pay a wheeling and other non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and non-technical losses. Utilities therefore need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic ActivityOur utility businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns throughout the year and, therefore, the operating revenues and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions and customers’ historic usage levels and patterns. The retail kWh sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.Reliability of ServiceOur utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may be specific with incentives or penalties for performance against these standards. In other cases, the standards are implicit and the utility must operate to meet customer expectations.CompetitionOur integrated utilities, such as IPL and DP&L, operate as the sole distributor of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. Our businesses own and operate all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Competition in the regulated electric business is primarily from the on-site generation for industrial customers; however, in Ohio, customers in our service territory have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their generation service. Our integrated utilities, particularly DP&L, are exposed to the volatility in wholesale prices to the extent our generating capacity exceeds the native load served under the regulated tariff and short-term contracts. See the full discussion under the US SBU.At our pure transmission and distribution businesses, such as those in Brazil and El Salvador, we face relatively limited competition due to significant barriers to entry. At many of these businesses, large customers, as defined by the relevant regulator, have the option to both leave and return to regulated service.Development and Construction We develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility businesses, new plants may be built in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments and are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is platform expansion opportunities, where we can add on to our existing facilities in our key platform markets where we have a competitive advantage. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment and share buybacks.In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners where it is commercially attractive. For construction, we typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project’s budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.Environmental MattersWe are subject to various international, federal, state, and local regulations in all of our markets. These regulations govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity.We are also subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. Violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, other sanctions, suspension or revocation of permits and/or facility shutdowns. See later in Item 1.—Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations for further regulatory and environmental discussion.10SBUsAll SBUs include generation facilities and three include utility businesses. The Company measures the operating performance of its SBUs using Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure (see definition below).AES’ primary sources of Revenue, Operating Margin and Adjusted PTC are from generation and utility businesses. The Adjusted PTC by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2014 is shown below. The percentages shown are the contribution by each SBU to gross Adjusted PTC, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for reconciliation.In 2014, approximately 79% of Adjusted PTC was contributed by our businesses in the Americas —including the US, Andes, Brazil and MCAC SBUs. Asia and Europe accounted for the remaining 21%.We define Adjusted PTC as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis, adjusted for the aforementioned items. Adjusted PTC in each SBU includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other SBUs other than interest and charges for certain management services.Our Organization and SegmentsThe segment reporting structure uses the Company’s management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the business internally and is organized by geographic regions which provide better socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The management reporting structure is organized along six SBUs — led by our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”):•US SBU•Andes SBU•Brazil SBU•MCAC SBU•Europe SBU•Asia SBUCorporate and Other—For financial reporting purposes, the Company’s Corporate activities are reported within “Corporate and Other” because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17—Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company’s segment structure used for financial reporting purposes.“Corporate and Other” also includes costs related to corporate overhead which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. See Note 17—Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for information on revenue from external customers, Adjusted PTC (a non-GAAP measure) and total assets by segment.11The following describes our businesses within our six SBUs: US SBU Our US SBU has 12 generation facilities and two integrated utilities in the United States. Our US operations accounted for 23%, 21% and 20% of consolidated AES operating margin and 24%, 24% and 20% of AES Adjusted PTC (a non-GAAP measure) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The percentages reflect the contribution by our US SBU to gross operating margin and adjusted PTC before deductions for Corporate.The following table provides highlights of our US operations:Generation Capacity 12,345 gross MW (12,345 proportional MW)Generation Facilities 15 (including 3 under construction)Key Generation Businesses Southland, Hawaii and US WindUtilities Penetration 1,125,000 customers (34,797 GWh)Utility Businesses 2 integrated utilities (includes 18 generation plants)Key Utility Businesses IPL and DPLOperating installed capacity of our US SBU totals 12,345 MW.

In addition to the above, DP&L also owns a 4.9% equity ownership in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two plants in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of approximately 2,109 MW. DP&L’s share of this generation capacity is approximately 103 MW. DPL Energy, LLC plants: Tait Units 4-7 and Montpelier Units 1-4.(2) IPL plants: Eagle Valley, Georgetown, Harding Street and Petersburg.The following map illustrates the location of our US facilities:US BusinessesUS UtilitiesIPALCOBusiness Description. IPALCO owns all of the outstanding common stock of IPL. IPL is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy to approximately 480,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana. IPL has an exclusive right to provide electric service to those customers. IPL’s service area covers about 528 square miles with a population of approximately 928,000. IPL owns and operates four generating stations. Two of the generating stations are primarily coal-fired. The third station has a combination of units that use coal 13(baseload capacity), natural gas and/or oil (peaking capacity) for fuel to produce electricity. The fourth station is a small peaking station that uses gas-fired combustion turbine technology for the production of electricity. IPL’s net electric generation capacity for winter is 3,241 MW and net summer capacity is 3,123 MW. On December 15, 2014, the Company executed an agreement with CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Quebec, Canada. Pursuant to the agreement, CDPQ purchased 15% of AES US Investments, Inc. ("AES US Investments"), a wholly owned subsidiary of AES that owns 100% of IPALCO, for $247 million. This transaction closed on February 11, 2015. In addition, CDPQ will invest approximately $349 million in IPALCO through 2016, in exchange for a 17.65% equity stake, funding existing growth and environmental projects at IPL. Upon completion of these transactions, CDPQ’s direct and indirect interests in IPALCO will total 30%, AES will own 85% of AES US Investments, and AES US Investment will own 82.35% of IPALCO. There will be no change in management or operational control of AES US Investments or IPALCO as a result of these transactions.Market Structure. IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in the MISO. MISO is a RTO, which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the US. IPL offers the available electricity production of each of its generation assets into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. MISO operates on a merit order dispatch, considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. Regulatory FrameworkRetail Ratemaking. In addition to the regulations referred to below in “Other Regulatory Matters”, IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to IPL’s services and facilities; retail rates and charges; the issuance of long-term securities; and certain other matters. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL’s business is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. IPL’s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges, which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. The IURC gives consideration to all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes including a fair return on the fair value of the utility property used and useful in providing service to customers. In addition, IPL’s rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, those to reflect changes in fuel costs to generate electricity or purchased power prices, referred to as FAC, and for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations referred to as ECCRA. These components function somewhat independently of one another, but the overall structure of IPL’s rates and charges would be subject to review at the time of any review of IPL’s basic rates and charges. IPL’s basic rates and charges were last adjusted in 1996; however, IPL filed a petition with the IURC on December 29, 2014 for authority to increase its basic rates and charges by approximately $67.8 million annually, or 5.6%. Hearings have begun on this proceeding and an order on this proceeding will likely be issued in the fourth quarter of 2015 with any rate change expected to become effective by early 2016.Environmental MattersMATS. In April 2012, the EPA’s rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for each hazardous air pollutant regulated under the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired power plants, known as MATS, became effective. On August 14, 2013, the IURC approved IPL’s MATS plan, which includes investing up to $511 million in the installation of new pollution control equipment on IPL’s five largest baseload generating units. These coal-fired units are located at IPL’s Petersburg and Harding Street generating stations. Pursuant to an Indiana statute, the IURC also approved IPL’s request to recover operating and construction costs for this equipment (including a return) through a rate adjustment mechanism, with certain stipulations. Funding for these capital expenditures is expected to be obtained from additional debt financing at IPL; equity contributions; borrowing capacity on IPL’s committed credit facilities; and cash generated from operating activities.Replacement Generation. IPL has several generating units that are expected to retire or refuel in the next few years. These units are primarily coal-fired and represent 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this generation, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC in April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to 725 MW CCGT at its Eagle Valley Station site in Indiana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (106 MW net capacity each). In May 2014, IPL received an order on the CPCN from the IURC authorizing the refueling project and granting approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at a total budget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $626 million. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance for debt and equity funds used during construction, and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project until such time that IPL is allowed to collect a return. The CCGT is expected to be placed into service in April 2017, and the refueling project is expected to be completed in early 2016. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and for the refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after the assets have been placed in service. In October 2014, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC seeking a CPCN to refuel Harding Street Station Unit 7 from coal to natural gas (about 410 MW net capacity). This conversion is part of IPL’s overall wastewater compliance plan for its power plants (as discussed in Environmental Wastewater Requirements below).14Environmental Wastewater Requirements. In August 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Harding Street, and Eagle Valley generating stations, which became effective in October 2012. In April 2013, IPL received an extension to the compliance deadline through September 2017 as part of an agreed order with IDEM. IPL conducted studies to determine the operational changes and/or control equipment necessary in order to comply with the new limitations. On October 16, 2014, IPL filed its wastewater compliance plans with the IURC. IPL is seeking approval for a CPCN to install and operate wastewater treatment technologies at its Petersburg Plant and Harding Street Station, as well as for the refueling of Unit 7 at Harding Street. If approved, IPL will invest $332 million in these projects to ensure compliance with the wastewater treatment requirements by 2017. IPL cannot predict the impact of these regulations on IPL’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but it is expected to be material. Recovery of these costs is expected through an Indiana statute which allows for 80% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism with the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery in the next basic rate case proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that IPL would be successful in that regard. Key Financial Drivers IPL’s financial results are driven primarily by retail demand and rate base growth. Retail demand is influenced by local macroeconomic conditions. In addition, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices could also impact financial results. IPL’s rate base growth is influenced by the timely recovery of capital expenditures, as well as passage of new legislation or implementation of regulations.Construction and Development IPL’s construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. Please see Environmental Matters above for a description of our major construction projects.DPL Inc. ("DPL")Business Description. DPL is an energy holding company whose principal subsidiaries include DP&L, DPLE, and DPLER. DP&L generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to more than 515,000 customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. DP&L, solely or through jointly owned facilities, owns 2,510 MW of generation capacity and numerous transmission facilities. DPLE owns peaking generation units representing 556 MW located in Ohio and Indiana. DPLER, a competitive retail marketer, sells retail electricity to more than 260,000 retail customers in Ohio and Illinois. Approximately 131,000 of these customers are also distribution customers of DP&L in Ohio. Market Structure Customer Switching. Since January 2001, electric customers within Ohio have been permitted to choose to purchase power under a contract with a CRES Provider or continue to purchase power from their local utility under SSO rates established by tariff. DP&L and other Ohio utilities continue to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in their state certified territories, and DP&L has the obligation to supply retail generation service to customers that do not choose an alternative supplier. Beginning in 2014, a portion of the SSO generation supply is no longer supplied by DP&L but is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ten percent of the SSO load was sourced through competitive bid in 2014, and an additional 50% and 100% will be sourced in this manner in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services. The PUCO has issued extensive rules on how and when a customer can switch generation suppliers, how the local utility will interact with CRES Providers and customers, including for billing and collection purposes, and which elements of a utility’s rates are “bypassable” (i.e., avoided by a customer that elects a CRES Provider) and which elements are “non-bypassable” (i.e., charged to all customers receiving a distribution service irrespective of what entity provides the retail generation service). Several communities in DP&L’s service area have passed ordinances allowing the communities to become government aggregators for the purpose of offering retail generation service to their residences. PJM Operations. DP&L is a member of PJM. The PJM RTO operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. PJM has an integrated planning process to identify potential needs for additional transmission to be built to avoid future reliability problems. PJM also runs the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members. As a member of PJM, DP&L is also subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC. The RPM is PJM’s capacity construct. The purpose of the RPM is to enable PJM to obtain sufficient resources to reliably meet the needs of electric customers within the 15PJM footprint. PJM conducts an auction to establish the price by zone. DP&L’s capacity is located in the remainder of the RTO area within PJM.The PJM RPM auctions are held three years in advance for a period covering 12 months starting from June 1. Auctions for the period covering June 1, 2018 through May 30, 2019 are expected to take place in May 2015. Future auction results are dependent upon various factors including the demand and supply situation, capacity additions and retirements and any changes in the current auction rules related to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources in the RPM capacity auctions. For DPL-owned generation, applicable capacity prices and capacity cleared for periods through the auction year 2017/18 are as follows: Auction Year (June 01-May 31) 2017/18 2016/17 2015/16 2014/15 2013/14 2012/13Capacity Clearing Price ($/MW-Day) $120 $59 $136 $126 $28 $16Capacity Cleared (MW) 2,960 2,957 2,923 3,277 3,283 3,609On a calendar-year basis, capacity prices and annual capacity revenues earned or projected to be earned by DPL are as follows:Year 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013Computed Average Capacity Price ($/MW-Day) $95 $91 $132 $85 $23Computed Gross RPM Capacity Revenue ($ millions) $103 $97 $147 $107 $29According to the terms of DP&L’s RPM rider, a portion of the capacity revenue is credited to SSO customers primarily based on the load still being served to the SSO customers. Accordingly, in 2014, DP&L credited 29% of the RPM capacity revenue to SSO customers. However, with ongoing switching and transitioning to the market, the amount to be credited will decline each year until reaching zero by January 1, 2016.Regulatory FrameworkRetail Regulation. DP&L is subject to regulation by the PUCO, for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio, energy efficiency program requirements and certain other matters. DP&L’s rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges that are set and approved by the PUCO after public hearings. In addition, DP&L’s rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, those to reflect changes in fuel costs to generate electricity or purchased power prices, and the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with alternative energy, renewables, energy efficiency, and economic development costs. These components function independently of one another, but the overall structure of DP&L’s retail rates and charges are subject to the rules and regulations established by the PUCO. Retail Rate Structure. Since Ohio is deregulated and allows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider at SSO rates. SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established based on an Electric Security Plan (“ESP”) filing. DP&L’s wholesale transmission rates are regulated by the FERC. DP&L’s distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility’s allowed regulated asset base, capital structure and cost of capital.On October 5, 2012, DP&L filed an ESP with the PUCO to establish SSO rates that were to be in effect starting January 2013. An order was issued by the PUCO on September 4, 2013 and a correction to that order was issued on September 6, 2013 ("ESP Order"). After several rehearing requests the ESP Order was revised several times. Collectively, the ESP Orders state that DP&L’s current ESP began January 2014 and extends through May 31, 2017. The PUCO authorized DP&L to collect a non-bypassable SSR equal to $110 million per year for 2014 - 2016. The ESP Order also directed DP&L to divest its generation assets no later than January 1, 2017 and established DP&L’s Significantly Excessive Earnings Test ("SEET") threshold at a 12% ROE. Beginning in 2014, DP&L was no longer permitted to supply 100% of the generation service for SSO customers. Instead, the PUCO directed DP&L to phase in the competitive bidding structure with 10% of DP&L’s SSO load sourced through the competitive bid starting in 2014, 60% in 2015, and 100% by January 1, 2016. The ESP Order approved DP&L’s rate proposal to bifurcate its transmission charges into a non-bypassable component, Transmission Cost Recovery Rider - Nonbypassable ("TCRR-N") and a bypassable component, Transmission Cost Recovery Rider - Bypassable ("TCRR-B"). The ESP order also required DP&L to establish a $2.0 million per year shareholder funded economic development fund. In accordance with the ESP Order, on December 30, 2013, DP&L filed an application with the PUCO stating its plan to transfer or sell its generation assets. After a period of comments and response, DP&L filed amended applications on February 25, 2014 and May 23, 2014. On June 4, 2014, the PUCO issued a fourth entry on rehearing which reinstated the time by which DP&L must separate its generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets to no later than January 1, 2017. On July 14, 2014, DP&L publicly announced its decision to retain DP&L’s generation assets but to maintain its plans to transfer the 16assets to a separate affiliate of DPL in accordance with the PUCO orders by January 1, 2017. On September 17, 2014, the PUCO issued a Finding and Order which approved DP&L’s plan to separate its generation assets with minor modifications. These modifications denied DP&L’s request to defer costs associated with Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (which are not currently being recovered through existing rates) and ordered DP&L to transfer environmental liabilities with the generation assets.Environmental MattersIn relation to MATS, 3,066 MW of DPL’s generation capacity is largely compliant with MATS, and DPL does not expect to incur material capital expenditures to ensure compliance with MATS. For more information see Item 1.— United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.Key Financial DriversAlthough recent ESP and Generation Separation decisions provide some clarity on the underlying drivers through 2016, challenges remain for DPL beyond 2016.Through 2016, DPL financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•PJM capacity prices auctioned already (as discussed above)•Non-bypassable revenue: $110 million in 2014 and allowed to earn $110 million annually in 2015 and 2016•Customer switching, competitive bidding and SSO rates (as discussed above)•Retail margins earned at DPLERBeyond 2016, DPL financial drivers include many factors, such as the following:•PJM capacity prices•Recovery in the power market, particularly as it relates to an expansion in dark spreads•Sale or transfer to a DPL affiliate of DP&L generation assets•DPL’s ability to reduce its cost structure See .—Risk Factors for additional discussion on US regulatory matters.Our businesses are subject to emission regulations, which may result in increased operating costs or the purchase of additional pollution control equipment if emission levels are exceeded. Our businesses periodically review their obligations for compliance with environmental laws, including site restoration and remediation. Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued, if any. For a discussion of environmental laws and regulations affecting the US business, see Item1.—US Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations. Key Financial DriversUS Generation’s financial results are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into long-term fuel contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major maintenance requiring units to be off-line is 19performed during periods when power demand is typically lower. The financial results of US Wind are primarily driven by increased production due to faster and less turbulent wind, and reduced turbine outages. In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results for the wind projects that are operating without long-term contracts for all or some of their capacity. Construction and DevelopmentPlanned capital projects include the AES Southland re-powering described above and an energy storage project that will be adjacent to the existing Warrior Run coal plant located in Maryland. In addition to the new construction projects, US Generation performs capital projects related to major plant maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to be compliant with new environmental laws and regulations.Andes SBUOur Andes SBU has generation facilities in three countries — Chile, Colombia and Argentina. Our Andes operations accounted for 19%, 17% and 16% of consolidated AES Operating Margin and 23%, 19% and 18% of AES Adjusted PTC (a non-GAAP measure) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the two principal markets: the SIC and SING. In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Gener is the second largest generation operator in Chile with a calculated installed capacity of 3,440 MW, excluding energy storage and TermoAndes, and a market share of 17.9% as of December 31, 2014.AES Gener owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener’s installed capacity is located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener’s diverse generation portfolio, composed of hydroelectric, coal, gas, diesel and biomass facilities, allows the businesses to operate under a variety of market and hydrological conditions, manage AES Gener’s contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers and, as required, provide backup spot market energy to the SIC and SING. AES Gener has experienced significant growth in recent years responding to market opportunities with the completion of nine generation projects totaling approximately 1,700 MW and increasing AES Gener’s installed capacity by 49% from 2006 to 2014. Additionally, we are constructing an additional 1,276 MW, comprised of the 21 MW Andes Solar and 40 MW Cochrane Energy Storage in the SING, the 152 MW coal-fired Guacolda V in the SIC, the 532 MW coal-fired Cochrane plant in the SING and the 531 MW Alto Maipo run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant in the SIC.In Chile, we align AES Gener’s contracts with their efficient generation capacity, contracting a significant portion of their baseload capacity, currently coal and hydroelectric, under long-term contracts with a diversified customer base, including both regulated and unregulated customers. AES Gener reserves its higher variable cost units as designated backup facilities, principally the diesel- and gas-fired units in Chile, for sales to the spot market during scarce system supply conditions, such as dry hydrological conditions and plant outages. In Chile, sales on the spot market are made only to other generation companies that are members of the relevant CDEC at the system marginal cost.AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with average terms of 13 to 16 years, with regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include both fixed and variable payments along with indexation mechanisms that periodically adjust prices based on the generation cost structure related to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (“U.S. CPI”), the international price of coal, and in some cases, with pass-through of fuel and regulatory costs, including changes in law.In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives firm capacity payments for contributing to the system’s ability to meet peak demand. These payments are added to the final electricity price paid by both unregulated and regulated customers. In each system, the CDEC annually determines the firm capacity amount allocated to each power plant. A plant’s firm capacity is defined as the capacity that it can guarantee at peak hours during critical conditions, such as droughts, taking into account 22statistical information regarding maintenance periods and water inflows in the case of hydroelectric plants. The capacity price is fixed by the CNE in the semiannual node price report and indexed to the U.S. CPI and other relevant indices.Market Structure. Chile has four power systems, largely as a result of its geographic shape and size. The SIC is the largest of these systems, with an installed capacity of 15,181 MW as of December 31, 2014. The SIC serves approximately 92% of the Chilean population, including the densely populated Santiago Metropolitan Region, and represents 75% of the country’s electricity demand. The SING serves about 6% of the Chilean population, representing 24% of Chile’s electricity consumption, and is mostly oriented toward mining companies.In 2014, thermoelectric generation represented 64% of the total generation in Chile. In the SIC, thermoelectric generation represents 52% of installed capacity, required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric output and is critical to guaranteeing reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions. In the SING, which includes the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, thermoelectric capacity represents 95% of installed capacity. The fuels used for generation, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices.In the SIC, where hydroelectric plants represent a large part of the system’s installed capacity, hydrological conditions largely influence plant dispatch and, therefore, spot market prices, given that river flow volumes, melting snow and initial water levels in reservoirs largely determine the dispatch of the system’s hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants. Rainfall and snowfall occur in Chile principally in the southern cone winter season (June to August) and during the remainder of the year precipitation is scarce. When rain is abundant, energy produced by hydroelectric plants can amount to more than 70% of total generation. In 2014 hydroelectric generation represented 45% of total energy production.Regulatory FrameworkElectricity Regulation. The government entity that has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system is the Ministry of Energy, acting directly or through the CNE and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. The electricity sector is divided into three segments: generation, transmission and distribution. In general terms, generation and transmission expansion are subject to market competition, while transmission operation and distribution, are subject to price regulation. The transmission segment consists of companies that transmit the electricity produced by generation companies at high voltage. Companies that are owners of a trunk transmission system cannot participate in the generation or distribution segments. Companies in the SIC and the SING that possess generation, transmission, sub-transmission or additional transmission facilities, as well as unregulated customers directly connected to transmission facilities, are coordinated through the CDEC, which minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while meeting all service quality and reliability requirements. The principal purpose of the CDEC is to ensure that the most efficient electricity generation available to meet demand is dispatched to customers. The CDEC dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production which allows for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost.All generators can commercialize energy through contracts with distribution companies for their regulated and unregulated customers or directly with unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase 100% of their electricity requirements under contract. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis. Power generation companies may engage in contracted sales among themselves at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile, under contract and on the spot market, are denominated in U.S. Dollars, although payments are made in Chilean Pesos.Other Regulatory Considerations. In 2011, a regulation on air emission standards for thermoelectric power plants became effective. This regulation provides for stringent limits on emission of PM and gases produced by the combustion of solid and liquid fuels, particularly coal. For existing plants, including those currently under construction, the new limits for PM emissions went into effect at the end of 2013, and the new limits for SO2, NOx and mercury emission will begin to apply in mid-2016, except for those plants operating in zones declared saturated or latent zones (areas at risk of or affected by excessive air pollution), where these emission limits will become effective by June 2015. In order to comply with the new emission standards, AES Gener initiated investments in Chile at its older coal facilities (Ventanas I and II and Norgener I and II, constructed between 1964 and 1997) in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, AES Gener has invested approximately $204 million and expects the remaining $48 million will be invested in 2015 in order to comply within the required time frame. Additionally, its equity method investee Guacolda started the installation of new equipment during 2013, as of December 31, 2014 spending approximately $114 million (Guacolda I, II and IV) and the remaining $107 million will be invested between 2015 and 2016. Chilean law requires every electricity generator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations with NCREs. In October 2013, the NCRE law was amended, increasing the NCRE requirements. The law distinguishes between energy contracts executed before and after July 1, 2013. For contracts executed between August 31, 2007 and July 1, 2013, the NCRE requirement is equal to 5% in 2014 with annual contract increases of 0.5% until reaching 10% in 2024. The NCRE requirement for contracts executed after July 1, 2013 is equal to 6% in 2013, with annual increases of 1% thereafter until 23reaching 12% in 2020, and subsequently annual increases of 1.5% until it is equal to 20% in 2025. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by developing their own NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric technology), purchasing NCREs from qualified generators or by paying the applicable fines for non-compliance. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Gener’s own biomass power plants and by purchasing NCREs from other generation companies. It has sold certain water rights to companies that are developing small hydro projects, entering into power purchase agreements with these companies in order to promote development of these projects, while at the same time meeting the NCRE requirements. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet the future requirements. In September 2014 a new tax law was enacted. The new law introduces an emission tax, or “green tax”, that assesses the emissions of particulate material (PM), SO2, NOx and CO2 produced for installations with an installed capacity over 50 MW. This new tax will be in force from 2017. In the case of CO2, the tax will be equivalent to $5 per ton of CO2 emitted. AES Gener is currently assessing the impacts of the new tax and possible mitigation strategies. Key Financial Drivers Hedge levels at Gener provide some certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers through 2016. However, some risks remain through 2016, including, but not limited to, the following: •Availability of hydro generation: dry hydrology scenarios reduce hydro generation•Availability of generation: forced outages may impact earnings•Regulatory rulings: a change in current governmental rulings could alter the ability to pass through or recover certain costs•Foreign exchange: AES is exposed to the fluctuation of the Chilean peso, which may pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk to earnings remainsBeyond 2016, financial drivers include all of the above factors, but also:•Generation margins: current legislation is trending towards rewarding renewable energy and penalizing coal assets, posing a risk to future coal marginsConstruction and DevelopmentSince 2007, AES Gener has constructed and initiated commercial operations of approximately 1,700 MW of new capacity, representing a significant portion of the increase in installed capacity and investment in the SIC and SING during the period. In Chile, AES Gener has a 21 MW solar project with a scheduled COD in the second half of 2015, two coal-fired projects under construction with gross capacity of 684 MW, 152 MW of which is represented by Guacolda V in the northern part of the SIC, scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2015 and the 532 MW Cochrane project in the SING, expected to begin operations in 2016. The Cochrane project includes a 40 MW energy storage project, which is also scheduled to initiate operations in 2016. Additionally, in the SIC, AES Gener initiated construction of the 531 MW two unit Alto Maipo run-of-river hydroelectric project in December 2013, adjacent to our existing Alfalfal power plant. Alto Maipo is the largest permitted project in the SIC market and includes 67 kilometers of tunnel work as part of the construction. This project is scheduled to start operations in 2018 and is expected to represent approximately 4% of the energy demand in the SIC at that time.ColombiaBusiness Description. As of December 31, 2014, AES Gener’s net power production in Colombia was 3,985 GWh (6% of the country’s total generation). Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, owns a hydroelectric facility with installed capacity of 1,000 MW, located approximately 160 km east of Bogota. The installed capacity represents approximately 6.4% of system capacity as of December 31, 2014. The plant consists of eight 125 MW dam-based hydroelectric generating units in two separate sub-facilities. All of Chivor’s installed capacity in Colombia is hydroelectric and is therefore dependent on the prevailing hydrological conditions in the region in which it operates. Hydrological conditions largely influence generation and the spot prices at which Chivor sells its non-contracted generation in Colombia.Chivor’s commercial strategy focuses on selling between 75% and 85% of the annual expected output under contracts, principally with distribution companies, in order to provide cash flow stability. These bilateral contracts with distribution companies are awarded in public bids and normally last from one to three years. The remaining generation is sold on the spot market to other generation and trading companies at the system marginal cost, allowing us to maximize the operating margin.Additionally, Chivor receives reliability payments for the availability and reliability of Chivor’s reservoir during periods of scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions. These payments, referred to as “reliability charge payments” are designed to compensate generation companies for the firm energy that they are capable of providing to the system during critical periods of low supply in order to prevent electricity shortages.24Market Structure. Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN. The SIN encompasses one-third of Colombia’s territory, providing coverage to 96% of the country’s population. The SIN’s installed capacity totaled 15,528 MW as of December 31, 2014, comprised of 69.3% hydroelectric generation, 29.8% thermoelectric generation and 0.9% other. The dominance of hydroelectric generation and the marked seasonal variations in Colombia’s hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2014, 70.7% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants with the remaining supply from thermoelectric generation (28.6%) and cogeneration and self-generation power (0.7%). From 2003 to 2014, electricity demand in the SIN has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 3% and the UPME projects an average compound annual growth rate in electricity demand of 2.3% per year for the next ten years.Regulatory FrameworkElectricity Regulation. Since 1994, the electricity sector in Colombia has operated under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by various laws and the regulations and technical standards issued by the CREG. Other government entities that play an important role in the electricity industry include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government’s policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing and inspecting the utility companies; and the UPME, which is in charge of planning the expansion of the generation and transmission network. The generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. Generation companies must submit price bids and report the quantity of energy available on a daily basis. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units.Other Regulatory Considerations. In the past few years, Colombian authorities have discussed proposals to make certain regulatory changes, which have not been implemented as of February 2015. One proposal is to replace or complement the current public auction system in which each distribution company holds an auction for its specific requirements and subsequently executes bilateral contracts with generation or trading companies, with a centralized auction in which the market administrator purchases energy for all distribution companies. During 2015, regulators must develop rules to implement Law 1715 passed in 2014 regarding the participation of renewables sources in the electric sector and the rules for negotiation of excess of energy from self-generators. Additionally, regulation for emergency energy situations, such as severe drought conditions, was introduced in 2014 with the objective of avoiding shortages and other negative economic impacts.Key Financial DriversHedge levels at Chivor provide a high degree of certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers through 2016, however, some risks remain beyond 2016.Through 2016, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following: •Availability of generation: forced outages may impact earnings•Availability of hydro generation: dry hydrology scenarios reduce hydro generation•Foreign exchange: AES is exposed to fluctuation of the Colombian peso, which pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk to earnings remainsBeyond 2016, financial drivers include all of the above factors, but also:•Spot market exposure: Chivor has exposure to the spot market as hedge levels are lower in the futureHydrological conditions largely influence Chivor’s generation level. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while working to maximize revenue, through sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor’s results of operations.Construction and Development In Colombia, AES Gener is currently constructing the 20 MW Tunjita run-of-river hydroelectric project, which is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2015.ArgentinaBusiness Description. As of December 31, 2014, AES Argentina operates 3,508 MW which represents 11% of the country’s total installed capacity. The installed capacity in the SADI includes the TermoAndes plant, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which is connected both to the SADI and the Chilean SING. AES Argentina has a diversified generation portfolio of ten generation facilities, comprised of 61% thermoelectric and 39% hydroelectric capacity. All of the thermoelectric capacity has the capability to burn alternative fuels. Approximately 69% of the thermoelectric capacity can operate alternatively with natural gas or diesel oil, and the remaining 31% can operate alternatively with natural gas or fuel oil.25AES Argentina primarily sells its production to the wholesale electric market where prices are largely regulated. In 2014, approximately 93% of the energy was sold in the wholesale electric market and 7% was sold under contract, as a result of the Energy Plus sales made by TermoAndes. Market prices are determined in Argentine Pesos by the CAMMESA.All of the thermoelectric facilities not affected by the Resolution 95/2013, including TermoAndes, are able to use natural gas and receive gas supplied through contracts with Argentine producers. In recent years, gas supply restrictions in Argentina, particularly during the winter season, have affected some of the plants, such as the TermoAndes plant which is connected to the SING by a transmission line owned by AES Gener. The TermoAndes plant commenced operations in 2000, selling exclusively into the Chilean SING. In 2008, following requirements from the Argentine authorities, TermoAndes connected its two gas turbines to the SADI, while maintaining its steam turbine connected to the SING. However, since mid-December 2011, TermoAndes has been selling the plant’s full capacity in the SADI. TermoAndes’ electricity permit to export to the SING expired on January 31, 2013 and its potential renewal is being evaluated.Market Structure. The SADI electricity market is managed by CAMMESA. As of December 31, 2014, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 32,371 MW. In 2014, 63% of total energy demand was supplied by thermoelectric plants, 31% by hydroelectric plants and 6% from nuclear, wind and solar plants.Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is principally fueled by natural gas. However, since 2004 due to natural gas shortages, in addition to increasing electricity demand, the use of alternative fuels in thermoelectric generation, such as oil and coal, has increased. Given the importance of hydroelectric facilities in the SADI, hydrological conditions determining river flow volumes and initial water levels in reservoirs largely influence hydroelectric and thermoelectric plant dispatch. Rainfall occurs principally in the southern cone winter season (June to August).Regulatory FrameworkElectricity Regulation. The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission and distribution. The wholesale electric market is made up of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who are allowed to buy and sell electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the short-term market or to customers in the contract market. CAMMESA, the wholesale electric market administrator, is responsible for dispatch coordination and determination of short-term prices. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, through the Energy Secretariat, regulates system dispatch and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. Since 2001, significant modifications have also been made to the electricity regulatory framework. These modifications include tariff conversion to Argentinean Pesos, freezing of tariffs, the cancellation of inflation adjustment mechanisms and the introduction of a complex pricing system in the wholesale electric market, which have materially affected electricity generators, transporters and distributors, and generated substantial price differences within the market. Since 2004, as a result of energy market reforms and overdue accounts receivables owed by the government to generators operating in Argentina, AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivables to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plants begin operations. At this point, three funds have been created to construct three facilities. The first two plants are operating and payments are being received, while the third plant is under construction. AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in these newly built plants once the accounts receivables have been paid. See Item 7. Capital Resources and Liquidity—Long-Term Receivables and Note 7—Financing Receivables for further discussion of receivables in Argentina.On March 26, 2013, the Secretariat of Energy released Resolution 95/2013, which affects the remuneration of generators whose sales prices had been frozen since 2003. This new regulation, which modified the current regulatory framework for the electricity industry, is applicable to generation companies with certain exceptions. It defined a new compensation system based on compensating for fixed costs, non-fuel variable costs and an additional margin. Resolution 95/2013 converted the Argentine electric market towards an "average cost" compensation scheme, increasing revenues of generators that were not selling their production under the Energy Plus scheme or under energy supply contracts with CAMMESA. Resolution 95/2013 applies to all of AES Argentina’s plants, excluding TermoAndes. Based on Note 2053 sent by the Ministry of Energy in March 2013, it is understood that TermoAndes’ units are not affected by the Resolution since they sell under the Energy Plus scheme.Thermal units must achieve an availability target which varies by technology in order to receive full fixed cost revenues. The availability of most of AES Argentina’s units exceeds this market average. As a result of Resolution 95/2013, revenues to AES Argentina’s thermal units increased, but the impact on hydroelectric units is dependent on hydrology. The new Resolution also established that all fuels, except coal, are to be provided by CAMMESA. Thermoelectric natural gas plants not affected by the Resolution, such as TermoAndes, are able to purchase gas directly from the producers for Energy Plus sales.On May 20, 2014, the Argentine government passed Resolution No. 529/214 (“Resolution 529”) which retroactively updated the prices of Resolution 95/2013 to February 1, 2014, changed target availability and added a remuneration for non-26periodic maintenance. This renumeration is aimed to cover the expenses that the generator incurs when performing major maintenances in its units. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Argentine government passed a resolution to contribute outstanding Resolution 95 receivables into a trust in connection with AES Argentina’s commitment to install 90 MW of capacity into the system. CAMMESA will finance the investment utilizing the outstanding receivables as a guarantee.Key Financial DriversFinancial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following: •Availability of generation - forced outages may impact earnings•Exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso•Hydrology•Lack of subsequent regulatory adjustments for cost increases •Timely collection of FONINVEMEM installment and outstanding receivables•Level of gas prices for contracted generation (Energy Plus)•Access to foreign exchange for importsSee Item 7.—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Argentina for further discussion of Argentina.Brazil SBUOur Brazil SBU has generation and distribution businesses. Our Brazil operations accounted for 24%, 27% and 27% of consolidated AES Operating Margin and 13%, 12% and 16% of consolidated AES Adjusted PTC (a non-GAAP measure) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The percentages reflect the contribution by our Brazil SBU to gross operating margin and Adjusted PTC before deductions for Corporate.Eletropaulo and Tietê are publicly listed companies in Brazil. AES has a 16% economic interest in Eletropaulo and a 24% economic interest in Tietê, and these businesses are consolidated in our financial statements as we maintain control over their operations.

AES owns interests in two distribution businesses in Brazil, Eletropaulo and Sul. Eletropaulo operates in the metropolitan area of São Paulo and adjacent regions, distributing electricity to 24 municipalities in a total area of 4,526 km2, covering a region of high demographic density and the largest concentration of GDP in the country. Serving approximately 20.1 million people and 6.7 million consumer units, Eletropaulo is the largest power distributor in Brazil, according to the 2012 ranking of the Brazilian Association of the Distributors of Electric Energy (Abradee).Sul is responsible for supplying electricity to 118 municipalities of the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre on the border with Uruguay and Argentina. The service area covers 99,512 km2, serving approximately 3.5 million people and 1.3 million consumer units.Set forth in the table below is a list of our Brazil SBU distribution facilities:Business Location Approximate Number of Customers Served as of 12/31/2014 GWh Sold in 2014 AES Equity Interest (% Rounded) Year AcquiredEletropaulo Brazil 6,682,000 47,583 16% 1998Sul Brazil 1,270,000 9,691 100% 1997    7,952,000 57,274    The following map illustrates the location of our Brazil facilities:Brazil Generation BusinessesBusiness Description. Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power plants with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW in the State of São Paulo. Tietê was privatized in 1999 under a 30-year concession expiring in 2029. AES owns a 24% economic interest in Tietê, our partner, the BNDES, owns 28% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held by government-related entities. AES is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business.Tietê sells nearly 100% of its assured capacity, approximately 11,108 GWh, to Eletropaulo under a long-term PPA, which is expiring in December 2015. The contract is price-adjusted annually for inflation, and as of December 31, 2014, the price was R$206/MWh. After the expiration of contract with Eletropaulo, Tietê’s strategy is to contract most of its Assured Energy, as described in Regulatory Framework section below, in the free market and sell the remaining portion in the spot market. Tietê’s strategy is reassessed from time to time according to changes in market conditions, hydrology and other factors. Tietê has been continuously selling its available energy from 2016 forward through medium-term bilateral contracts (3-5 years). As of December 31, 2014, Tietê's contracted portfolio position is 83% and 73% with average prices of R$132/MWh and R$133/MWh for 2016 and 2017, respectively. As Brazil is mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to the hydrological situation, the deterioration of the hydrology in 2014 caused an increase in energy prices going forward. Tietê is closely monitoring and analyzing system supply conditions to support energy commercialization decisions. In 2014, 31 new contracts were signed at an average price of approximately R$147/MWh. Tietê's current view on energy prices for 2016 is in 28the range of R$245 - R$265/MWh, prior to adjustment for inflation, depending on the length of the contract (vs. R$125-R$135/MWh expectation in the beginning of 2014). Tietê’s strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee in the free market while the remaining portion provides flexibility to either protect against eventual Assured Energy reduction or potentially capture higher spot prices in the future. As Brazil does not have a developed market with hedge and options instruments for the energy sector, Tietê does not assume any hedging strategy for its portfolio. Future prices could vary materially, depending on the supply and demand for electricity, hydrology and other market conditions. Under the concession agreement, Tietê has an obligation to increase its capacity by 15%. Tietê as well as other concessionaire generators have not yet met this requirement due to regulatory, environmental, hydrological and fuel constraints. A legal case has been initiated by the State of São Paulo requiring the investment to be performed. Tietê is in the process of analyzing options to meet the obligation.Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, commissioned in December 2000. AES manages and has a 46% economic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by BNDES. The plant's operations were suspended in April 2009 due to the unavailability of gas. AES has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a competitive basis to Uruguaiana. One of the challenges is the capacity restrictions on the Argentinean pipeline, especially during the winter season when gas demand in Argentina is very high. The plant operated on a short-term basis in 2013 (February and March) and 2014 (March, April, and May) due to the short-term supply of LNG for the facility. Uruguaiana continues to work towards securing gas on a long-term basis.Market Structure. Brazil has installed capacity of 123,973 MW, which is 74% hydroelectric, 16% thermal and 10% renewable (biomass and wind). Brazil's national grid is divided into four subsystems. Tietê sells into the Southeast subsystem of the national grid, while Uruguaiana sells into the South.Regulatory FrameworkIn Brazil, the MME determines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell, called “Assured Energy”, which represents the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, a generation plant's Assured Energy can be sold to distribution companies through long-term (regulated) auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies. The ONS is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operation of the national grid. The ONS dispatches generators based on hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation. Given the importance of hydro generation in the country, the ONS sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to protect reservoir levels in the system. Hydrological risk is shared among hydroelectric generation plants through the MRE. If the hydro system generates less than total Assured Energy of the system, hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market to fulfill their contract obligations. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE Assured Energy, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants as well and they are able to make extra revenues selling the excess energy on the spot market.Due to lower than expected hydrology during 2014, from February to April the spot price was at the cap of R$822/MWh and the average spot price of 2014 was R$690/MWh. During October and November 2014, the ANEEL conducted a public hearing to define a new spot price cap, changing it from R$822/MWh to R$388/MWh from January 2015 forward. The lower cap price will result in a meaningful reduction on the expenses of the agents that are negatively exposed to the spot price in 2015. AES’ expectation for 2015 is that spot prices will be near the new regulatory cap of R$388/MWh and hydro power generators may purchase energy due to lower Assured Energy in the system as a result of unfavorable hydrological conditions. See Item 7. Key Trends and Uncertainties- Operational - Weather Sensitivity for further information.Key Financial Drivers As the system is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, Tietê and Uruguaiana are affected by the hydrology in the overall sector, as well as the availability of Tietê’s plants and reliability of the Uruguaiana facility. The availability of gas for continued operations is a driver for Uruguaiana.Through and beyond 2016, Tietê's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy sold•Re-contracting price•Asset management and plant availability•Cost management29•Ability to execute on its growth strategyThrough and beyond 2016, Uruguaiana financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•Arbitration settlement with YPF (see Item 3.—Legal Proceedings)•Secure long-term gas solutionBrazil Utility BusinessesBusiness Description. Eletropaulo distributes electricity to the Greater São Paulo area, Brazil’s main economic and financial center. Eletropaulo is the largest electric power distributor in Latin America in terms of both revenues and volume of energy distribution. AES owns a 16% of the economic interest in Eletropaulo, our partner, BNDES, owns 19% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held by government-related entities. AES is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business. Eletropaulo holds a 30-year concession that expires in 2028.AES owns 100% of Sul. Sul distributes electricity in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre up to the frontier with Uruguay and Argentina, respectively, in the municipalities of Santana do Livramento and Uruguaiana/São Borja at the extreme west of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. AES manages Sul under a 30-year concession expiring in 2027.Regulatory FrameworkIn Brazil, the ANEEL, a government agency, sets the tariff for each distribution company based on a Return on Asset Base methodology, which also benchmarks operational costs against other distribution companies.The tariff charged to regulated customers consists of two elements: (i) pass-through of non-manageable costs under a determined methodology (“Parcel A”), including energy purchase costs, sector charges and transmission and distribution system expenses; and (ii) a manageable cost component (“Parcel B”), including operation and maintenance costs (defined by ANEEL), recovery of investments and a component for a return to the distributor. The return to distributors is calculated as the net asset base multiplied by the regulatory weighted-average cost of capital ("Regulatory WACC"), which is set for all industry participants during each tariff reset cycle. The current Regulatory WACC, after tax, is 7.5%. For the next tariff cycle which will be applied in July 2015 at Eletropaulo, the Regulatory WACC, after tax, will be 8.1%. This WACC will be updated again in three years before the next tariff review at Sul in April 2018.Each year ANEEL reviews each distributor's tariff for an annual tariff adjustment. The annual tariff adjustments allow for pass-through of Parcel A costs and inflation impacts on Parcel B costs, adjusted for expected efficiency gains and quality performances. Distribution companies are required to contract between 100% and 105% of anticipated energy needs through the regulated auction market. If contracted levels fall below required levels distribution companies may be subject to limitations on the pass-through treatment of energy purchase costs as well as penalties.Every four to five years, ANEEL resets each distributor's tariff to incorporate the revised Regulatory WACC and determination of the distributor's net asset base. Eletropaulo’s tariff reset occurs every four years and the next tariff reset will be in July 2015. Sul’s tariff is reset every five years and the next tariff reset is expected in April 2018.ANEEL has challenged the parameters of a tariff reset for Eletropaulo implemented in July 2012 and retroactive to 2011. ANEEL has asserted that during the period between 2007 and 2011, certain assets that were included in the regulatory asset base should not have been included and that Eletropaulo should refund customers for the return on the disputed assets earned during this period. On December 17, 2013, ANEEL determined, at the administrative level, that Eletropaulo should adjust the prior (2007-2011) regulatory asset base and refund customers in the amount of $269 million over a period of up to four tariff processes beginning in July 2014. Eletropaulo filed for an administrative appeal requesting ANEEL to reconsider its decision and requested that the decision be suspended until the appeal process was completed. On January 28, 2014, ANEEL denied Eletropaulo’s request to suspend the effects of the previous decision. On January 29, 2014, Eletropaulo requested and received from the Federal Court of Brazil an injunction for the suspension of the effects of ANEEL’s previous decision. As ANEEL had confirmed the original decision and the related refund to customers, the injunction no longer became effective. The Company recognized a regulatory liability of approximately $269 million in the Company’s 2013 fourth quarter results of operations since ANEEL had compelled the Company to refund customers. Eletropaulo started reimbursing customers in July 2014. On December 18, 2014, the effects of the injunction were restored and on January 5, 2015, during a public hearing, ANEEL resolved to follow the legal decision. However, on January 7, 2015 ANEEL requested the suspension of the injunction. While the final legal decision has yet not been taken, ANEEL released a new tariff for Eletropaulo on January 8, 2015, not considering the reimbursement to customers, which is immediately effective.30Key Financial DriversThrough and beyond 2016, Eletropaulo and Sul financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following: •Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy sold and energy purchased•Brazilian economic growth and tariff increases, impacting energy consumption growth, losses and delinquency•Eletropaulo's Fourth tariff cycle outcomes in July 2015•Ability of both Eletropaulo and Sul to pass through costs via productivity gains•Capital structure optimization to reduce leverage and interest costs•Sul's Fourth tariff cycle outcomes in April 2018•July 2012 regulatory asset base resolution•The Eletrobrás case (see Item 3.—Legal Proceedings).Eletropaulo and Sul are affected by the demand for electricity, which is driven by economic activity, weather patterns and customers’ consumption behavior. Operating performance is also driven by the quality of service, efficient management of operating and maintenance costs as well as the ability to control non-technical losses. Finally, annual tariff adjustments and periodic tariff resets by ANEEL impact results from operations. In addition, Eletropaulo is involved in a dispute with Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A. (“Eletrobrás”) regarding a liability from the privatization of Eletropaulo. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings for further discussion of this dispute. If Eletropaulo is found liable in the dispute, Eletropaulo's results from operations could be materially affected.MCAC SBUOur MCAC SBU has a portfolio of distribution businesses and generation facilities, including renewable energy, in five countries, with a total capacity of 3,140 MW and distribution networks serving 1.3 million customers as of December 31, 2014.

AES Dominicana consists of three operating subsidiaries, Itabo, Andres and DPP. AES has 23% of the system capacity (850 MW) and supplies approximately 40% of energy demand through these generation facilities.During 2014, AES entered into a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups (“Estrella-Linda”), an investor group based in the Dominican Republic. Under this agreement, Estrella-Linda acquired an 8% non-controlling interest in AES’ business in the Dominican Republic for $84 million with an option to increase up to 20% by the end of 2016. Estrella-Linda is a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groups: Estrella and Grupo Linda. The two partners manage a diversified business portfolio, including construction services, cement, agribusiness, metalwork, plastics, textiles, paints, transportation, insurance and media.Itabo is 46%-owned by AES, 4% by Estrella-Linda, 49.97% owned by FONPER, a government-owned utility and the remaining 0.03% is owned by employees. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power generation units with a total of 295 MWs of installed capacity. Itabo's PPAs are with government-owned distribution companies and expire in 2016. Andres and DPP are owned 92% by AES and 8% by Estrella-Linda. Andres has a combined cycle gas turbine and generation capacity of 319 MW as well as the only LNG import facility in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. DPP (Los Mina) has two open cycle natural gas turbines and generation capacity of 236 MW. Both Andres and DPP have in aggregate 555 MW of installed capacity, of which 450 MW is mostly contracted until 2018 with government-owned distribution companies and large customers. AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. This translates into a competitive advantage as we are currently purchasing LNG at prices lower than those on the international market. The LNG contract terms allow the diversion of the cargoes to various markets in Latin America. These plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel oil-based generation. In 2005, Andres entered into a contract to sell re-gasified LNG for further distribution to industrial users within the Dominican Republic using compression technology to transport it within the country. In January 2010, the first LNG truck tanker loading terminal started operations. With this investment, AES is capturing demand from industrial and commercial customers.Since the majority of distribution companies’ long term PPAs are expiring in July 2016, the CDEEE is sponsoring a bidding process that is expected to be released and awarded during 2015 in order to secure supply and competitive pricing for actual and future distribution energy requirements. The existing business strategy is to secure approximately 70% to 80% of the open position through new PPAs with distribution companies and large users. Price and PPA structure will be subject to the terms of the bidding process.33Market StructureElectricity Market. The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with approximately 3,700 MW of installed capacity, composed primarily of thermal generation (85%) and hydroelectric power plants (15%).Natural Gas Market. The natural gas market in the Dominican Republic started developing in 2001 when AES entered into a long-term contract for LNG and constructed AES Dominicana’s LNG regasification terminal.Regulatory FrameworkThe regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic consists of a decentralized industry including generation, transmission and distribution, where generation companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services and a competitive wholesale generation market. All electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the GEL.Two main agencies are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the GEL, the CNE and the SIE. CNE is in charge of drafting and coordinating the legal framework and regulatory legislation, proposing and adopting policies and procedures to assure best practices, drafting plans to ensure the proper functioning and development of the energy sector and promoting investment. SIE's main responsibilities include monitoring and supervising compliance with legal provisions and rules, monitoring compliance with the technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity and supervising electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices.The electricity tariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Clients with demand above 1.0 MW are classified as unregulated customers and their tariffs are unregulated.Fuels and hydrocarbons are regulated by a specific law which establishes prices to end customers and a tax on consumption of fossil fuels. For natural gas there are regulations related to the procedures to be followed to grant licenses and concessions: i) distribution, including transportation and loading and compression plant; ii) the installation and operation of natural gas stations, including consumers and potential modifications of existing facilities; and iii) conversion equipment suppliers for vehicles. The regulation is administered by the ICM who supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to the end users.Key Financial DriversFinancial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following: •Spot prices are mainly driven by the fluctuations in commodity prices due to the dependency of the Dominican Republic on oil-based thermal generation. Since the fuel component is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in the oil prices will mainly impact the spot sales for both Andres and Itabo, which are expected to be net sellers in the upcoming years. Current contracting level for 2015 is close to 80%. Supply shortages in the near term (next 2 to 3 years) may provide opportunities for upside but new generation is expected to come online from 2018.•New market rules for ancillary services enacted in 2014, particularly with regard to primary frequency regulation, reduced the revenues in the latter part of the 2014 and may impact future earnings •Additional sales derived from natural gas domestic demand are expected to continue providing an income stream and growth based on the entry of future projects and the fees from the infrastructure service.In addition, the financial weakness of the three state-owned distribution companies due to low collection rates and high levels of non-technical losses has led to delays in payments for the electricity supplied by generators. At times when outstanding receivable balances have accumulated, AES Dominicana has accepted payment through other means, such as government bonds, in order to reduce the balance. There can be no guarantee that alternative collection methodologies will always be an avenue available for payment options. Construction and Development. DPP is converting its existing plant from open cycle to combined cycle. The project will recycle DPP’s heat emissions and increase total power output by approximately 122 MW of gross capacity at an estimated cost of $275 million, fully financed with non-recourse debt. The EPC contract was signed on July 2, 2014, and the additional capacity is expected to become operational in the first quarter of 2017. Based on the increased capacity, AES Dominicana executed a PPA for 270 MW for a 6.5 years term beginning on August 1, 2016.PanamaBusiness Description. AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants representing 705 MWs of installed capacity, or 26% of the installed capacity in Panama. The majority of our capacity in Panama is run-of-river, with the exception of the 260 MW Bayano project. 34A portion of the distribution companies' PPAs will expire on December 2018 reducing the total contract capacity of the company from 424 MW to 350 MW and will remain at that level until December 2030.Market Structure. Panama’s current total installed capacity is 2,759 MW, of which 56% is hydroelectric, 2% wind and the remaining 42% thermal generation from diesel, bunker fuel and coal.The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission, all of which are governed by Electric Law 6 enacted in 1997. Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each other. Outside of the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. The CND implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The CND's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system, taking into account the price of water, which determines the dispatch of hydro plants with reservoirs. Short-term power prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit.In Panama, dry hydrological conditions in 2014 reduced generation output from hydroelectric facilities and increased spot prices for electricity. From March to June 2014, the government of Panama implemented certain energy saving measures designed to reduce demand for electricity during peak hours by approximately 300 MW, which contributed to water savings in the key hydroelectric dams and lower spot prices. AES Panama had to purchase energy on the spot market to fulfill its contract obligations as its generation output was below contract levels. On March 31, 2014, the government of Panama agreed to reduce the financial impact of spot electricity purchases and transmission constraints equivalent to a 70 MW reduction in contracted capacity for the period 2014-2016 by compensating AES Panama for spot purchases up to $40 million in 2014, $30 million in 2015 and $30 million in 2016.Regulatory Framework. The SNE has the responsibilities of planning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that promote the procurement of electrical energy, hydrocarbons and alternative energy for the country.The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight of public services including electricity and the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such services.Generators can only contract their firm capacity. Physical generation of energy is determined by the CND regardless of contractual arrangements.Key Financial Drivers Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following: •Lower hydrology resulting in low generation and high spot prices for the additional energy purchased to fulfill contracts, partially mitigated by the compensation agreement with the government and the power barge which is expected to be operational in the first half of 2015•Constraints imposed by the capacity of the transmission line connecting the west side of the country with the load center are expected to continue until the end of 2016 keeping surplus power trapped, particularly during the wet season•Country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term•Spot prices are driven by hydrology since Panama is highly dependent on hydro generation (~56%), however, fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil prices, will affect the thermal generation cost impacting the spot prices and the opportunity cost of waterGiven that most of AES' portfolio is run-of-river, hydrological conditions have an important influence on its profitability. Variations in actual hydrology can result in excess or a short energy balance relative to our contract obligations. During the low inflow period (January to May), generation tends to be lower and AES Panama may purchase energy in the short-term market to cover contractual obligations. During the remainder of the year (June to December), generation tends to be higher and energy generated in excess of contract volumes is sold to the short-term market. In addition to hydrological conditions, commodity prices affect short-term electricity prices. See Item 7. Key Trends and Uncertainties- Operational - Weather Sensitivity for further information.Construction and Development.Following the strategy to reduce reliance on hydrology, in September 2014 AES Panama acquired a a 72 MW gross capacity power barge for $27 million, financed with non-recourse debt. The barge arrived in Panama on September 25, 2014 35and is expected to become operational in the first half of 2015 with fuel to be supplied by Chevron. AES Panama executed a physical PPA for the supply of energy for a period of 5 years.MexicoBusiness Description. AES has 1,055 MW of installed capacity in Mexico, including the 550 MW Termoeléctrica del Golfo (“TEG”) and Termoeléctrica Peñoles (“TEP”) facilities and Merida III (“Merida”), a 505 MW generation facility. The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired plants, located in San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 with a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract. Merida is a CCGT, located in Merida, on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity and energy based long-term PPA through 2025. Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a long-term contract, the cost of which is then passed through to CFE under the terms of the PPA.Market Structure. Mexico has a single national electricity grid, the SEN, covering nearly all of Mexico’s territory. Mexico has an installed capacity totaling 54 GW with a generation mix of 74% thermal, 21% hydroelectric and 5% other. Electricity consumption is split between the following end users: industrial (58%), residential (26%) and commercial and service (16%).Regulatory Framework The CFE, mandated by the Mexican Constitution, is the state-owned electric monopoly that operates the national grid and generates electricity for the public. CFE regulates wholesale tariffs which are largely set by the marginal production cost of oil and gas-fired generation. The Mexican energy system is fully integrated under the sole responsibility of CFE. The Electric Public Service Law allows privately owned projects to produce electricity for self-supply application and/or IPP structures.Under current regulatory framework, private parties are allowed to invest in certain activities in Mexico’s electric power market and obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for: (i) generating power for self-supply; (ii) generating power through co-generation processes; (iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small-scale production; and (v) importing and exporting electrical power. Permit holders are required to enter into PPAs with the CFE to sell all surplus power produced. Merida provides power exclusively to CFE under a long-term contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long-term contracts and can sell any excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day-ahead price.During 2014, the Mexican government promulgated the administrative regulations for the implementation of a new regulatory framework including the following aspects:•Electricity Reform: implementing a complete restructuring of the industry including permitting process, terms and conditions for transmission and distribution services and a wholesale electricity market, among others. Under the proposed reform, the CFE will be transformed into a Productive State Enterprise, including separation of the vertically-integrated monopoly into generation, transmission, distribution and marketing activities. •Regulations to the Geothermal Energy Law: setting forth details on terms and conditions of the permitting process and of the exploitation of the resources.Key Financial DriversOperational performance is the key business driver as the companies are fully contracted and better performance provides additional financial benefits including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales (in the case of TEG/TEP). The energy prices of TEG/TEP for the sales in excess over its long-term contracts are driven by the average production cost of CFE which is highly dependent on natural gas and oil. If the average production cost of CFE is higher than the cost of generating with pet coke, our businesses in Mexico will benefit provided that they are able to sell energy in excess of their PPAs.Other MCAC BusinessesPuerto RicoBusiness Description. AES Puerto Rico is a 524 MW coal-fired cogeneration plant utilizing CFB technology, representing approximately 9% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. The plant has a long-term PPA expiring in 2027 with the PREPA, a state-owned entity that supplies virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. See Item 7. Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long-term PPA with PREPA.El SalvadorBusiness Description. AES is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador. The distribution companies are operated by AES on an integrated basis under a single management team. AES El Salvador’s 36territory covers 84% of the country. AES El Salvador accounted for 3,796 GWh of market energy purchases during 2014, or about 63% market share of the country’s total energy purchases.The sector is governed by the General Electricity Law and the general and specific orders issued by Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicacions (“SIGET” or “The Regulator”). The Regulator, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, completed the tariff reset process in December 2012 and defined the tariff calculation to be applicable for the next five years (2013-2017).Europe SBU Our Europe SBU has generation facilities in five countries. Our European operations accounted for 13%, 13% and 14% of AES consolidated Operating Margin and 19%, 19% and 18% of AES consolidated Adjusted PTC (a non-GAAP measure) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The percentages reflect the contribution by our Europe SBU to gross Operating Margin and Adjusted PTC before deductions for Corporate.The following table provides highlights of our Europe operations:Countries Bulgaria, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Netherlands and United KingdomGeneration Capacity 6,699 gross MW (4,989 proportional MW)Generation Facilities 11Key Generation Businesses Maritza, Kilroot, Ballylumford, and KazakhstanOperating installed capacity of our Europe SBU totaled 6,699 MW.

Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel plant that was commissioned in June 2011. Maritza is the only coal-fired power plant in Bulgaria that is fully compliant with the EU Industrial Emission Directive, which comes into force in 2016. Maritza’s entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in 2026, capacity and energy based, with a fuel pass-though. The lignite and limestone are supplied under a 15-year fuel supply contract. AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March 2010. Its entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in March 2025.Market Structure. The maximum market capacity in 2014 was approximately 13.6 GW. Thermal generation, which is mostly coal-fired, and nuclear power plants account for 64% of the installed capacity.Regulatory FrameworkThe electricity sector in Bulgaria operates under the Energy Act of 2004 that allows the sale of electricity to take place freely at negotiated prices, at regulated prices between parties or on the organized market. In practice, an organized market for trading electricity has not yet evolved, so NEK remains the main wholesale buyer for power generated in Bulgaria.Our investments in Bulgaria rely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEK is facing some liquidity issues and has been delayed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In May and June 2014, Bulgaria’s State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (SEWRC) issued decisions precluding the ability of NEK to pass-through to the regulated market certain costs incurred by NEK pursuant to the PPA with Maritza, which could further impact NEK's liquidity and its ability to make payments under the PPA. SEWRC also instructed NEK and Maritza to begin negotiating amendments to the PPA, including taking one of Maritza’s units out of the PPA and reducing the price of the remaining unit’s output by 30%. Maritza has filed appeals of these SEWRC decisions with the Supreme Administrative Court in Bulgaria. In November 2014, SEWRC issued a new decision withdrawing the specific PPA amendment conditions and replacing with instructions to start negotiations without conditions. In addition, SEWRC announced that it has asked the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission (DG Comp) to review NEK's respective PPAs with Maritza and a separate generator pursuant to European state aid rules, and to suspend the PPAs pending the completion of that review. DG Comp has not contacted Maritza about the SEWRC's request to date. On July 24, 2014, the Bulgarian government formally resigned and the caretaker government was appointed by the President. Preliminary parliamentary elections were held on October 5, 2014. Eight political parties were elected and the biggest party, supported by another three, formed a coalition government. Meanwhile, the caretaker government requested and received the resignations of the former chairman and two commissioners of the Regulator. The new leadership approved an end-consumer energy price increase of approximately 10% effective October 1, 2014, which is expected to slightly improve NEK's liquidity. At this time, it is difficult to predict the impact of these political conditions and regulatory changes on our businesses in Bulgaria. Maritza has experienced ongoing delays in the collection of outstanding receivables from NEK. In November 2013, Maritza and NEK signed an agreement to reschedule payments of the overdue balance as of the agreement date. By December 382014, NEK has fulfilled its payment obligations under the agreement. On July 31, 2014, Maritza entered into a tripartite agreement with NEK and Mini Maritza Iztok EAD (MMI), our fuel supplier, which reduced Maritza's outstanding receivables from NEK by $17 million through an offset of payables due by Maritza to MMI. Additionally, NEK agreed to four additional monthly installments totaling $28 million to be paid equally from August to November 2014, which NEK made accordingly. As of December 31, 2014, Maritza had an outstanding receivables balance of $262 million including $57 million of current receivables, $75 million of receivables overdue by less than 90 days and $130 million of receivables overdue by more than 90 days. See Key Trends and Uncertainties, Macroeconomics, Bulgaria in Item 7—Management Discussion and Analysis to this Form 10-K for further information.On February 18, 2014, Standard & Poor's lowered NEK's credit rating from BB- to B+ with a negative outlook. This credit rating is lower than the rating NEK had of BB upon the issuance of the Government Support Letter in 2005. Given the credit rating lowered, the PPA could be terminated at the discretion of Maritza and the lenders. Also, as a result of the restructuring, SEWRC revoked NEK's transmission license. These events trigger a cross default under the project debt agreements. See .—Risk Factors—Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations; Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies; and Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1. of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as CFB boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NOX emissions.Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. The Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning new source review and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA.United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and RegulationsIn the United States the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX, PM, GHGs, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.CSAPR. The CSAPR requires significant reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. Once fully implemented, the rule requires SO2 emission reductions of 73%, and NOX reductions of 54%, from 2005 levels. The CSAPR will be implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of new emissions allowances that the EPA will create. The CSAPR contemplates limited interstate and intra-state trading of emissions allowances by covered sources. Initially, the EPA will issue emissions allowances to affected power plants based on state emissions budgets established by the EPA under the CSAPR. The future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time.The EPA has issued an interim final rule establishing the following deadlines for implementation of the CSAPR:•January 1, 2015: Phase 1 (2015 and 2016) begins for annual trading programs. Existing units must begin monitoring and reporting SO2 and NOx emissions.•May 1, 2015: Phase 1 begins for ozone-season NOx trading program. Existing units must begin monitoring and reporting NOx emissions.•December 1, 2015 (and each Dec. 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with ozone-season NOx trading program (i.e., allowance transfer deadline).45•March 1, 2016 (and each March 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with annual trading programs (i.e., allowance transfer deadline).•January 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for annual trading programs. Assurance provisions in effect.•May 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for ozone-season NOx trading program. Assurance provisions in effect. The Company will be required to comply with the CSAPR in several states, including Ohio and Indiana. We cannot predict at this time the impact that implementation of the CSAPR will have on the Company but note that the current, state-wide emissions in the states in which the Company’s subsidiaries operate are below the CSAPR budgets for Phase 1. Nonetheless, in the future certain of the Company’s subsidiaries could be required to increase their capital expenditures and face increasing compliance costs to fully comply with the CSAPR, which expenditures and costs could be material. MATS. The EPA is obligated under Section 112 of the CAA to develop a rule requiring pollution controls for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and nickel species, among other substances, from coal and oil-fired power plants. In connection with such rule, the CAA requires the EPA to establish MACT. MACT is defined as the emission limitation achieved by the “best performing 12%” of sources in the source category. Pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA, the EPA promulgated a final rule on December 16, 2011, called the MATS establishing National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. These emission standards reflect the EPA’s application of MATS for each pollutant regulated under the rule. The rule requires all coal-fired power plants to comply with the applicable MATS standards by April 2015, with the possibility of obtaining a one year extension, if needed, to complete the installation of necessary controls. To comply with the rule, many coal-fired power plants may need to install additional control technology to control acid gases, mercury or PM, or they may need to repower with an alternate fuel or retire operations. Most of the Company’s United States coal-fired plants operated by the Company’s subsidiaries have scrubbers or comparable control technologies designed to remove SO2 and which also remove some acid gases. However, there are other improvements to such control technologies that may be needed even at these plants to assure compliance with the MATS standards. Older coal-fired facilities that do not currently have a SO2 scrubbers installed are particularly at risk. For a discussion of the deactivation and planned deactivation of certain units owned or partially owned by IPL and DP&L as a result of existing and expected environmental regulations, including MATS, see Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation below. IPL estimates additional expenditures related to the MATS rule for environmental controls for its baseload generating units to be approximately $511 million through 2016, excluding demolition costs. In August 2013, the IURC approved IPL’s MATS petition and request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for this amount (including supplemental testimony). These filings detail the installations of new pollution control equipment that IPL plans to add to its five largest baseload generating units. The IURC also approved, with certain stipulations, IPL’s request to recover through its environmental rate adjustment mechanism all operating and capital expenditures (including a return) related to compliance. Recovery of these costs is through an Indiana statute that allows for 100% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism. As part of its Order, the IURC stipulated that if IPL’s Harding Street unit is retired before IPL has fully depreciated the new controls (which have a 20-year depreciable life), IPL shall not continue to collect depreciation expense on the clean energy projects included in the MATS Order for that unit. IPL management is currently evaluating the impact of this recent Order.Several lawsuits challenging the MATS rule were filed and consolidated into a single proceeding before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the "D.C Circuit"). On April 15, 2014, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit denied the challenges. On November 25, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in several petitions for review of the D.C. Circuit’s decision. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to review the case by July 2015. It is difficult to predict the outcome of this litigation, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning. New Source Review ("NSR"). The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements, if they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation’s coal-fired power plants. The strategy has included both the filing of suits against power plant owners and the issuance of NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. DP&L’s Stuart Station and Hutchings Station have received NOVs from the EPA alleging that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scope of the RMRR exclusion. Additionally, generation units partially owned by DP&L but operated by other utilities have received such NOVs relating to equipment repairs or replacements alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to DP&L-operated plants have not been pursued through litigation by the EPA.46If NSR requirements were imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the imposition of any such NSR requirements on our U.S. utilities, DP&L and IPL, the utilities would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.Regional Haze Rule. In July 1999, the EPA published the “Regional Haze Rule” to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas. On June 15, 2005, the EPA proposed amendments to the Regional Haze Rule that set guidelines for determining BART at affected plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" towards eliminating man-made haze by 2064. The amendment to the Regional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Class I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similar areas). The statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules. EPA previously determined that states included in the CSAPR would not be required to make source-specific BART determinations for BART-affected electric generating units, reasoning that the emissions reductions required by the CSAPR were “better than BART.” Concurrently, EPA also finalized a limited disapproval of certain states' plans — including Ohio’s — that previously relied on the EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule to improve visibility and substituted a Federal Implementation Plan that relies on the CSAPR. Environmental groups have challenged EPA’s determination than the CSAPR is “better than BART.” The challenge currently is stayed while challenges to the CSAPR in the D.C. Circuit proceed, because vacatur of the CSAPR would effectively vacate EPA’s actions related to BART.Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources under the so-called "Tailoring Rule." The regulations are being implemented pursuant to two CAA programs: the Title V Operating Permit program and the program requiring a permit if undergoing certain new construction or major modifications, the PSD program. Obligations relating to Title V permits include record keeping and monitoring requirements. Sources subject to PSD can be required to implement BACT. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule by regulating under the PSD program sources based solely on their GHG emissions. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the EPA could impose GHG BACT requirements for sources already required to implement PSD for certain other pollutants. Therefore, if future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources require PSD review for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements. The EPA has issued guidance on what BACT entails for the control of GHG and individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate impact of the BACT requirements applicable to us on our operations cannot be determined at this time as our U.S.-based businesses will not be required to implement BACT until one of them constructs a new major source or makes a major modification of an existing major source. However, the cost of compliance could be material.The EPA proposed a rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units on January 8, 2014. The proposed NSPS would establish CO2 standards of 1100 lbs/MWh for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of CO2 emissions from the plants. The NSPS also would impose standards of 1000 lbs/MWh for large NGCC facilities and 1100 lbs/MWh for smaller and peaking NGCC facilities. These standards would apply to any electric generating unit with construction commencing after January 8, 2014. The EPA is expected to issue the final NSPS during the summer of 2015. The Company cannot predict whether these standards will be changed prior to the rule becoming final but the NSPS could have an impact on the Company’s plans to construct and/or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations. The EPA issued proposed rules requiring states to establish GHG performance standards for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) on June 2, 2014. Under the proposed rule, called the Clean Power Plan (the "CPP"), states would be required to meet state-wide emission rate standards averaged across all fossil-fuel fired generation in the state. The requirements would begin in 2020 and would become increasingly stringent through 2030, with the goal being a 30% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP requires states to submit implementation plans to meet the standards set forth in the rule by June 30, 2016, with the possibility of one or two-year extensions under certain circumstances. The EPA also plans to propose a federal plan for meeting such standards, which states could adopt rather than developing their own state plans. The EPA is expected to finalize the rule in late summer 2015. Among other things, the Company's U.S.-based businesses could be required to make efficiency improvements to existing facilities. The EPA also issued proposed carbon pollution standards for modified and reconstructed power plants on June 2, 2014, which are also expected to be finalized this summer. However, it is too soon to determine what the CPP, and rules for modified and reconstructed power plants, and the corresponding state implementation plans for existing facilities affecting the Company’s U.S.-based businesses, will require once they are finalized, whether they will survive judicial and other challenges that have been commenced, and if so, whether and when the rule and the corresponding state implementations plan would materially impact the Company’s business, operations or financial condition.47Cooling Water Intake. The Company’s facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular, the Company’s U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA which seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the BTA for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published its final standards to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at large power plants and other industrial facilities. These standards require subject facilities that utilize at least 25% of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons per day for cooling purposes must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. This decision process would include public input as part of permit renewal or permit modification. It is possible this process could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment that achieves one of two alternatives under national BTA standards for entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this recent final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.At this time, it is contemplated that the Company’s Redondo Beach, Huntington Beach and Alamitos power plants in California (collectively, “AES Southland”) will need to have in place BTA by December 31, 2020, or repower the facilities. On April 1, 2011, AES Southland filed an Implementation Plan with the State Water Resources Control Board that indicated its intent to repower the facilities in a phased approach, with the final units being in compliance by 2024. The State Water Resources Board is currently reviewing the implementation plans and has requested additional information to assist with its evaluation. Power plants will be required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the Company cannot predict whether the federal EPA or California state requirements will be the more stringent and therefore applicable, but the Company anticipates compliance costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Water Discharges. Certain of the Company’s U.S.-based businesses are subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that regulate specific industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the United States under the CWA. In June 2014, the EPA along with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule defining the waters of the United States. This rulemaking has the potential to impact all programs under the CWA. Expansion of regulated waterways is possible based on initial review of the proposal, which may impact several permitting programs. Although we cannot at this time determine the timing or impact of compliance with any new regulations, more stringent regulations could have a material impact on our operations and/or consolidated financial results.On January 7, 2013, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issued an NPDES permit for J.M. Stuart Station. The primary issues involve the temperature and thermal discharges from the Station including the point at which the water quality standards are applied, i.e., whether water quality standards apply at the point where the Station discharge canal discharges into the Ohio River, or whether, as the EPA alleges, the discharge canal is an extension of Little Three Mile Creek and the water quality standards apply at the point where water enters the discharge canal. In addition, there are a number of other water-related permit requirements established with respect to metals and other materials contained in the discharges from the Station. The NPDES permit establishes interim standards related to the thermal discharge for 54 months that are comparable to current levels of discharge by Stuart Station. Permanent standards for both temperature and overall thermal discharges are established as of 55 months after the permit is effective, except that an additional transitional period of approximately 22 months is allowed if compliance with the permanent standards is to be achieved through a plan of construction and various milestones on the construction schedule are met. It is believed that compliance with the permit as written will require capital expenses that will be material to DP&L. The cost of compliance and the timing of such costs is uncertain and may vary considerably depending on a compliance plan that would need to be developed, the type of capital projects that may be necessary, and the uncertainties that may arise in the likely event that permits and approvals from other governmental entities would likely be required to construct and operate any such capital project. DP&L has appealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission and a hearing has been scheduled for March 2015. The compliance schedule in the final permit has been modified to accommodate the timing of the hearing. The outcome of such appeal is uncertain.On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Harding Street and Eagle Valley generating stations, which became effective in October 2012. NPDES permits regulate specific industrial wastewater and storm water discharges to the waters of Indiana under Sections 402 and 405 of the U.S. Clean Water Act. These permits set new levels of acceptable metal effluent water discharge, as well as monitoring and other requirements designed to protect aquatic life, with full compliance required by October 2015. IPL received an extension to the compliance deadline through September 2017 for IPL’s Harding Street and Petersburg facilities through agreed orders with IDEM. IPL conducted studies to determine what operational changes and/or additional equipment will be required to comply with the new limitations. In October 2014, IPL filed its wastewater compliance plans for its power plants with the IURC. IPL is seeking approval for a CPCN for the installation and operation of wastewater treatment technologies at IPL's Petersburg Plant and Harding Street Station, as well as 48the refueling of Harding Street Unit 7 from coal to natural gas (about 410 MW net capacity). If approved, IPL will invest $332 million in these projects to ensure compliance with the wastewater treatment requirements by 2017. IPL expects to recover through its environmental rate adjustment mechanism, operating or capital expenditures related to compliance with these NPDES permit requirements. Recovery of these costs is sought through an Indiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism with the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that IPL will be successful in that regard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of these permit requirements on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but it is expected to be material.In June 2013, the EPA proposed rules to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waterways by power plants. The proposed rules are intended to update the existing technology-based rules for controlling the discharge of pollutants from various waste streams associated with steam electric generating facilities. The proposed rules identify four preferred options for controlling the discharge of these pollutants, and the EPA believes that over half of existing power plants will comply with these rules, if they become final, without incurring costs. However, it is too early to determine whether the impacts of this rule, if and when it becomes final, will materially impact the Company or its subsidiaries. The EPA is required to finalize these rules by September 30, 2015.Waste Management. In the course of operations, the Company’s facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion residuals (“CCR”), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities include CCR, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and PCB contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. In December 2014, the EPA adopted a final rule regulating CCR under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final rule, expected to become effective in the summer of 2015, establishes nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments. The rule addresses location restrictions, liner design criteria, structural integrity requirements, operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, closure and post-closure care requirements, and record keeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. The Company's U.S. subsidiaries are still analyzing the potential impact and compliance cost associated with this final rule, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s businesses, financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such rule.Senate Bill 251. In May 2011, Senate Bill 251 became a law in the State of Indiana. Senate Bill 251 is a comprehensive bill which, among other things, provides Indiana utilities, including IPL, with a means for recovering 80% of costs incurred to comply with federal mandates through a periodic retail rate adjustment mechanism. This includes costs to comply with regulations from the EPA, FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, Department of Energy, etc., including capital intensive requirements and/or proposals described herein, such as cooling water intake regulations, waste management and coal combustion byproducts, wastewater effluent, MISO transmission expansion costs and polychlorinated biphenyls. It does not change existing legislation that allows for 100% recovery of clean coal technology designed to reduce air pollutants.Some of the most important features of Senate Bill 251 to IPL are as follows. Any energy utility in Indiana seeking to recover federally mandated costs incurred in connection with a compliance project shall apply to the IURC for a CPCN for the compliance project. It sets forth certain factors that the IURC must consider in determining whether to grant a CPCN. It further specifies that if the IURC approves a proposed compliance project and the projected federally mandated costs associated with the project, the following apply: (i) 80% of the approved costs shall be recovered by the energy utility through a periodic retail rate adjustment mechanism; (ii) 20% of the approved costs shall be deferred and recovered by the energy utility as part of the next general rate case filed with the IURC; and (iii) actual costs exceeding the projected federally mandated costs of the approved compliance project by more than 25% shall require specific justification and approval before being authorized in the energy utility’s next general rate case. Senate Bill 251 also requires the IURC to adopt rules to establish a voluntary clean energy portfolio standard program. Such program will provide incentives to participating electricity suppliers to obtain specified percentages of electricity from clean energy sources in accordance with clean portfolio standard goals, including requiring at least 50% of the clean energy to originate from Indiana suppliers. The goals can also be met by purchasing clean energy credits.CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (aka “Superfund”) may be the source of claims against certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companies already recognized as PRPs have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a contribution towards the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a PRP at the Tremont City landfill Superfund 49site. EPA has taken no further action with respect to DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation. In the second quarter of 2013, IPL retired in place five oil-fired peaking units with an average life of approximately 61 years (approximately 168 MW net capacity in total), as such units were not equipped with the advanced environmental control technologies needed to comply with existing and expected environmental regulations. Although these units represented approximately 5% of IPL’s generating capacity, they were seldom dispatched by Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. in recent years due to their relatively higher production cost and in some instances repairs were needed. In addition to these recently retired units, IPL has several other generating units that it expects to retire or refuel by 2017. These units are primarily coal-fired and represent 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this generation, in April 2013, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC in April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to 725 MW CCGT at its Eagle Valley Station site in Indiana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (106 MW net capacity each). In May 2014, the IURC issued an order on the CPCN authorizing the refueling project and granting approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at a total budget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $626 million. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance for debt and equity funds used during construction and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project until such time that we are allowed to collect both a return and depreciation expense on the CCGT and refueling project. The CCGT is expected to be placed into service in April 2017, and the refueling project is expected to be completed in early 2016. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and for the refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after the assets have been placed in service.As a result of existing and expected environmental regulations, including MATS, DP&L notified PJM that it plans to retire the six coal-fired units aggregating approximately 360 MW at its wholly owned Hutchings Generation Station. Hutchings Unit 4 was retired in June 2013. In conjunction with administrative agreements reached in 2013 with the EPA and Ohio’s Regional Air Pollution Control Authority that resolved alleged violations of air quality standards, DP&L accelerated its plans with respect to Hutchings Units 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 and those units are scheduled to retire by June 2015. DP&L removed equipment from such units so that combustion of coal was not possible after September 2013. Conversion of the coal-fired units to natural gas was investigated, but the cost of investment exceeded the expected return. In addition, DP&L owned approximately 207 MW of coal-fired generation at Beckjord Unit 6, which was operated by Duke Energy Ohio. Beckjord Unit 6 was retired effective October 1, 2014. At this time, DP&L does not have plans to replace the units that have been or will be retired.International Environmental RegulationsFor a discussion of the material environmental regulations applicable to the Company’s businesses located outside of the United States, see Environmental Regulation under the discussion of the various countries in which the Company’s subsidiaries operate in Business—Our Organization and Segments, above.CustomersWe sell to a wide variety of customers.

RISK FACTORS You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in .—Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.Risks Associated with our OperationsWe do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence as such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:57•economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;•high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•risks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations;•difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise;•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;•inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•adverse changes in government tax policy;•difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and•potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. A number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes. The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:•changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and•changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses’ results of operations, financial condition and prospects.In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results 58of operations. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.The hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Our businesses’ insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects.Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. For example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under- or over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs.We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long-term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers.Many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant’s output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our 59exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer’s obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us.Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the thirty one defined benefit plans, five are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Company’s exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. Future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries’ pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries’ liquidity.For additional information regarding the funding position of the Company’s pension plans, see Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 15—Benefit Plans included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K.Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales 60contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additional information regarding our projects under construction see, Item 1.—Business—Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K. In certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the development process. For example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement in place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement without financing in place). If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.In some of our joint venture projects and businesses and at The AES Corporation, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks.We have invested in some joint ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law. The AES Corporation entered into a Shareholders Agreement with Terrific Investment Corporation ("Investor"), a subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, in connection with the purchase of shares from AES in 2010. The Shareholders Agreement provides Investor with certain rights, including, without limitation, the right to nominate a Director to the Board of The AES Corporation, registration rights for the shares held by Investor, including demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights. Further information regarding the Shareholders Agreement can be found in the agreement itself, which is filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. In December of 2013, Terrific sold a significant percentage of its holdings, though it continues to hold over 8% of the Company’s outstanding shares. In the event that Terrific determines to sell additional shares of the Company, there could be a material impact on our share price.Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges.Wind Generation, our solar projects and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. 61As a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. Even where available, many of our renewable projects sell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through the sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emissions Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or Renewable Obligation Certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile.These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our management’s increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements.Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.7% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We could be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.Long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators are present whereas goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if potential impairment indicators are present. Otherwise, the recoverability assessment of long-lived assets is similar to the potential impairment evaluation of goodwill particularly as it relates to the identification of potential impairment indicators, and making estimates and assumptions to determine fair value, as described above.Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Information security breaches could harm our business.A security breach of our information technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and monitor operations could impact the reliability of our generation fleets and/or the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems. A security breach that impairs our technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customer information and limit our communications with third parties. Our security measures may not prevent such security breaches. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach 62could impair our reputation, expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections or otherwise impact our operations, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:•we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;•such businesses will perform as expected;•integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;•we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;•such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or•the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and LawsOur operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts’ expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:•changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;•changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility’s operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;•changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;•adverse changes in tax law;•changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;•changes in environmental law which impose additional costs on our subsidiaries;•changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•changes in the timing of tariff increases;•other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; •other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or•other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd-Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd-Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for commercial end-user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions. However, even with the exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for 63non-exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and/or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2012, the EMIR became effective. EMIR includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries’) efforts to comply with EMIR. It is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Our business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC and NERC, including PURPA, the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the NYISO and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under EPAct 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire.EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market.In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC’s regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.Our utility businesses in the U.S. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of 64property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1.—Business—US SBU—U.S. Utilities and Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We have not realized the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the DPL acquisition, and DPL continues to face business and regulatory challenges for further information on the regulation faced by our U.S. utilities. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1.—Business of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force the Company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with many of these companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal, but not exclusive, focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.As discussed in Item 1.—Business, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2014, the Company’s subsidiaries operated businesses which had total CO2 emissions of approximately 78.7 million metric tonnes, approximately 41.6 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol” reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 12.5 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries’ achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.The non-utility, generation subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs 65onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. The utility subsidiaries of the Company may seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to customers, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover such costs.Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial performance and the financial performance of the Company’s subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.In January 2005, based on European Community “Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading,” the EU ETS commenced operation as the largest multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires all developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are continuing to work to reach an international agreement on GHG emissions to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expired in 2012 but which is still observed by some countries. We cannot predict the impact of any such agreement, but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no federal legislation imposing a mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including for CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. However, the EPA has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Additionally, the EPA has proposed a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions for newly constructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW. The EPA has also proposed rules that would apply to modified or existing EUSGUs. Under the proposed rules, states would be judged against state-specific CO2 emissions targets beginning in 2020, with expected total U.S. power sector emissions reduction of 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed rules requires states to implement plans to meet the standards or adopt a federal plan the EPA will propose. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emission, see Item 1.—Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations—United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissions above.Such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing EUSGUs, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. See Item 1.—Business of this Form 10-K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations.At the state level, the RGGI, a cap-and-trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and California has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulations that require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below) and proposed Hawaii regulations relating to the collection of fees on GHG emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state GHG emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of California, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect such costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements.The regional auctions of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI occur approximately every quarter. Our subsidiary in Maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to RGGI in 2014. Of the approximately 41.6 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2014 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.36 million metric tonnes were emitted by our subsidiary in Maryland. The Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $3.4 million for 2015. There is a risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about 66providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. Further, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries’ GHG emissions. Unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries in the future. While the litigation mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Company’s business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company’s subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company.If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Company’s subsidiaries and on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non-United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non-United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non-United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.ITEM 1B
