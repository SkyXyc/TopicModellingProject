		ITEM 1
		
		
			BUSINESS
		
		
			 
		
		
			Vulcan Materials Company, a New Jersey corporation, is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.  We operated 335  aggregates facilities during 2014.
		
		
			VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION
		
		
			We are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the country with coast-to-coast aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			a favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			the largest proven and probable reserve base in the United States
		
			These factors allow us to provide attractive unit profitability through our strong operating expertise and price discipline.
		
		
			 
		
		
			
		
		
			STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS 
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Our aggregates reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in areas that are projected to grow faster than the national average and that require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate 75% of the total growth in U.S. population and 71% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020.

				 §
			
		
			
			We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow more rapidly and by divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 2014, we divested our Florida cement and concrete businesses for cash proceeds of $721.4 million and entered into a twenty-year aggregates supply agreement to provide aggregates to the divested concrete operations. We redeployed $331.8 million of this capital through acquisitions that added over 440 million tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves in key growth markets in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 80% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck, and another 15% are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water.  The remaining 5% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.
		
			COMPETITORS
		
		
			We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers accounted for approximately 30% to 35%  of total U.S. aggregates production in 2014. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than 10%.  Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			CRH plc 
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			HeidelbergCement AG
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Holcim Ltd.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Lafarge
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			MDU Resources Group, Inc.
		
			Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,000 companies managing over 10,000 operations during 2014, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or by extending their existing market positions.

			BUSINESS STRATEGY
		
		
			Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to build the hospitals, churches, schools, shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy.
		
		
			Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4) managing volume, product mix and price to grow profitability, and 5) effective land management. 
		
		
			1. AGGREGATES FOCUS
		
		
			Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows us to:
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES:  The locations of our reserves are critical to our long-term success because of barriers to entry created in many metropolitan markets by zoning and permitting regulations and high costs associated with transporting aggregates. Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities and, other than energy inputs required to process the materials, require virtually no other raw material. Our downstream businesses (asphalt mix and concrete) use Vulcan-produced aggregates almost exclusively.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER:  Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by shipments or by aggregates revenues. The 335 aggregates facilities we operated during 2014 provided opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting, accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.
		
			2. COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT
		
		
			Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly. In 2014, we expanded our operational footprint in Arizona, California, Texas,  Virginia and Washington D.C., and accessed new markets in New Mexico through acquisitions. These acquisitions, totaling $331.8 million of investment, added more than 440 million tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves serving markets where reserves are relatively scarce.
		
		
			The following graphic illustrates our projected percentage share of the growth (2010 – 2020) by key demographics for the United States:

			In January 2015, we exited the concrete market in California by swapping our ready-mix concrete operations for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.
		
		
			 
		
		
			3. PROFITABLE GROWTH
		
		
			Our long-term growth is a result of strategic acquisitions and investments in key operations.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Strategic acquisitions: Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix. In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition expanded our aggregates business in Florida and our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in other southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. In 2014, we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates business in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C., our asphalt mix business in Arizona and New Mexico,  and our ready-mixed concrete business in New Mexico. 
		
			In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Reinvestment opportunities with high returns: During the current decade,  Moody's Analytics projects that 75% of the U.S. population growth,  71% of household formation and 64% of new jobs will occur in Vulcan-served states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth create many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve costs.

			4. MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY
		
		
			We commonly think of three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Price for Service — We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Operating Efficiency and Leverage — We  focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycle. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. 
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Sales and Production Mix — We adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions. Managing inventories responsibly results in improved cost performance and an improved return on capital.
		
			We manage these factors locally, and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow  us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively.  As a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing,  since 2012, our Aggregates segment’s gross profit has increased 55% on volume improvement of 15%. 
		
		
			 
		
		
			
		
		
			 
		
		
			While Aggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years, we have not yet fully realized our maximum unit profitability.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			On Price for Service — Our expanding margins have yet to benefit from the mid-to-high single digit price gains associated with cyclical recoveries. We believe that these gains will begin to take hold in 2015.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			On Operating Efficiency and Leverage — We are operating a capital-intensive business at 50-60% capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward. 
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			On Sales and Production Mix — As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the end-use mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.
		
			5. EFFECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT
		
		
			We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue to focus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

			PRODUCT LINES
		
		
			We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:
		
		
			
				 1.
			
		
			
			Aggregates
		
			
				 2.
			
		
			
			Asphalt Mix
		
			
				 3.
			
		
			
			Concrete
		
			
				 4.
			
		
			
			Calcium (formerly Cement)
		
			1. AGGREGATES
		
		
			A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business, including markets, the location and quality of reserves and demand cycles.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Local markets: Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, are produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Diverse markets: Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector construction projects, such as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Location and quality of reserves: We currently have 15.8 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth depends on aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Demand cycles: Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high.

			In addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Highly fragmented industry: The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,000 companies that manage over 10,000 operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Relatively stable demand from the public sector: Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privately funded construction,  and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges), which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Limited product substitution: There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, due to technical specifications many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete, but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Moreover, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Widely used in downstream products: In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates as a raw material are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix and 78% of ready-mixed concrete.
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Flexible production capabilities: The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand. 
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			raw material inputs largely under our control: Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.
		
			 
		
		
			AGGREGATES MARKETS
		
		
			We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.
		
		
			PUBLIC SECTOR CONSTRUCTION
		
		
			Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways, bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2014, publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 50%  of our total aggregates shipments.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Public Sector Funding: Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal surface transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades, a portion of transportation projects has been funded through a series of multi-year bills. Some 40% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects. The long-term nature of such legislation is important because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This Trust Fund receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 2014,  approximately 26%  of our aggregates sales by volume was used in highway construction projects.

				 §
			
		
			
			federal highway funding: On August 8, 2014, Congress passed an extension of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). The two-year federal highway bill had received strong bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012. The extension of MAP-21 provides state departments of transportation with federal highway program authority through May 31, 2015. The extension continues federal support for transportation infrastructure programs at current funding levels, helping rebuild America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.
		
			MAP-21 maintained essentially level funding in Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, with approximately $105 billion for total transportation funding through Fiscal Year 2014. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016, adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program. Congressional leaders have stated their intention to act in 2015 to replace the extension of MAP-21 with a multi-year authorization that includes revenue stability for federal surface transportation programs.
		
		
			The extension of MAP-21 maintained the baseline increase to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program increased to $1.75 billion over the two-year MAP-21 period, from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway bill known as SAFETEA-LU. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10, creating the potential for $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates this TIFIA funding supports $30 to $50 billion in new construction. Given administrative requirements and other factors, the TIFIA program began to have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments in 2014, and should continue to do so into 2015 and beyond.
		
		
			TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including large portions of our footprint. The program provides credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects. Eligible sponsors include state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.
		
		
			MAP-21’s positive framework for future authorizations was continued in the extension passed this summer. Its significant reforms, consolidation and simplification of federal highway programs, acceleration of the project delivery process, and expanded project financing and promotion of public-private partnership opportunities have paved the way for further progress as Congress works to pass a new multi-year highway bill. 
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			WATER INFRASTRUCTURE: In June 2014, President Obama signed into law the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), providing legal authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pursue hundreds of navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers, canals, ports and inland waterways throughout the nation. We, along with numerous business allies, strongly supported WRRDA for its importance to the U.S. economy, the pressing need to upgrade U.S. harbors, ports and inland waterways, and for construction projects using our products. The law addresses a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects, focused on improved port dredging, and streamlines permitting to speed up project delivery. Many of the large southern ports that would benefit from WRRDA, as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes related to expansion of the Panama Canal, lie within our footprint. Additionally, WRRDA includes innovative public-private authorizations and a new Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA), modeled after the TIFIA program.  As enacted, WIFIA is authorized to support large projects exceeding $20 million that otherwise would go unaddressed. As with TIFIA, it provides funding for up to 49% of a project's estimated cost, involves low interest rates, and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the government's interest in order to encourage other investors.

			Private sector CONSTRUCTION
		
		
			The private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction. In 2014, privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 50%  of our total aggregates shipments.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Nonresidential Construction: Private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.
		
			Contract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggregates. In 2014,  total nonresidential contract awards, as measured in square feet, increased for the 4th year in a row. Private nonresidential contract awards were up approximately 59 million square feet, or 9%. Office buildings, retail construction and manufacturing facilities accounted for all of this growth. Employment growth, attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market.
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			Residential Construction: The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in our markets continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the United States. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing.
		
			U.S. housing starts, as measured by Dodge Analytics data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually. In 2014, total annual housing starts surpassed 1 million units. The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.
		
		
			ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
		
		
			We sell aggregates that are used as ballast for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways. In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime.
		
		
			We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "Segment Reporting" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

			our reserves are primarily located in high-growth markets that require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			zoning and permitting regulations in many metropolitan markets have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			such regulations, while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas, could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations
		
			2. ASPHALT MIX
		
		
			We produce and sell asphalt mix in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt Mix segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.
		
		
			Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt Mix segment customers from our local production facilities.

			3.  CONCRETE
		
		
			We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia,  Washington D.C. and the Bahamas. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.
		
		
			In March  2014, we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. For additional details see Note 19  “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
		
		
			This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 78% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.
		
		
			We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. 
		
		
			Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.
		
		
			4. CALCIUM (FORMERLY CEMENT)
		
		
			As previously noted, in  March  2014, we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. For additional details see Note 19  “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We retained our former Cement segment’s calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida. This facility produces calcium products for the animal feed, paint, plastics, water treatment and joint compound industries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry.
		
		
			OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED ITEMS
		
		
			SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
		
		
			Almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by a number of factors including changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.
		
		
			CUSTOMERS
		
		
			No material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 6.4% of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than 2.2% of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

			ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
		
		
			Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety; examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2015 and 2016 will be approximately $11.0 million and $10.7 million, respectively. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position.
		
		
			Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.
		
		
			For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
		
		
			PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
		
		
			We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents, registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.
		
		
			OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING VULCAN
		
		
			Vulcan is a New Jersey corporation incorporated on February 14, 2007, while its predecessor company was incorporated on September 27, 1956. Our principal sources of energy are electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. We do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments in 2015.
		
		
			As of January 1, 2015, we employed 6,598 people in the United States. Of these employees, 607 are represented by labor unions. Also, as of that date, we employed 342 people in Mexico and 1 in the Bahamas,  292 of whom are represented by a labor union. We do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2015.

		ITEM 1A 
		
		
			RISK FACTORS
		
		
			 
		
		
			An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The following is a list of our risk factors.
		
		
			ECONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKS
		
		
			Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures  — Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.
		
		
			Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business  — A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a "cap and trade" system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The EPA has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule, referred to as the "Tailoring Rule," which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the Federal Clean Air Act. With the sale of our Newberry cement plant in March 2014, we no longer have a facility subject to either the reporting or permitting rule, although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time.
		
		
			Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.
		
		
			The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change, legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
		
		
			GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
		
		
			Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs —  The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are significantly vertically integrated. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.

			Our long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings  — Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry sites often take years to develop; therefore, our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.
		
		
			Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.
		
		
			FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS
		
		
			Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume  — Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our profits and profit margins are negatively affected by significant decreases in volume.
		
		
			Significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 2014 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.
		
		
			We have substantial debt and our credit ratings are non-investment grade — Our operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest, and in some years, principal payments. Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments depends on our operating and financial performance. Our ability to refinance maturing debt depends on our financial performance and the state of the capital markets (particularly for non-investment grade debt). Operating and financial performance is, in turn, subject to general economic and business conditions, many of which are outside of our control.  
		
		
			Our debt instruments contain various  covenants, including: affirmative (e.g., maintain insurance), negative (e.g., restrictions on lines of business), informational (e.g., provide financial statements) and financial (e.g., minimum EBITDA to interest ratio) covenants. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain alternative or additional financing could be impaired.

			We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results  — As discussed more fully in "Critical Accounting Policies" under Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we use significant judgment in accounting for:
		
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			goodwill and goodwill impairment
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			reclamation costs
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			pension and other postretirement benefits
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			environmental compliance
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			claims and litigation including self-insurance
		
			
				 §
			
		
			
			income taxes
		
			We believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
		
		
			PERSONNEL RISKS
		
		
			Our future success is dependent upon a management team and divisional structure that are new — Since January 1, 2014, we have experienced significant changes in our management team as part of the Company’s management succession plan and new division organizational structure. Our future success depends in large part upon the effective transition of our new management team and the new divisional structure. If there are further changes in management or organizational structure, such changes could be disruptive and could negatively affect our operations, strategic planning and performance.
		
		
			Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations — A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.
		
		
			We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business — We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). Failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us. In addition, we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships, which may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments.
		
		
			OTHER RISKS
		
		
			We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks — Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.
		
		
			Weather can materially affect our operating results  — Almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather. Therefore, our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather.

			Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings  — Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets. The costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.
		
		
			We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability  — In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.
		
		
			We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — We are involved in several complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals and Metals businesses. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12 "Commitments and Contingencies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
		
		
			We are involved in certain environmental matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant environmental matters see Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
