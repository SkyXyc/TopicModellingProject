ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves various risks.  When considering an investment in Baker Hughes, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report.  There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial.  Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in Baker Hughes.Risk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas IndustryOur business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact, either positively or negatively, the markets for oil and natural gas.  Expenditures by our customers for exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, their expectations for future energy prices, the risks associated with developing the reserves, their ability to finance exploration for and development of reserves, and the future value of the reserves.  Their evaluation of the future value is based, in part, on their expectations for global demand, global supply, spare productive capacity, inventory levels and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices.  The key risk factors we believe are currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.  Changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results.Demand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services, is highly correlated with global economic growth, and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East who are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average.  Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers’ spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results.  Incremental weakness in global economic activity, particularly in China, India, Europe, the Middle East and developing countries in Asia, could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices.  Incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices.  In addition, demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation, including cap and trade legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations.Supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.Productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate.  The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.  Advanced technologies, such as horizontal 9drilling and hydraulic fracturing, improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation in the future.Productive capacity in excess of demand (“spare productive capacity”) is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies.  Spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand.  High or increasing storage, inventories, or spare productive capacity generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften.  Low or decreasing storage, inventories, or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise. Access to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves.  Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced.Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries, including, but not limited to, Norway and Russia, are willing and able to control production and exports of oil, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives.  Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services.  Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities.  Over the past year oil prices have declined significantly due in large part to increasing supplies, weakening demand growth and OPEC's position to not cut production.  Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers.  While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers.  Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk.  Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.Our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.Our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments and resulting returns.  Limited access to external sources of funding has and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally-generated cash flow.  In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts.Seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.Variation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand.  Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.  Extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.10Risk Factors Related to Our BusinessOur expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors:We operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.We operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel.  Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers.  In order to be competitive, we must provide new technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers, and successfully recruit, train and retain competent personnel.  Our investments in new technologies and property, plant and equipment may not provide competitive returns.  Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services.Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results.  Development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results.We may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.The high cost or unavailability of infrastructure, materials, equipment, supplies and personnel, particularly in periods of rapid growth, could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories.  Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over supply of raw materials and component parts.  Raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys (including chromium and nickel), titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks.  Our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers.  A lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog, which may limit our ability to respond to orders with short lead times.People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world.  Our ability to manage the recruiting, training, retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business.  A well-trained, motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business.  Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and retain our employees, while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate.  Likewise, if the downturn in the economy or our markets continues or other changes occur such as a decline in our stock price, we may have to make further impairments of our assets or adjust our workforce to control costs and may lose our skilled and diverse workforce.  Labor-related actions, including strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business.Our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats.Geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we do business.  Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.11Our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest, government expropriations and/or epidemic outbreaks.In addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks, civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business.  Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest.  Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by, among other things, restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas.Our business could be impacted by cybersecurity risks and threats.Threats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and it is possible that breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time.  Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers’ operations, loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.Our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.Our ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees.  Our compliance program is also dependent on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the Baker Hughes Business Code of Conduct.  We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results.  In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.We have operations in the U.S. and in more than 80 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate.  Compliance related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings.  Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate.  In addition, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.Changes in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results.Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.  In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.  If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially impacted.Our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters.  These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts.  We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law.  Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.12Changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling may adversely affect our business and operating results and reduce the need for our services in those areas.Legislation and regulation in the U.S. and other parts of the world of the offshore oil and natural gas industry may result in substantial increases in costs or delays in drilling or other operations in the Gulf of Mexico and other parts of the world, oil and natural gas projects becoming potentially non-economic, and a corresponding reduced demand for our services.  If the U.S. or other countries where we operate, enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling or contracting services operations, higher operating costs could result and adversely affect our business and operating results.If the Company were to be involved in a future incident similar to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident, the Company could suffer significant financial losses that could severely impair the Company.  Protections available to the Company through contractual terms and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect the Company in the event we were involved in that type of an incident.Compliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.Our business is impacted by material changes in environmental laws, rulings and litigation.  Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws, including (without limitation) our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are only our forecasts regarding these matters.  These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as:  changes in law that impose new restrictions on air emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; more stringent enforcement of existing environmental regulations; a change in our allocation or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a PRP, including (without limitation) Superfund sites; the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials.International, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  In the U.S., the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations.  In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules setting GHG emission standards for the oil and natural gas industry.  We are unable to predict whether the proposed changes in laws or regulations will ultimately occur or what they will ultimately require, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union Emission Trading System; the United Kingdom's Carbon Reduction Commitment which affects more than 40 Baker Hughes facilities; and, in the U.S., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, and various state programs implementing California Assembly Bill 32.Current or future legislation, regulations and developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business.  Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs.  Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.  If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.13Demand for pressure pumping services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law.Some federal, state and foreign governmental bodies have adopted laws and regulations or are considering legislative and regulatory proposals that, if signed into law, would among other things require the public disclosure of chemicals used in well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) operations in more detail than the Company currently provides and would subject well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) to more stringent regulation with respect to, for example, construction standards for wells intended for hydraulic fracturing, certifications concerning the conduct of well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) operations, management of flowback waters from well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) operations, or other measures intended to prevent operational hazards.  Such federal, state or foreign legislation and/or regulations could impair our operations, increase our operating costs, and/or greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company’s well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) services.  The EPA and other governmental bodies are studying well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) operations.  Government actions relating to the development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources may impede the development of these resources by our customers, delaying or reducing the demand for our services.  We are unable to predict whether the proposed changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.Uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results.We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings.  We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available; however, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation.  This insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions.  The insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices.  In addition, the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage:•we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;•we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;•our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or•the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.Whenever possible, we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability.  However, state law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of the agreement with the customer may not recognize those limitations of liability and/or limit the customer’s indemnity obligations to the Company.  In addition, insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks from an event like a well control failure that can lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment.  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations.Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies.  State-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as joint ventures, that could be difficult or undesirable for the Company to meet.  The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the Company’s operations in those countries.  In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require the Company to assume additional risks.Many state-owned oil companies and other operators may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts and the Company may choose to provide services outside its core business.  Providing services on an integrated or 14turnkey basis generally subjects the Company to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements.Currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.Fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business.  Most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in U.S. Dollars or local currency indexed to U.S. Dollars; however, some of our revenue, local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in U.S. Dollars and may impact our results of operations.Changes in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.The condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary.  If the Company’s credit rating is downgraded, this could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility and commercial paper program, as well as the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew or obtain or issue new debt financing.The Company has a significant concentration of its business in North America.For the year ended December 31, 2015, over one-third of our revenue was attributable to North America compared to approximately one-half of our revenue attributable to North America for the year ended December 31, 2014.  In North America, a decrease in demand for energy or in oil and natural gas exploration and production, or an increase in competition could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results.Our restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and could increase, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.During 2015, we implemented a number of restructuring activities to reduce expenses, which included a reduction in our workforce, the termination of various contracts, the closing or abandoning of certain facilities, and the downsizing of our presence in select markets.  There can be no assurance that our restructuring activities will produce the cost savings we anticipate in the expected timeframe or that the cumulative restructuring activities and charge will not have to increase in order to achieve our cost savings targets.  Any delay or failure to achieve the expected cost savings and any increase in our anticipated cumulative restructuring activities and charge would likely cause our future earnings to be lower than anticipated.Risk Factors Related to the Pending Merger with HalliburtonOur expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending Merger with Halliburton:The pendency of our Merger with Halliburton could adversely affect our business.In connection with our pending Merger with Halliburton, some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the Merger is completed.  We have agreed in the Merger Agreement to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs during the pendency of the Merger, which restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the Merger is delayed and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The process of seeking to accomplish the Merger could also divert the focus of our management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us.We may be unable to attract and retain key employees during the pendency of our Merger with Halliburton.In connection with our pending Merger with Halliburton, current and prospective employees of Baker Hughes may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger.  Key 15employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger.The ability of Baker Hughes and Halliburton to complete the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect Baker Hughes or cause the Merger to be abandoned.Each of Baker Hughes and Halliburton must make certain filings with and obtain certain other approvals and consents from various federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities.Baker Hughes and Halliburton have not yet obtained the regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the Merger.  Governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the Merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the Merger.  Baker Hughes and Halliburton will be unable to complete the Merger until approvals are received from the U.S. Department of Justice, the European Commission and various other governmental authorities.  Regulatory authorities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval.  The Merger Agreement may require Baker Hughes and/or Halliburton to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company.  If review by the relevant competition authorities extends beyond April 30, 2016, the Merger Agreement does not terminate automatically; the parties may continue to seek relevant competition approvals or either of the parties may terminate the Merger Agreement.Additionally, even after the statutory waiting period under the antitrust laws and even after completion of the Merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the Merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest.  In addition, in some jurisdictions, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the Merger, before or after it is completed.  Baker Hughes or Halliburton may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.Failure to complete our Merger with Halliburton could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.If our Merger with Halliburton is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and will be subject to several risks, including the following:•the attention of our management may have been diverted to the Merger instead of on our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;•resulting negative customer perception could adversely affect our ability to compete for, or to win, new and renewal business in the marketplace;•having to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger;•the trading price of Baker Hughes common stock may decline to the extent that the current trading price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and•the Company could be subject to litigation from shareholders related to the Merger Agreement.Following our Merger with Halliburton, the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating the businesses of Baker Hughes and Halliburton and realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger.The Merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies.  The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the Merger, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration.  Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:•the inability to successfully integrate the respective businesses of Baker Hughes and Halliburton in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the Merger, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;16•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and•performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating the companies’ operations.ITEM 1B
